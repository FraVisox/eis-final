Avon and Somerset police said they were investigating 50 suspected brothels in residential settings such as holiday flats. The force also said almost half of the intelligence reports about human trafficking and modern slavery it received in August centred on the exploitation of women and girls in off-street prostitution. Officers say brothels are being set up not only in Bristol and other urban centres but in the countryside. There have been reports of brothels being established close to the vast building site on the Somerset coast where the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is taking shape. Sgt Emma Slade, who has responsibility for policing prostitution in Avon and Somerset, said: “Vulnerable women are being enslaved and exploited for sex within pop-up brothels. They are isolated and suffer terrible abuse. Many of the women are recruited and trafficked on false promises of legitimate work but find themselves in a very different circumstance.” Slade said that when police carried out safeguarding visits to brothels, they often found women from the far east and eastern Europe who spoke no English and did not know the emergency services phone number. As of September, the force had identified and was investigating 76 suspected brothels, 26 of which were in commercial premises such as massage parlours and the rest in residential properties. Slade said officers relied on landlords, property owners, hosts and neighbours to report suspicious activity. “We would encourage property hosts or nearby residents to remain vigilant and report any activity that appears unusual or suspicious at short-term rental premises. We rely on the intelligence that we receive from the public and even the smallest piece of information can help us to build a picture,” she said. Operating from short-term and holiday rental properties instead of a permanent address makes it easier for those exploiting the girls and women to avoid detection. The properties can be easily booked online without the need for large deposits or for the tenants to meet the hosts during the stay. Supt Mark Edgington, the force’s lead for modern slavery, said: “Pop-up brothels in short-term rental properties are increasingly being reported across the UK and it is important that property hosts are able to recognise the signs of potential modern slavery and sexual exploitation. “Many hosts are completely unaware their properties could be used for this or the signs they should be looking out for. If using an online booking service, we would always suggest that hosts check the profile of anyone requesting to book their property and read the reviews from other hosts. “Some online services will also allow hosts to require that all guests provide identification before they are able to book. This can give some assurance that the tenant is really who they say they are.” The police said some of the signs to look out for were: Multiple women staying under one roof or a large number of women regularly being brought to and taken from the property. Different men calling at the property (both day and night) and staying for only a short period of time. Windows being blacked out or curtains left constantly closed. A sudden increase in residential waste at a property, or more waste than would be expected for the number of tenants. Occupants appearing malnourished, unkempt or withdrawn. Two years ago Devon and Cornwall police issued a similar warning to owners of holiday lets to beware of sex workers using their premises as pop-up brothels. The force said that in one resort alone, Newquay, they had discovered 14 such establishments in five months and believed more had operated but had not been discovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:49:03Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear plans 'risk collapse if Hitachi talks fail'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear plans 'risk collapse if Hitachi talks fail'","bodyText":"Britain’s hopes for a number of new nuclear power stations could collapse if the government and the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi fail to make a breakthrough on talks for a plant in Wales, a top nuclear lobbyist has warned. Hiroaki Nakanishi, the firm’s chairman, met Theresa May earlier this month, to press the prime minister for financial support for two reactors at Wylfa on the island of Anglesey. The company’s board is understood be meeting on Monday to decide whether it can proceed with the UK’s subsequent offer, believed to include a multibillion-pound loan. Tim Yeo, chairman of the industry-backed group New Nuclear Watch Europe, said the outcome of the negotiations had huge consequences for other international firms hoping to build reactors in Britain. “If Hitachi walk away from Wylfa that probably spells the end of new nuclear in the UK,” he said. The 3GW plant at Wylfa by the Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power would be the UK’s second new nuclear power station after EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C, under construction in Somerset. More are planned: EDF wants to build at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast, South Korea’s Kepco at Moorside in Cumbria and China’s CGN at Bradwell in Essex, with EDF’s help. Hitachi wants to build abroad because of a moribund home market, while the UK government sees nuclear as an important source of low-carbon power. Despite the protracted discussions between the two parties, London appears to still be committed to making the economics of nuclear work. “I sense there’s still a lot of political will to make new nuclear happen from government, and backbenchers seem to want it in their areas,” a Whitehall source said. An industry source said the deal would work if the government offered some form of financial support directly, while energy bill payers footed the rest through a subsidy known as a contract for difference. That would mean Hitachi receiving a guaranteed price of power, likely to be around £80 a megawatt hour, lower than Hinkley’s £92.50 but still nearly twice the wholesale cost of electricity. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is understood to be enthusiastically backing the project, while the Treasury, which would have to see an equity contribution or loan for the construction period on government books, is more sceptical. Paul Dorfman at the Energy Institute at University College London said: “This would mean the hardworking UK taxpayer and energy consumer, who are labouring under ramping austerity, are being asked to stump up for an extraordinarily expensive nuclear plant just at the time that renewable costs are plummeting.” Japanese media have reported the UK government’s loan for the project could be as much as £13bn, and put the total cost of the plant at more than £20bn, even more than Hinkley Point C. The details are understood to have been leaked by the Japanese government, not Hitachi, and the UK government has said it “does not recognise” the reports. Greenpeace said the UK was wrongly pursuing a “dinosaur” technology and should focus on renewables, batteries and interconnectors to other countries. Kate Blagojevic, the group’s head of energy, said: “It’s unacceptable the Japanese public are hearing about this before the British public, if what we’re hearing is true that over £13bn of British taxpayer money is going to a Japanese company to build a plant in Wales. “It’s pretty outrageous the government hasn’t been upfront about what they’re proposing and why.” A spokesperson for BEIS said: “These discussions are commercially sensitive and we have no further details at this time.” A Horizon spokesperson said: “It’s no secret we’re in discussions with the UK and Japanese governments, and have been for some time, over support for our project. With these discussions still ongoing it is too early to comment on the specifics of what a future deal may look like. “We’re confident, given the strategic importance of our project to both nations, we’ll reach a successful conclusion to these discussions in the near future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/dec/13/european-green-deal-to-press-ahead-despite-polish-targets-opt-out","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-13T09:08:16Z","webTitle":"European Green Deal to press ahead despite Polish targets opt-out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/european-green-deal-to-press-ahead-despite-polish-targets-opt-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/dec/13/european-green-deal-to-press-ahead-despite-polish-targets-opt-out","fields":{"headline":"European Green Deal to press ahead despite Polish targets opt-out","bodyText":"European Union leaders have vowed to press on with a major economic plan to confront the climate emergency, despite Poland’s opt-out from a net-zero emissions target by 2050. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told journalists he had secured an exemption for Poland on the 2050 target, which is meant to become the legally binding centrepiece of the “European Green Deal” , a plan to transform Europe’s economy announced two days ago. Poland, which relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, is angling for more precise and generous commitments of EU funds to move away from fossil fuels before it agrees to implement the target. “Poland will be reaching climate neutrality at its own pace,” Morawiecki said. Morawiecki had even floated the idea that Poland should be able to meet the target in 2070, an idea shot down in the leaders’ talks that ran hours over schedule. The European council president, Charles Michel, who wanted a success at his first summit in the chair, declared victory on the 2050 target, despite the ambiguity about Poland. “Climate neutrality by 2050 is our common goal,” he told journalists after 10 hours of talks. “But at the same time it is correct that for one member state, at this stage, it is not possible to commit to implement this objective.” He added: “It is very important for the European Union, the strong message today is we want to become the first climate neutral continent by 2050.” Leaders expect Poland to sign up to implementing the target in June. The French president Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “Yes Europe will be the first carbon neutral continent! We did it together last night. Let’s move on now to implement the green new deal.” Asked whether the EU had a common goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, one diplomat said “nearly”, adding: “It’s not the strongest political signal you could give. You have 27 saying they support it and Poland saying we don’t object if the others support it.” A greater diplomatic embarrassment was narrowly averted – following a previous failure to agree the target in June – via some linguistic gymnastics in the EU summit text. “The European council [of EU leaders] endorses the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. One member state, at this stage, cannot commit to implement this objective as far as it is concerned, and the European council will come back to this in June 2020,” states the text, which was agreed after hours of wrangling over timetables and money. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Poland’s position would not deter the commission from moving ahead with the next steps of the green deal. She has promised to publish details of a €100bn (£83bn) “just transition fund” in January to help European economies make the green transition, in addition to €1tn the European Investment Bank has said it plans to generate from public and (mostly) private sources. Von der Leyen said she accepted it was necessary for Poland “to have a closer look” at the details of the just transition fund. EU leaders were more successful in bringing into the fold two other countries that had previously opposed the target: the Czech Republic and Hungary. Both want generous guarantees of EU funds for their green transition. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who had gone into the summit discussion “all guns blazing”, according to one diplomatic source, came onboard after an agreement that nuclear energy could be referenced in the summit text. He claimed: “Nuclear energy is clean energy, without any emissions. And I don’t know why a lot of countries have a problem with this.” EU member states are free to choose whether to use nuclear power, but the debate over the controversial energy source bogged down the discussions for hours, with Luxembourg’s anti-nuclear government opposed to any reference in a climate text. The tense discussion on the 2050 target heralds even more difficult talks on agreeing tougher greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030. The commission wants to cut the EU’s emissions by at least 50% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels), but that requires member states taking decisive steps to decarbonise their economies in the short term. Campaigners said the EU’s decision fell short of the action needed. “A target 30 years in the future in 2050 does not represent emergency action, and it absolutely must be matched with immediate action to dramatically reduce climate emissions everywhere,” Susann Scherbarth, climate justice spokesperson for Friends of the Earth Europe, said in a statement. “The huge demonstrations of people calling for climate justice know that all of Europe must phase out all fossil fuels, including gas, in the next decade – today’s announcement won’t reassure them of a safer future. “Like the green deal unveiled by the European commission yesterday, this promise risks being too late and too vague on details how it will be achieved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2020/feb/05/scott-morrison-insists-he-will-not-be-bullied-coalition-splits-climate-widen","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-05T06:59:34Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison insists he will not be 'bullied' as Coalition splits on climate widen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/05/scott-morrison-insists-he-will-not-be-bullied-coalition-splits-climate-widen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2020/feb/05/scott-morrison-insists-he-will-not-be-bullied-coalition-splits-climate-widen","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison insists he will not be 'bullied' as Coalition splits on climate widen","bodyText":"The new Liberal MP Katie Allen has canvassed the need for the government to appoint a dedicated climate change minister, as the Coalition splits on how best to “evolve” its policy response. Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition. Allen’s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government’s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government’s message. She argued that the “significant investment” being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community. Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government’s policies. Both Allen and Wilson declined to comment on the discussion. Wilson was one of the MPs who spoke in Tuesday’s partyroom in favour of more ambitious climate action and has also urged the government to consider nuclear power. His call for more action was backed up by Allen, along with the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, and the North Sydney MP, Trent Zimmerman, who argued that the government needed to ensure it respected divergent views on the issue, and acknowledged the strength of feeling for more action in inner city seats. Nationals MPs George Christensen, Barnaby Joyce and David Gillespie argued that the government should not succumb to pressure from inner city voters to do more on climate, with Joyce saying it was a “hobby horse” that was being pursued through the tragedy of bushfires. On Wednesday morning, following the partyroom stoush, Morrison said he would not “be bullied” into more action on climate change. “We listen to Australians right across the country. Not just in the inner city,” Morrison told Channel Nine. “It’s important to listen to everybody but take people forward on practical, balanced action that doesn’t go and write people’s jobs off, or industries off,” Morrison said. “It’s about technology, not taxation. So we won’t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we’ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges.” Morrison also dismissed overnight calls from the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, for other countries to join Britain in striving for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. “I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn’t tell the Australian people what it would cost them,” Morrison said. As the Coalition seeks to reposition on climate, Morrison faced questions in Parliament about the government’s response to the bushfires. In response to a question from the Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, asking for a bipartisan approach to climate change in the wake of the crisis, Morrison said Australia was already acting. “Emissions reduction is important. We’re acting on that reduction. I can tell you also resilience to climate is also important,” Morrison said. “Hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future. “Also, in a country ravaged by drought, and the impacts that we have experienced, and that drought continues, building dams is climate action now.” The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, asked Morrison why the government had not called a meeting of state governments when the bushfire crisis began – a request made in writing to the prime minister by Labor on 22 November. Morrison said the government had responded in an “unprecedented” manner to the fires, and it was “disappointing” that Labor was trying to “politicise the bushfires”. Earlier, Liberal MP John Alexander used his condolence speech on the bushfires to call climate change “the elephant in the room”. “Today is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change – they are climate change,” he said. “The leader of the opposition said that ‘this is not normal’. I fear this is actually the new normal. “In focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours. We must obviously mitigate future risks and change our ways, but we also must adapt because these longer, hotter summers will be our new normal.” The challenge facing Morrison to balance the Coalition’s competing constituencies was further highlighted on Wednesday, when the new Nationals party deputy leader, David Littleproud, argued that the government should look to retrofit coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions. Party leader Michael McCormack, who survived a leadership challenge on Tuesday, said the government was taking action on emissions reduction in a “responsible way”. “We don’t want to be sending industry offshore. And there is a future for coal in this country.” But despite the divergent views, home affairs minister Peter Dutton rejected suggestions the party was divided. “I don’t see huge points of difference in our party room,” he told the ABC. “Obviously, as we’ve all pointed out, we’re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it, or more, that have been charged with arson. That’s not climate change.” There is no evidence that anything like that number of people have been arrested over alleged arson in connection with this summer’s bushfires, let alone charged. As the political debate over climate action continues to rage, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, told the National Press Club that the cost to the economy of bushfires and drought saying they were “a stark reminder that the economic effects of these climate events are material”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/apr/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-warship-seriously-damaged-after-ammunition-explosion-us-to-send-800m-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-15T05:04:33Z","webTitle":" Zelenskiy urges European countries to give up Russian oil that provides ‘blood’ money to Moscow – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/apr/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-warship-seriously-damaged-after-ammunition-explosion-us-to-send-800m-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/apr/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-warship-seriously-damaged-after-ammunition-explosion-us-to-send-800m-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-live","fields":{"headline":" Zelenskiy urges European countries to give up Russian oil that provides ‘blood’ money to Moscow – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining us today for all the unfolding developments in Ukraine. We will be closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest news on our new blog below. It is approaching 8am in Ukraine. Here is where the situation currently stands: Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy has praised his people’s bravery and resolve on the 50th day of war, calling Russia’s invasion “absurd” and “suicidal” in his latest national address. “We have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five,” he said. The Russian flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine, according to Russia’s defence ministry. It is still unclear whether the ship was hit by Ukrainian weaponry. Ukraine claims it was, but Russia maintains that a fire on board and then “stormy sea conditions” while it was being towed to port were to blame. Russia only has three of this flagship class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors, and the loss of the Moskva is a big blow. The former CIA director David Petraeus described Russia’s admission as a “rare moment of truth … I’m surprised that they admitted it,” he told the BBC. Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the CIA director, William Burns, has said. During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership … none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the assault began on 24 February. Rainy weather in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region could favour the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned Russian offensive, a senior Pentagon official has said. “The fact that the ground is softer will make it harder for them to do anything off of paved highways,” the official, who spoke under condition of anonymity, told AFP. Russia has asked Brazil for support in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20 group of top economies to help it counter crippling sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters. On 30 March the Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov wrote asking for Brazil’s “support to prevent political accusations and discrimination attempts in international financial institutions and multilateral fora”. A Brazilian economy minister spokesperson indicated that Brazil would like Russia to remain part of discussions at multilateral organisations. At least 503 civilians, including 24 children, have been killed in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, the region’s local governor has said. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city with a prewar population of about 1.5 million, is 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow would take “security and defence measures that we will deem necessary” if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would “seriously worsen the military situation” and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Finland and Sweden had earlier taken a major step towards joining Nato. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has appealed to the United Nations to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been “illegally deported” to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had “engaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation”. France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged allies to resume their normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine. Turkey is still working on organising a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy, said the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the condition for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents is a document ready for the two leaders to sign. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the Chelsea football club director Eugene Tenenbaum in an attempt to freeze up to £10bn of assets linked to the club’s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. The UK said it was extending sanctions to Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, another close associate of Abramovich, because the oligarch had transferred billions of pounds of assets to the pair as Russia invaded Ukraine. Zelenskiy further urged European countries to give up Russian oil that provides “blood” money to Moscow, and appealed for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion. A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with 289 of those from Mariupol. The head of the UN World Food Program, meanwhile, said people were being “starved to death” in the besieged city. Moody’s Investors Service has said that Russia “may be considered in default” if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May. Russia paid two bonds in rubles this month after sanctions cut the country off from global financial systems and the US banned Moscow from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks. The payments in rubles “represent a change in payment terms” and may be considered a default, according to Moody’s. S&amp;P Global Ratings has also declared Russia in default. A Russian legislator and two aides pushed a covert propaganda campaign aimed at winning US government support for Russia’s foreign policy agenda, including moves against Ukraine, according to a Justice Department indictment seen by the Associated Press. Russian troops in the Donetsk direction are focused on attempts to capture the towns of Popasna and Rubezhnoye, Ukraine’s military has said in its latest operational report this morning. However, attempts so far have been “unsuccessful”, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said. Officials also claimed Ukrainian soldiers successfully thwarted eight Russian attacks in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions over the past 24 hours. In somewhat ironic timing, the sinking of Russian warship Moskva in the Black Sea comes days after Ukraine issued a stamp immortalising the famous exchange on Snake Island between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s postal service announced on Tuesday it had issued a postage stamp showing a Ukrainian solider standing defiant in the foreground of a Russian warship. Roman Hrybov — the Ukrainian soldier who uttered the phrase “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” — was invited to the ceremony unveiling the stamp, the service said in a statement. A Ukrainian presidential adviser confirmed on Thursday the Moskva was one of the vessels involved in the exchange between Russian troops and defenders of Snake Island in February during the first few days of the war. Ukraine’s possibly demonstrated ability to target warships in the Black Sea may change Russian operating patterns, forcing them to deploy additional air and point-defence assets to the Black Sea or withdraw vessels from near the coast, the institute for the study of war has said in its latest report. The loss of the Moskva - regardless if from a Ukrainian strike or an accident - is a “major propaganda victory for Ukraine” and a “boon to Ukrainian morale” the institute claims. The Kremlin will conversely struggle to explain away the loss of one of the most important vessels in the Russian fleet. The Kremlin’s current story of losing the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet due to an accidental fire and ammunition explosion will, at minimum, likely hurt Russian morale and cannot be hidden from the Russian domestic audience. Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies—either poor air defences or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship.” The institute added that the loss of the warship will reduce Russia’s ability to conduct cruise missile strikes but is “unlikely to deal a decisive blow to Russian operations on the whole”. The Moskva’s main role was likely conducting precision strikes with Kalibr cruise missiles on targets in Ukrainian rear areas, including logistics centres and airfields, the report added. These Russian strikes have been effective but limited in number compared to airstrikes and ground-launched cruise missiles throughout the invasion, and the loss of the Moskva is unlikely to be a decisive blow. Ukraine’s possibly demonstrated ability to target Russian warships in the Black Sea may change Russian operating patterns, however, forcing them to either deploy additional air and point-defence assets to the Black Sea battlegroup or withdraw vessels from positions near the Ukrainian coast.” Japan will attend a G20 finance ministers’ meeting next week, finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Friday, as western nations called for expulsion of Russia from the forum and boycotting sessions where Moscow is represented. “The Japanese government is not in the position to respond to each country’s participation,” Suzuki told a press conference when asked about Russia’s plans to join the forum online, which current G20 president Indonesia announced on Thursday. Last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States will boycott some G20 meetings if Russian officials show up. German finance minister Christian Lindner has called for rejection of any form of cooperation with Russia at the G20. The upcoming G20 meeting “is a very important conference to discuss various issues of the global economy, including rising food and energy prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine...where participation of each country’s finance minister and central bank governor is basically expected,” Suzuki said. Meanwhile, Japan “will take appropriate steps in close cooperation with G7 allies and the host country Indonesia” based on a March G7 leaders’ statement that said international platforms should not continue relations with Russia in a business as usual manner, Suzuki said. Slovakia’s defence minister Jaroslav Nad called Russian President Vladimir Putin as “equal to Hitler” for his invasion of Ukraine, in an interview with The New York Times. Nad told the Times that Putin “is equal to Hitler” and he must be stopped in Ukraine before he can make moves towards the west. “Ukraine is literally fighting for our future,” he added. Slovakia shares a border with Ukraine and has been been vocal in its criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine President Zelenskiy has marked the 50th day of war, calling Russia’s invasion “absurd” and “suicidal” in his latest national address. “We have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five,” he began. I remember the first day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I remember what I was told on February 24 ... To put it mildly, no one was sure that we would withstand it. Everyone sympathised. Many of them advised me to flee the country. Advised to actually surrender to tyranny. But they didn’t know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want. Not the people who rule in such a way that their army sees toilets for the first time in their lives in the occupied territories and steals even ordinary household appliances. Zelenskiy said Russian troops “are already repeating on our land what Europe saw only during World War II” while criticising the west’s severity of sanctions. “50 days of our defence is an achievement. Achievement of millions of Ukrainians,” he added. During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world. For those who have the courage to call a spade a spade. For those who are not poisoned by propaganda. You have all become heroes. All Ukrainian men and women who withstood and do not give up. And who will win. Who will return peace to Ukraine. I’m sure of it.” Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. Rainy weather in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region could favour the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned Russian offensive, a senior Pentagon official has said. For several days, rain has battered Donbas and is expected to continue in the coming days, AFP reports. “The fact that the ground is softer will make it harder for them to do anything off of paved highways,” said the official, who spoke under condition of anonymity. The weather already played an important role in Ukraine’s north at the beginning of the invasion, when the fact that the ground was not sufficiently frozen forced Russian tanks to circulate in long convoys on paved roads, making them vulnerable to the Ukrainian forces’ Javelin anti-tank systems. The Donbas region, which is geographically situated on a large plane, is more favourable to armed vehicles. “The weather will certainly be a factor in war,” the official added. Canada will send up to 150 troops on a humanitarian mission to Poland to support its massive influx of Ukrainian refugees, defence minister Anita Anand announced Thursday. With more than half of Ukraine’s over 4.7 million asylum seekers having gone to neighbouring Poland, the Nato ally is facing a refugee crisis and has asked for assistance. Only 100 of the total number of troops assigned to the mission will be deployed immediately, Anand told a news conference at Trenton Air Force Base in Ontario, adding that they would “assist Poland’s efforts to support and care for Ukrainians fleeing violence.” The soldiers, who are fluent in Ukrainian, are to be sent to frontline reception centres across Poland to “provide general support, spiritual services and limited medical care,” she said. They will also support a Poland-led humanitarian task force, and help resettle Ukrainians in Canada. Russia has asked Brazil for support in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20 group of top economies to help it counter crippling sanctions imposed by the west since it invaded Ukraine, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov wrote to economy minister Paulo Guedes asking for Brazil’s “support to prevent political accusations and discrimination attempts in international financial institutions and multilateral fora.” “Behind the scenes work is underway in the IMF and World Bank to limit or even expel Russia from the decision-making process,” Siluanov wrote. He did not elaborate on obstacles to Russian participation in those institutions, and his allegations could not be independently verified. The letter was dated 30 March and relayed to the Brazilian minister by Russia’s ambassador in Brasilia on Wednesday. “As you know, Russia is going through a challenging period of economic and financial turbulence caused by sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies,” the Russian minister said. Asked about the letter, Erivaldo Gomes, the Brazilian economy ministry’s secretary of international economic affairs, indicated that Brazil would like Russia to remain part of discussions at multilateral organisations. “From Brazil’s point of view ... keeping open dialogue is essential,” he said. “Our bridges are the international bodies and our assessment is that these bridges have to be preserved.” At least 503 civilians have been killed in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, the region’s local governor has said. “This is an innocent civilian population, we will not forgive them for any life!” Oleg Synegubov wrote on Telegram, adding that the dead included 24 children. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city with a pre-war population of some 1.5 million, is located some 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. It has been a key target for Moscow’s invading forces, which have battered it with bombardments but failed to capture the city. A Russian legislator and two aides pushed a covert propaganda campaign aimed at winning US government support for Russia’s foreign policy agenda, including moves against Ukraine, according to a Justice Department indictment seen by the Associated Press. The effort was part of what American officials describe as a broader Russian government objective to sway public opinion in its favour, to sow discord in American institutions and to drive wedges between the US and European allies. In this case, prosecutors say, the legislators sought to co-opt American and European political officials — including members of the US Congress — and also sought to enter the US under false pretences to participate in meetings. The legislator, Aleksandr Babakov, 59, is identified in the indictment as a high-ranking Russian government official from the same political party as Russian President Vladimir Putin who currently serves as deputy chairman of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature. Two of his staff members — Aleksandr Nikolayevich Vorobev, 52, and Mikhail Alekseyevich Plisyuk, 58 — were also charged in Manhattan’s federal court. All three men named are based in Russia and remain at large, authorities said. They are accused of conspiring to have a US citizen act as a foreign agent for Russia and Russian officials without notifying the Justice Department; with conspiring to evade US sanctions; and with visa fraud conspiracy. Today’s indictment demonstrates that Russia’s illegitimate actions against Ukraine extend beyond the battlefield, as political influencers under Russia’s control allegedly plotted to steer geopolitical change in Russia’s favour through surreptitious and illegal means in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West,” Manhattan US attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Such malign foreign interference will be exposed, and we will pursue justice against its perpetrators.” The United States is preparing new efforts to crack down on sanctions evasion by Russia, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser said on Thursday. “Where our focus will be over the course of the coming days is on evasion,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Reuters reports. “I think we’ll have some announcements in the next week or two that identify targets that are trying to facilitate that evasion both inside Russia and beyond,” he said, without giving details on the coming plans. But Sullivan did say that Washington has no desire to give back yachts and other assets seized from people they see as oligarchs with ties to Putin. “The president is actively looking at how we can deal with the fact that as we seize these assets, our goal is not to give them back,” he said. “Our goal is to put them to a better use than that. But I’ll be careful in what I say today because there’s an ongoing - kind of - policy process around how we end up dealing with that question. But rest assured that the goal is not just to sit on them for a while and then pass them all back.” A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Of that, 289 people evacuated from the besieged southern port of Mariupol by their own transport, Vereshchuk said in an update over the Telegram messaging app. The head of the UN World Food Program (WFP) said people are being “starved to death” in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, and predicted the country’s humanitarian crisis is likely to worsen in the coming weeks. WFP executive director David Beasley said the war is “devastating the people in Ukraine” and lamented the lack of access faced by the agency and other aid organisations in trying to give food supplies to areas caught up in fighting. “I don’t see any of that easing up. I just don’t see it happening right now,” he said in an interview with the Associated Press. A lack of access is part of the problem, he said, but so is a shortage of manpower and fuel as resources are diverted to the war effort. “It’s not just going to be the next few days — but the next few weeks and few months could even get more complicated than it is now,” he said. “In fact, it’s getting worse and worse, concentrated in certain areas, and the front lines are going to be moving.” Beasley expressed particular concern about the port city of Mariupol, where a dwindling number of Ukrainian defenders is holding out against a Russian siege that has trapped well over 100,000 civilians in desperate need of food, water and heating. Russian forces that control access to the city have not allowed in aid, even though the WFP has demanded access. “We will not give up on the people of Mariupol and other people that we cannot reach. But it’s a devastating situation: the people being starved to death,” he said. Meanwhile, former CIA Director David Petraeus has described Russia’s admission that its flagship has sunk as a “rare moment of truth”. “I’m surprised that they admitted it,” he told the BBC, adding that the facts would have “come out” eventually. CIA director, William Burns, also acknowledged the US is sharing intelligence with Ukraine. “We have been committed to rapid and effective intelligence sharing with our Ukrainian partners, throughout the fighting and for months beforehand.” Burns said it was important to publicly disclose intelligence before the 24 February invasion because “we had clear evidence of [Putin] trying to pin the blame on Ukrainians, wrongly, for provoking a conflict.” Burns said a protracted war is a strong possibility and Putin has developed an almost “mystical belief” that it’s his destiny to restore Russia’s stature in the world. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine, CIA director William Burns has said. During a speech at Georgia Tech university in Atlanta, Burns said: Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” The Kremlin said it placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the assault began on 24 February, but the United States has not seen “a lot of practical evidence” of actual deployments that would cause more worry, Burns added. We’re obviously very concerned. I know President Biden is deeply concerned about avoiding a third world war, about avoiding a threshold in which, you know, nuclear conflict becomes possible.” We are seeing reports of explosions in Kyiv. The Guardian has yet to verify accounts, and it is unclear what damage has been caused. The Russian flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine, according to Russia’s defence ministry. It is still unclear whether the ship was hit by Ukrainian weaponry. Ukraine claims it was – whereas Russia maintains a fire on board and then “stormy sea conditions” while it was being towed were to blame. Russia only has three of this flagship class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors - and the loss of Moskva is a big blow. The lives of some 2.7m people with disabilities are at risk in Ukraine, a UN committee has warned, citing reports that many are trapped or abandoned in their homes, care centres and orphanages without basic supplies or medicines. The Committee said it was “deeply disturbed” that the fate of people with disabilities in Ukraine is “largely unknown”. Russia has warned Nato that if Finland and Sweden were to join the military alliance, then it would take measures in the Baltic. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, said: “There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored.” Finland and Sweden took a major step towards joining Nato yesterday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said Moscow will take “security and defence measures that we will deem necessary” if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would “seriously worsen the military situation” and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Russia’s investigative committee said Ukrainian forces carried out at least six helicopter airstrikes on the village of Klimovo in the Russian region of Bryansk, injuring seven people. The Bryansk region governor said earlier that two residential buildings in the village had been hit by shelling, which is north of the Ukrainian region of Chernihiv. Additionally, a village in Russia’s Belgorod region had come under fire from Ukraine, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has appealed to the United Nations to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been “illegally deported” to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had “engaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation”. France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged allies to resume normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine. US president Joe Biden also signalled on Thursday that his administration is in the process of deciding whether to send a high-ranking US official to Ukraine. Turkey is still working on organising a meeting between Russia’s Vadimir Putin and Zelenskiy, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the condition for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents is a document ready for the two leaders to sign. The UK government has imposed sanctions on Chelsea football club director Eugene Tenenbaum in an attempt to freeze up to £10bn of assets linked to the club’s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. The UK said it was extending sanctions to Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, another close associate of Abramovich, because the oligarch had transferred billions of pounds of assets to the pair as Russia invaded Ukraine. Zelenskiy has issued a video compiled by his government that further urges European countries to give up Russian oil that provides “blood” money to Moscow, and appeals for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion. It begins with ominous music and text on screen saying: “Fifty days of evil in Europe.” Then, over images of consumers filling up their gas tanks, and of oil wells, captions read: “We ask you to stop feeding evil”. Moody’s Investors Service has said that Russia “may be considered in default” if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May. Russia paid two bonds in rubles this month after sanctions cut the country off from global financial systems and the US banned Moscow from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks.But the payment sin rubles “represents a change in payment terms” and may be considered a default, according to Moody’s. S&amp;P Global Ratings has also declared Russia in default due to its inability to pay bonds in US dollars. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Joanna Walters, Maanvi Singh Guardian staff and agencies report: A criminal case has been opened against a Siberian journalist whose news website published content critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian media reported on Thursday. Mikhail Afanasyev, chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces on Wednesday over the website’s reporting on 11 riot police who allegedly refused deployment to Ukraine. Afanasyev was accused Thursday of disseminating “deliberately false information” about the Russian armed forces, an offence which carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence under a law passed last month. The charges come amid an unprecedented crackdown on independent media and anti-war dissent. Last month, the Russian parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Afanasyev has published numerous investigations into sensitive issues in Khakassia, such as organised crime and alleged abuses of power by local officials. In 2009, he was accused of libel after publishing stories that criticised the Russian government’s response to an explosion at the country’s largest hydroelectric plant that year. And in 2016, he reportedly faced death threats from a criminal gang active in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, after he detailed the group’s illegal activities and suspected ties to local police. Another Siberia-based journalist was also arrested Wednesday on suspicion of breaching Russia’s new laws on media coverage of the situation in Ukraine. Sergei Mikhailov, founder of the LIStok weekly newspaper based in the Republic of Altay, was reportedly placed in pre-trial detention over the outlet’s alleged “calls for sanctions against Russia.” Read more: The day Russian troops invaded Ukraine, 18-year-old Oleksandr Ivanov was shot in the forehead and 10 times in the chest while in the passenger seat of his grandmother’s car. They had been driving to Hostomel, outside Kyiv, to pick up his grandfather and bring him to the capital. Oleksandr, known as Sasha, did not have the life of an ordinary 18-year-old. His mother, Sveta, was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when Sasha was three. Sasha had spent his life taking care of her, helping her dress, wash and go to the toilet. Sasha had a natural love of learning, according to his family. From when he started to talk, he loved reciting poetry. At the age of seven he asked if he could learn to play the piano. Despite finishing music school with honours, he decided to study medicine. He attained full marks in Ukraine’s national high school exams for chemistry and biology and was given a scholarship to Ukraine’s best medical school, in Kyiv. Another top university, Taras Shevchenko University, also in Kyiv, rang his mother to complain when they heard he would not be coming to them. Read more: US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the way the Moskva saga “has unfolded is a big blow to Russia”. US officials have said it is still unclear what caused a blast onboard. But Sullivan said it has forced Moscow to choose between two stories. “One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other is that they came under attack. And neither is a particularly good outcome for them,” Sullivan said at the Economic Club of Washington, DC. “Only the loss of a ballistic missile submarine or the Kutznetsov [Russia’s lone aircraft carrier] would inflict a more serious blow to Russian morale and the navy’s reputation with the Russian public,” said Carl Schuster, the former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. Russia’s Moskva missile cruiser sank in a “stormy sea” while being towed, the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank” Russia and Ukraine have conflicting accounts of what happened to the cruiser, with Ukraine claiming it began to sink after it was hit by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles, and Russia saying a fire on board caused munitions to explode. Moody’s Investors Service has said that Russia “may be considered in default” if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May. Russia paid two bonds in rubles this month after sanctions cut the country off from global financial systems and the US banned Moscow from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks. But the payment sin rubles “represents a change in payment terms” and may be considered a default, according to Moody’s. S&amp;P Global Ratings has also declared Russia in default due to its inability to pay bonds in US dollars. Russia is now moving closer and closer to its first failure to repay debts since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Russia’s defence ministry has put out a statement to say its Moskva missile cruiser has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine. It is still unclear whether the ship was hit by Ukrainian weaponry. The ship is believed to have experienced significant damage and was thought to be heading to Sevastopol, Crimea, before it succumbed. Russia earlier claimed it had experienced damage as a result of an ammunition fire on board. The crew were evacuated. Ukraine claimed the ship has sunk, Russia denied it, then came reports that Russia was towing its ships further out to sea, perhaps to take them out of Ukrainian missile range. The Moskva was apparently under tow when it sank. Russia only has three of this flagship class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has issued another video compiled by his government that further urges European countries to give up Russian oil that provides “blood” money to Moscow, and appeals for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian president tweeted out a video, in similar fashion to ones issued before, and an example of which was particularly arresting when he played it in the middle of his video address to the US Congress last month. The video shows very graphic images of the effects of the violence perpetrated on Ukrainians by Russian forces and weapons and we won’t embed it here, intentionally, as it quickly becomes upsetting with little warning. Here is a link to the tweet. Zelenskiy tweeted the following text to go with the video: They’ve been trying to destroy us for 50 days, but the people are heroically resisting. We fear nothing, we know what we’re fighting for. We are brave enough to put an end to evil. Stop feeding the military machine. Help with weapons. Then peace &amp; good will win faster. It begins with ominous music and text on screen saying: “Fifty days of evil in Europe. Is there anything else that Russia hasn’t done yet in Ukraine?” The video is only just over a minute and a half long but uses images of wounded and dead children, blood-soaked toys and streets, huge structural damage and the wailing of Ukraine’s bereaved. Beneath such images, the captions read, in answer to the rhetorical question posed above: “Murdering children, destroying entire cities, mining playgrounds, missile strikes on refugees, mass murder, stealing...[Russia] telling bald-faced lies to the whole world.” Then, showing images of consumers filling up their cars with gasoline, and oil wells, the captions said: “We don’t ask you to resist evil instead of us, we ask you to stop feeding evil, and provide us with weapons,” with images of weapons such as fighter jets that the west has declined to supply to Zelenskiy, judging it too provocative to Russian president Vladimir Putin and risking NATO and Russia going to war. Then, against a backdrop of the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag, the caption says that Ukrainians have enough bravery to defeat evil and images show patriotic countrymen, both military and civilian, fighting back against the invasion. France said on Thursday its embassy in Ukraine would return to the capital Kyiv from the western city of Lviv, where it had been relocated in early March after the Russian invasion, Agence France-Presse reports. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made the announcement during a telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. This redeployment will happen very soon and will allow France to deepen its backing for Ukraine even further in all spheres to face the war unleashed by Russia on February 24,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. France, however, continues to advise its nationals against returning to Ukraine, including to Kyiv. We consider returning remains unthinkable for those French people who lived in Ukraine. The return of French compatriots today remains formally prohibited,” the French government noted on Tuesday, stressing that “the whole of Ukraine remains a war zone”. France is providing support to Ukraine through military equipment, humanitarian aid and assistance for investigations into abuses allegedly committed by Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians, in addition to humanitarian supports for Poland and Moldova, which are hosting many Ukrainian refugees. In recent days a number of other nations have said they will reopen their embassies in Kyiv, following the withdrawal of Russian forces that had been advancing on the sprawling capital before their efforts were thwarted, including the Czech, Italian, Portuguese and Turkish embassies and the European Union office. Joe Biden signalled on Thursday that his administration is in the process of deciding whether to send a high-ranking US official to Ukraine. The US president noted that he would be ready to go himself, but talk in Washington circles is that any such move would be more likely to involve US secretary of state Antony Blinken or defence secretary Lloyd Austin. Biden spoke to gathered reporters as he was boarding Air Force One on the outskirts of the capital, on his way to North Carolina on a trip related to his domestic agenda. When Biden was in Poland last month, he gave all the signs that he wanted to visit Ukraine and hinted he might go, but it did not happen and it appeared that it was too dangerous at that time. That was before Russian forces withdrew from their advance on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Since the withdrawal, a number of European leaders have visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv including, last weekend, British prime minister Boris Johnson, with images whirling around the world of him walking the streets with Zelenskiy after a meeting and press conference. Blinken briefly crossed onto Ukrainian soil in early March, while visiting the Polish border, but it was essentially an entirely symbolic gesture of solidarity. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s southern military command said it struck the Russian flagship cruiser Moskva with a Neptune missile and that the ship had started sinking. Russia’s defence ministry denied the reports and said the Moskva had “retained buoyancy”, with fires extinguished and the crew transferred to another vessel after an ammunition explosion on the ship on Wednesday night. The Pentagon confirmed Moskva is on fire but still afloat and moving across the Black Sea, although US defence officials said it was unclear what caused a blast onboard the ship. The lives of some 2.7m people with disabilities are at risk in Ukraine, a UN committee has warned, citing reports that many are trapped or abandoned in their homes, care centres and orphanages without basic supplies or medicines. The Committee said it was “deeply disturbed” that the fate of people with disabilities in Ukraine is “largely unknown”. Russia has warned Nato that if Finland and Sweden were to join the military alliance, then it would take measures in the Baltic. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, said: “There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored.” Finland and Sweden took a major step towards joining Nato yesterday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries.

That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today. I’m handing the blog to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. Thank you for reading. The lives of around 2.7 million people with disabilities are at risk in Ukraine, a UN committee has warned, Reuters reports. Citing reports that many are trapped or abandoned in their homes, care centres and orphanages without basic supplies or medicines, the Committee of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities published a statement that read: The committee is deeply disturbed that the fate of people with disabilities in Ukraine is largely unknown. People with disabilities have limited or no access to emergency information, shelters and safe havens, and many have been separated from their support networks, leaving them unable to respond to the situation and navigate their surroundings. It noted that few people with disabilities were among those internally displaced or who had reached Ukraine’s borders as refugees, “indicating that many of them have not been able to flee to safety”. Turkey is still working on organising a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said. Speaking to the Turkish news channel NTV, Cavusoglu said Turkey continues to approach talks between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents with “cautious optimism”, adding: We know critical topics will be decided at leader level, so we will try to bring leaders together. He acknowledged that recent events of alleged war crimes in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha and Irpin have “created a negative atmosphere on the Ukrainian side”. Despite all those challenges, President Zelensky said talks may continue… But it takes two leaders to say yes. Especially President Putin. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused European countries that continue to buy Russian oil of “earning their money in other people’s blood”. In an interview with the BBC, Zelenskiy singled out Germany and Hungary, accusing them of blocking efforts to embargo energy sales, from which Russia stands to make up to £250bn this year. Zelenskiy also urged western countries to send more weapons to Ukraine: The United States, the United Kingdom, some European countries – they are trying to help and are helping. But still we need it sooner; sooner and faster. The key word is now. Alexei Navalny has called for an “information front” against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the jailed opposition leader asserted that poll results showing 75% of Russians support the conflict were a “Kremlin lie”. In an extended series of tweets, Navalny called on western leaders to support a massive social media ad campaign in order to break through Kremlin propaganda regarding the invasion. “We need ads. Lots of ads,” wrote Navalny. “A huge national anti-war campaign will start with an advertising campaign. Two hundred million impressions a day to reach every Russian internet user twice. Stories, posts and prerolls. Across Russia, in cities and villages. On every tablet and every phone.” In the statement, he called on Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, Ursula von der Leyen, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the head of Google owner Alphabet, to “urgently find a solution to crush [Vladimir] Putin’s propaganda using the advertising power of social media”. The advertising campaign would be a way around the Kremlin’s efforts to shut down independent media in Russia. Along with most independent websites and newspapers, the Russian censor has also blocked access to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It also marks the opposition leader’s biggest foray yet into the complicated question of how widely the Russian public supports the war in Ukraine. Polling results, including from the independent Levada Centre, have shown majority support among Russians for the war. Germany’s chancellor is under growing pressure to authorise the delivery of heavy weaponry to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s looming eastern offensive, with Olaf Scholz’s coalition partners accusing him of failing to live up to his promises. The centre-left leader had surprised even close partners in his three-party coalition when on 27 February he announced an “epochal change” in Germany’s foreign policy to boost defence spending and relax its restrictive stance on exporting weapons to conflict zones. Six weeks on, prominent politicians from allied parties urged the Social Democrat to follow up words with actions after Germany was accused of stalling on delivering heavy weaponry to Ukraine and blocking a wholesale ban on Russian oil and gas. Scholz has to “not just purse his lips but start to whistle”, said the Free Democratic party’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, who chairs the Bundestag’s defence committee. With a view to the apparent failure of economic sanctions in stopping Vladimir Putin’s military campaign, she said there had to be a renewed focus on hard power. “There is only one answer that Russia understands: to continue to try to end the war through talks – but with one hand visibly on the holster,” said Strack-Zimmermann. “That means that Germany has to also supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help it defend itself, as long as they can be handled by the Ukrainian army.” Western officials have said the intelligence picture about the state of the Moskva warship is not yet clear but that there are doubts about the Russian version of events. “I am not aware previously of a fire onboard a capital warship which had led to the ammunition magazine exploding as a consequence,” one official said, calling it “remarkably inept” if true. Officials said it was credible that the Ukrainian forces had damaged the ship with a Ukrainian missile system they had developed. “The fact that it’s been damaged to a point where it is either inoperable or under tow is a significant blow,” the official said, adding that there would have been “enormous determination, ingenuity and initiative of Ukrainian forces in order to be able to strike at Russian forces where perhaps they previously thought they were invulnerable, and a significant impact on Russian maritime operations”. Western officials said it was unlikely British anti-ship missiles were involved in the apparent attack. Johnson promised on his recent trip to Kyiv that those would be made available, but the official said that had not happened yet. “It would appear that it’s not a UK capability,” the official said. The UK has trained the Ukrainian navy in the past as part of Operation Orbital but the official said it was “difficult to draw a causal link” between the British training and the operation. Western officials also warned that the weather in the east of Ukraine was having a major impact on the redirected Russian offensive, with no new major successes for Russia in the Donbas. It’s 7.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s southern military command said it struck the Russian flagship cruiser Moskva with a Neptune missile and that the ship had started sinking. Russia’s defence ministry denied the reports and said the Moskva had “retained buoyancy”, with fires extinguished and the crew transferred to another vessel after an ammunition explosion on the ship on Wednesday night. The US believes the warship is still on fire and afloat, a senior US defence official said. Russia has warned Nato that if Finland and Sweden were to join the military alliance, then it would take measures in the Baltic.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, today denied that the Russian president had refused to meet his Ukrainian counterpart. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, visited Kyiv today as the first foreign minister on the UN security council to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion of the country began on 24 February. Coveney said: “Even though Ireland is militarily neutral, let me be clear we are not neutral on this war and conflict and the future of your country.” The UK has announced sanctions against two Russian oligarchs: Chelsea football club director, Eugene Tenenbaum, and another associate of Chelsea’s owner Roman Abramovich, David Davidovich. Tenenbaum will be subject to an asset freeze as well as transport sanctions. Davidovich will be also subject to an asset freeze and travel ban as well as transport sanctions. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The United States believes the Russian warship Moskva is still dealing with a fire, Reuters cites a senior US defence official as saying. The ship is believed to have experienced significant damage and is thought to be heading to Sevastopol, Crimea, the official said: Our assessment is that she still appears to be battling a fire on board. Russia’s defence ministry said the crew had been evacuated and measures were being taken to tow the ship back to port, after an explosion of ammunition on board that Ukraine said was caused by a missile strike. The US official said the US cannot confirm what caused the fire on the Moskva. It very well could have been from an external source like a missile. That range is not out of range for a Neptune. Sixty miles is well within the Neptune’s effective range. But it also could have been something else. So again, … we’re just being careful here.” The UK government has announced sanctions against two Russian oligarchs: Chelsea football club director, Eugene Tenenbaum, and another associate of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, David Davidovich. Tenenbaum will be subject to an asset freeze as well as transport sanctions meaning that any ship or aircraft owned, chartered, controlled or operated by him could be detained if it enters Britain. Davidovich, described as Abramovich’s “much lower profile right-hand man”, will be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban as well as transport sanctions. Both men have been sanctioned for their close association with Abramovich, the government said. In a statement, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: We are tightening the ratchet on Putin’s war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table. Germany has seized the world’s largest superyacht after “extensive investigations” determined that it is owned by the sister of the sanctioned the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov. The German federal police said on Thursday it had seized the $600m (£458m) Dilbar after weeks of painstaking financial investigative work exposed the yacht’s true ownership despite a complex web of “offshore concealment”. The vessel is flagged in the Cayman Islands and registered to a holding company in Malta – both tax havens favoured by the global ultra-rich to park their wealth. German authorities said they had determined the yacht was ultimately owned by Usmanov’s sister Gulbakhor Ismailova. Usmanov, a telecoms magnate who owns the £48m mansion Beechwood House in Highgate, London and the 16th-century Sutton Place estate in Surrey, was sanctioned by the UK last month. The billionaire, who has had significant interests in the English football clubs Arsenal and Everton, had already been sanctioned by the EU and the US. Ismailova and another of Usmanov’s sisters, Saodat Narzieva, have also been subjected to UK and EU sanctions. The UK government said Usmanov “indirectly transferred assets to Ismailova, including leaving his sister as the only beneficial owner of the yacht Dilbar”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said Moscow will take “security and defence measures that we will deem necessary” if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership of Sweden and Finland in the military alliance would “seriously worsen the military situation” and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Grushko said: It is clear that our border with Finland is 1,300 km long. This will mean a radical change in the military and political situation and it is understandable that we will be forced to take security and defence measures that we will deem necessary. He added: Otherwise, this will seriously worsen the military situation and bring about the most undesirable consequences that need to be avoided. Although diplomatic contacts between the countries are “maintained”, Grushko said: Sweden and Finland have joined the sanctions and are participating in the anti-Russia campaign unleashed in the West. This is today’s reality. The Russian minister’s comments came after Sweden and Finland took a major step towards joining Nato on Wednesday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said her country would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said there was “no point” in delaying analysis of whether it was right for Sweden to apply for Nato membership: This is a very important time in history. The security landscape has completely changed. We have to analyse the situation to see what is best for Sweden’s security, for the Swedish people, in this new situation. Russia’s defence ministry said it was investigating what happened to its flagship cruiser Moskva after Ukraine said it had hit the vessel with an anti-ship missile, forcing its crew to abandon ship, Luke Harding, Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer report. The ministry denied reports the warship had sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea. It said the Moskva had “retained buoyancy”, with fires extinguished and the crew transferred to another vessel. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, was unable to give the cause of the explosion on the warship, saying: “I can’t tell you anything. This is a topic for the ministry of defence.” Ukraine’s southern military command said on Thursday it struck the Moskva with a Neptune missile and that the ship had started sinking. Fire had erupted after the missile exploded, it said on Facebook. It added that four Russian ships that went to the Moskva’s rescue were hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard. Unconfirmed reports suggested the missile cruiser had turned upside down and had started to sink. Commissioned in 1983, the ship was armed with 16 anti-ship Vulkan cruise missiles with a range of at least 440 miles (700km). According to reports, it also carried S-300 anti-air missiles, which are crucial to Russia’s air superiority over Crimea and Ukraine’s Kherson province, now occupied by Russian troops. Russia has said it will be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons, as the war in Ukraine entered its seventh week. Here is a map showing how Nato membership in Europe has grown over the years since it was founded in 1949 by 12 countries including the US and Canada. The most recent new members have been Montenegro in 2017 and North Macedonia in 2020. The total number of countries in the alliance now stands at 30. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has been in Kyiv today as the first foreign minister on the UN security council to visit Ukraine since the latest Russian invasion of the country began on 24 February. After visiting areas in the capital directly affected by the invasion, and meeting Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, he said the killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces is likely to be a war crime. Speaking during a press conference with Kuleba, Coveney said it was a privilege to be with him, and said he brought a strong message of solidarity from the Irish government and people. PA Media quote him saying: We don’t know yet how many citizens have lost their lives due to this Russian aggression but we know it is many, and the brutality and violence, not only against soldiers, but against Ukrainian civilians is something that is likely to be determined as war crimes in the future. I am also conscious at this time that Ukraine does not want sympathy, it needs action and strong practical support in defending yourselves, and even though Ireland is militarily neutral, let me be clear we are not neutral on this war and conflict and the future of your country. We know Ukrainians dream of a different type of future, one that is based on democracy, stability and economic opportunity, and we believe those things can be achieved through full EU membership and Ireland will advocate that it happens as rapidly as possible. We believe that the most powerful countries in the world are accountable to international law and the atrocities against Ukraine citizens need to be part of a process to ensure full accountability. Russia’s investigative committee has said that Ukrainian forces carried out at least six helicopter airstrikes on the village of Klimovo in the Russian region of Bryansk, injuring seven people. The Bryansk region governor said earlier that two residential buildings in the village had been hit by shelling, which is north of the Ukrainian region of Chernihiv. Additionally, a village in Russia’s Belgorod region had come under fire from Ukraine, the region’s governor said. “The village of Spodaryushino has been subjected to fire from Ukraine,” the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a post on the Telegram messaging service. He said no one had been injured and that the village and one other settlement had been evacuated. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s defence ministry and military did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier this month, Russia claimed that Ukraine sent attack helicopters across the border to strike an oil storage facility in the Russian region of Belgorod, which borders Kharkiv to the north-east of Ukraine. At the time, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, denied Ukrainian responsibility for the attack. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, is the latest to add his voice to warnings from Russia that it will take security measures if Sweden and Finland opt to join Nato. Reuters reports that Grushko said their membership of the military alliance would lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has responded to the rhetoric coming out of Russia today over possible Nato expansion, saying that “Sweden and Finland are free to choose their future without interference – the UK will support whatever they decide.” This is Martin Belam back here on the live blog for an hour – you can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 30 Ukrainian prisoners of war were being returned as part of an exchange with Russia, AFP reports. In a statement, Vereshchuk said: Five officers and 17 servicemen were exchanged. Also eight civilians, including one woman, were released. In total, 30 of our citizens are going home today. Earlier, the Ukrainian defence ministry said two military pilots, Ivan Pepelyashko and Oleksiy Chyzh, who had been captured in Ukraine’s Chernigiv region and held in Russia, had been released. It was not immediately clear whether the pilots were part of the exchange announced by Vereshchuk. The statement by the defence ministry cited Chyzh as saying that both men were subjected to hostile interrogations and denied medical treatment while in captivity. It quoted him as saying: We were forced to record propaganda videos. If we refused, they threatened to stop bandaging our comrades’ wounds. The Kremlin said the condition for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy is a document ready for the two leaders to sign. In his daily press briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied that the Russian president had refused to meet his Ukrainian counterpart. Peskov said: The president has never refused such a meeting, but appropriate conditions should be prepared for it, namely the text of the document. The US cannot confirm yet what happened to the Russian warship Moskva because it does not have enough information, the Pentagon’s press secretary, John Kirby, said. In an interview with MSNBC, Kirby said: We don’t know what caused that explosion. We’ve seen the social media reports that this was maybe a Ukrainian coastal defence missile (that) hit it. We can’t rule that out, we just don’t have enough information right now. The Guardian’s Luke Harding visited three ravaged towns close to Kyiv and spoke to residents about the devastation they experienced after Russian forces invaded. One woman, Natasha, recounted the savage murder of her nephew, who she said was shot in the head by soldiers. Harding travelled to the “garden towns” of Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka, where people had lived peaceful, suburban lives until the invasion. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has appealed to the United Nations to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been “illegally deported” to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had engaged in the “illegal and forced displacement” of Ukrainian children, “among them orphans, children deprived of parental care, as well as children whose parents died as a result of Russia’s military aggression” across Ukraine’s borders to Russia. The statement reads: In violation of international humanitarian law and basic standards of humanness, Russia is engaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation. Such actions of the Russian occupiers can be qualified as kidnapping and require a decisive reaction from the international community, primarily from the relevant international organizations. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russian forces of forcibly deporting thousands of children from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine since the war began. Earlier this month, two individuals said they and other women and children were forcibly transported to Russian territory from the besieged city of Mariupol in March. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has denied these accusations, claiming “such reports are lies”. Displaced Ukrainian students in Scotland will be given tuition and living cost support, under proposals from the Scottish government subject to parliamentary approval. The scheme would mean Ukrainians starting a further or higher education course this autumn will be eligible for the support if they have submitted an application through the UK’s homes for Ukraine, Ukraine family or Ukraine extension schemes. Jamie Hepburn, Scotland’s minister for higher and further education, said: By extending home fee status and living cost support to students arriving from Ukraine we hope to provide some stability and assurance at this deeply troubling time and ensure those forced to flee their homes can live safely and comfortably in Scotland for as long as they need to. Eligible university students would be able to receive free tuition and living cost support of up to £8,100 a year in bursaries and loans, and students entering further education for bursary and grants of up to £4,668 a year. Russia’s defence ministry has said the fire on board the warship Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, is “under control”. The ship was reportedly struck by two Ukrainian missiles in the Black Sea late on Wednesday night. It was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said: The fire on the cruiser Moskva is under control. There are no flames visible. Ammunition supplies are no longer exploding. The cruiser Moskva is still afloat. The main missile armoury has not been damaged. The crew of the cruiser were evacuated to Black Sea Fleet vessels nearby. Measures are being taken to tow the cruiser into port. The causes of the fire are currently being established. The ministry had earlier said that the ship had been “seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire”. However, Ukraine’s southern military command said the Moska had started to sink after it was hit by a Neptune missile. In a Facebook post, the southern military command said the missile cruiser had received “significant damage” and a fire ignited on board after the strike. The statement continued: Other units of the ship’s group tried to help, but a storm and a powerful explosion of ammunition overturned the cruiser and it began to sink. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here. I’ll be bringing you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The Russian defence ministry said the entire crew of the warship Moskva had been evacuated late on Wednesday night after an ammunition explosion and fire on the ship. However, the governor of the Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said the Ukrainians had struck the Moskva with two Neptune missiles. The ship was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war, and is the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. The defence ministry said it would be towed back to port. Russia has warned Nato that if Finland and Sweden were to join the military alliance, then it would take measures in the Baltic. Dmitry Medvedev said: “There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored.” Finland and Sweden took a major step towards joining Nato yesterday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, has dismissed the earlier words of Medvedev threatening as “nothing new”. Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anusauskas said that Russia had always kept nuclear weapons in its exclave Kaliningrad anyway. Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was opening criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts. The governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region said four civilians had been killed and 10 wounded during Russian shelling of the city of on Thursday. Ukrainian forces claim they sabotaged a bridge as a Russian military convoy was crossing it towards Izyum in the Kharkiv region, destroying the convoy. Iryna Vereshchuk, one of Ukraine’s deputy prime ministers, has announced that today there will be nine humanitarian corridors available. Civilians would need to use private cars to escape from the besieged city of Mariupol. Other evacuation routes are from Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar, and the ones in the eastern Luhansk region will only operate if occupying Russian forces stop their shelling. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for an oil embargo in his nightly address on Wednesday. “First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, who has been part of the negotiating team at the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, has said a stumbling block is that Ukraine wants as many countries as possible to act as security guarantors, but Russia does not want their number to increase. The US president, Joe Biden, earlier announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has warned that “The towns of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka are likely to be Russian targets for similar levels of violence” as the urban shelling seen elsewhere as Russian military operations focus to the east. The UK government has announced that about 16,400 people have arrived in the UK from Ukraine under the two visa schemes the Home Office has set up to handle refugees. The UNHCR estimates the number of people who have fled Ukraine for abroad since Russia’s latest invasion began on 24 February is 4,697,964. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be with you again later on today. In the meantime, I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong. The governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Oleh Synyegubov, said four civilians had been killed and 10 wounded during Russian shelling of the city on Thursday. Reuters reports that in a statement, the Kharkiv region governor also urged residents of some towns to evacuate since he said military operations were expected to take place in the area. The claims have not been independently verified. The UK government has announced that about 16,400 people have arrived in the UK from Ukraine under the two visa schemes the Home Office has set up to handle refugees. The UNHCR estimates the number of people who have fled Ukraine for abroad since Russia’s latest invasion began on 24 February is 4,697,964 Here is a selection of some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine: Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Šimonytė, has dismissed the earlier words of Dmitry Medvedev threatening Nato over the possibility of Finland and Sweden joining as “nothing new”. [see 8.42am] Reuters report she told the media “That Russia threatens, it is nothing new. Kaliningrad is a very militarized zone, has been for many years, and it is in the Baltic region.” The BNS agency quotes her being strongly supportive of the potential moves for Sweden and Finland to join the alliance, saying: I believe that the presence of these countries as members of the alliance would, in fact, greatly strengthen both the Alliance and these countries and our security. As soon as such a decision is announced, I hope it will be, I think that the Baltic countries will have a very serious reason to welcome it. Medvedev said if the two nations were to join Nato, there could be “no more talk” of a nuclear-free Baltic. However, Lithuania’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, has suggested this is meaningless. In Vilnius he told BNS that nuclear weapons have been deployed in Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea since before the current crisis. The current Russian threats look quite strange, when we know that, even without the present security situation, they keep the weapon 100km from Lithuania’s border. Nuclear weapons have always been kept in Kaliningrad. The international community, the countries in the region, are perfectly aware of this. They use it as a threat. Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave, on the shore of the Baltic Sea, is sandwiched between existing Nato members Lithuania and Poland. Šimonytė visited Ukraine on Monday to see the impact of Russian action in the country. Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was opening criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen’s alleged torture of their Russian counterparts. The committee, which probes major crimes, said some Russian soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces in the Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions and held illegally by Ukraine’s security service. “Russians were subjected to physical violence and torture in order to force them to give false explanations about the actual conditions of their illegal detention on the premises of the security service of Ukraine, as well as on (Russia’s) special military operation,” Reuters reports it said in a statement. Reuters could not independently verify the committee’s allegations. Ukraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. He is considered an expert in chemical and biological weapons and is a visiting fellow at Magdalene College in Cambridge. On the unproven allegations this week that Russia had used a chemical weapon in Mariupol, he said: There is a strong possibility that actually what happened was a release of toxic industrial chemicals. I know the Ukrainian government were very concerned about the steelworks in Mariupol where the fighting is going on. And stored there is a lot of toxic chemicals like chlorine and ammonia. If that was attacked, and blew up, that could deliver those toxic chemicals and some of the symptoms we’re seeing would be respiratory symptoms from something like chlorine or ammonia. This stuff is very non-persistent and disappears very quickly. However, he had a warning about potential future use of more deliberate chemical agents, saying: Over time, the Russians have used chemical weapons. I’m talking to you from Salisbury, where of course there was the major Russian nerve agent attack four years ago. And we saw the Syrian regime using chemical weapons frequently in Syria, which are morbidly brilliant weapons. If you have no morals or scruples, you would use them. The four-year siege of Aleppo, which is not dissimilar to Mariupol, was broken with 13 days of chlorine barrel bombs. So that that is a huge concern. He also said: With all the forces massing in the Donbas for what looks like to be a massive battle coming up, if the Russians get stuck – which I think they will do – and they in effect have been defeated in the north. If they’re held and defeated in the Donbas, then God knows what sort of weapons that will go to. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Earlier this week the Russian embassy in the US said that the country had destroyed all of its stockpiles of chemical weapons in 2017. Russia has warned Nato that if Finland and Sweden were to join the military alliance, then it would take measures in the Baltic. Dmitry Medvedev is reported by Reuters saying: “There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored. Until today, Russia has not taken such measures and was not going to.” Medvedev has been deputy chairman of the security council of Russia since 2020. He has previously been president and prime minister of Russia, and is a long-term ally of Vladimir Putin. Finland and Sweden took a major step towards joining Nato yesterday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. J Oliver Conroy writes for us this morning about his experience joining four Americans who dropped everything to travel across the world and risk their lives defending Ukraine: A month earlier Tay was home in Dallas, Texas, watching videos about the Russian invasion, when he saw the president of Ukraine addressing the world. “To all the friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “come. We will give you weapons.” Tay served with the 82nd Airborne in Ghazni province, Afghanistan. He marched in front of armored vehicles, sweeping for mines, and guarded against enemy motorcyclists. His unit was under constant IED attack. After he began to have seizures, he was honorably discharged and labeled “disabled”, a classification he accepted out of economic necessity but resented. With prolonged treatment, the seizures mostly went away, but not before he went through a bad spell. His marriage ended; he got in fights and trouble with the law. He spent years pulling himself out of the hole. He “unchubbied” himself, after so much time spent fat and depressed. He found work as a private investigator and later in underwater construction, building docks for rich people. He had partly succeeded at his project of personal reconstruction when he started to see pictures of Ukrainian civilians making molotov cocktails, and bombed-out maternity hospitals, and Zelenskiy in his olive-green zip-up. That’s when he contacted his congressman’s office, which agreed to secure him an emergency passport after he found a Ukrainian NGO to vouch for him. He began packing, and bought a one-way flight. When he broke the decision to his friends and family, “the reaction was terrible”. They were distraught that he would walk away from his civilian life, from his nice high-rise apartment, to fight and possibly die for Ukraine. They did not understand, he says, that this was a way to be useful in the best way he knew how – that this was a chance to make himself right. Read more of J Oliver Conroy’s piece here: Among the Americans fighting in Ukraine: ‘I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t come’ The UK’s ministry of defence has issued its latest public assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine. In it they warn that as Russian president, Vladimir Putin continues to show interest in the east of Ukraine: Urban centres have faced repeated indiscriminate attacks from Russia throughout the conflict. The towns of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka are likely to be Russian targets for similar levels of violence. The UK’s MoD also suggested that the Ukrainian resistence in Mariupol was still tying up significant Russian resources. Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, who has been part of the negotiating team at the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, has spoken on television in Ukraine about one of the stumbling blocks in the way of talks – the number of countries that would act as security guarantors. Reuters report he said Ukraine wants as many countries as possible to act as security guarantors, but Russia does not want their number to increase. Russia has previously indicated that Belarus should be one of the countries that guarantees security, while Turkey has repeatedly offered to play a mediating role between its Black Sea neighbours. Tobias Ellwood is a Conservative MP in the UK, and chair of the Commons defence committee in parliament. He has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “the world has changed beyond recognition” as a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine. PA Media quotes him saying: We need to craft a fresh 10-year strategy about how to handle Russia and China’s aggression. The world has changed beyond recognition. We’ve had 30 years of peace, that is now over, and there needs to be this wider, bigger debate to be held, a Casablanca-type conference, as we saw in the Second World War. The Casablanca conference was held in 1943, and was attended by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the leaders of the Free French Forces Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud among others. Over ten days they determined the Allied strategy for the rest of the second world war, committing to a doctrine of forcing Germany and the Axis powers into “unconditional surrender”. Here is the latest analysis from our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh, asking are Russia’s weapons of choice getting worse?: Moscow’s forces have been repeatedly accused of using indiscriminate weapons in cities throughout the seven-week-long Ukraine war, a disregard for civilian life that has already almost certainly led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. A preliminary war crimes assessment, conducted on behalf of 45 members of the OSCE, concluded that Russia had engaged in “a clear pattern” of war crimes, targeting, for example, hospitals, schools and places of shelter during the seven weeks of fighting. At its simplest level, Russia is accused of using unguided bombs – heavy artillery, Grad multiple rockets, air dropped bombs – on urban areas by the OSCE monitors. “A majority of Russian attacks in populated areas have been conducted with unguided artillery,” was their grim conclusion in a 99-page report. It is a war crime to target civilians directly, and to engage in an attack on a military target that is expected to cause a loss of civilian life excessive in relation to the battlefield gain – regardless of the weapons used. Film shot by the Associated Press in Mariupol last month, for instance, shows a Russian tank shooting at an apartment block from some distance. In that city, scene of the worst urban fighting in the war so far, the office of the UN’s human rights commissioner has already concluded “126 multi-story residential buildings were damaged and 65 were destroyed”. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s analysis here: As Russia continues to bomb Ukraine, are its weapons of choice getting worse? Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, has announced that today there will be nine humanitarian corridors available to evacuate civilians from areas in Ukraine under attack by Russia. Reuters reports she said civilians would need to use private cars to escaped from the besieged city of Mariupol. Other evacuation routes are from Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar, and the ones in the eastern Luhansk region will only operate if occupying Russian forces stop their shelling. There were no corridors set up yesterday, in part, she had said, because Russia was unable to control its forces on the ground and observe agreed local ceasefires while people were fleeing. The claims were not independently verified. The 5 Kanal news service in Ukraine is carrying a little more detail on Ukrainian claims it sabotaged a bridge as a Russian military convoy was crossing it. They report Ukraine’s armed forces stopped the advance of military equipment towards Izyum, a town that is in the east of Ukraine. A military statement posted to Facebook has described the ambush, saying: Having established the route of the enemy column, the SSO operators of Ukraine surveyed the facility that was most suitable for an engineering ambush. It was a bridge on the path of enemy equipment. Then - painstaking professional work: determining the location of charges, calculating the required amount of TNT equivalent. explosives to a designated place, SSO operators of Ukraine were waiting for the enemy, who unsuspectingly went to meet death. The claims have not been verified independently. This is Martin Belam in London taking over the blog from my colleague Samantha Lock. I will be here for the next few hours, and you can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Almost 6,500 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office has said. A total of 6,492 cases have been reported and 197 children have been confirmed to have been killed, the office added. Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy called for an oil embargo in his latest national address. First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Zelenskiy added that he discussed western sanctions policy with a group of international and Ukrainian experts who “assessed the sanctions imposed and how Russia is trying to circumvent them”. The group has prepared concrete proposals on how to remove sanctions loopholes and how to immediately enhance sanctions to make it tangible for Moscow, Zelenskiy added. Ukrainian troops have blown up a bridge carrying Russian forces heading to Izyum, a city on the Donets river in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, the military has said. An entire column of Russian troops was reportedly destroyed in an operation using a UAV drone. Russian troops are stepping up activity in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. They are trying to retaliate for their defeats. Rocket bombings and artillery strikes continue. New columns of equipment are being brought in. They are looking for reserves. They are trying to recruit residents of the south of our country - that is, from these temporarily occupied areas in addition to the so-called mobilisation in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.” However, Zelenskiy noted that the recent “feverish activity” of Russian forces reflects Russia’s insecurity and inability to defeat Ukraine. Even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers, whom the commanders do not spare at all, the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. Well, we do everything to justify their doubts.” “This war against Ukraine can only end in Russia’s strategic defeat - sooner or later,” he added. Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever.” Russia is attempting to mobilise up to 70,000 people in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian military claims. It has been established that the Russian command has assigned the task of mobilising 60-70,000 people in the territory of the so-called ‘DPR’,” the general staff of the armed forces said in its latest morning operational report, adding that the specified figures were completed “by only 20%”. Russian forces continue to expand units near the eastern border and restore and replenish ammunition, officials added. Ukrainian troops thwarted eight Russian attacks over the past 24 hours in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the report read. As many as 300 people were taken by Russian forces as hostages for four weeks in the basement of a school in Yahidne north of Chernihiv, Ukraine’s ministry of defence has claimed. The hostages allegedly kept track of the days they were held on a wall. The names of 18 people alleged to have been killed or died in the conditions were also found written on the wall, Ukrainian officials said. Reuters previously spoke to seven residents of Yahidne who said that, in total, at least 20 people died or were killed during the Russian occupation. No official death toll has been released by Ukrainian authorities. Negotiations are reportedly underway on the exchange of 169 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who were taken prisoner at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials say. The ministry made the announcement in an update on the Telegram messaging app, citing Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky. Chernobyl is a tragic page in our history. Unfortunately, we have to state that 169 servicemen of the National Guard were taken prisoner there. Today, some of them, according to our information, are in the territory of the Republic of Belarus, some - in Russia. We were at the place where they were kept. This is a dungeon without light, without the ability to communicate properly. They were deprived of all means of communication while they were there. And then they were taken out. Unfortunately, I can’t say what their fate is. Negotiations are underway to exchange them. But we understand that this will probably be only after the end of the active phase of hostilities.” Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. A 12-year-old boy holds a cat standing on the debris of his house destroyed by Russian forces’ shelling in the outskirts of Chernihiv, Ukraine. His mother, Liudmila Koval, had to have her leg amputated and was injured in her abdomen after shelling. She is still waiting for proper medical treatment, the Associated Press reports. Chernihiv, a northern Ukrainian city, has been besieged by Russian forces. Shells and bombs that rained down on the city for weeks have reduced its buildings and neighbourhoods to rubble. US President Joe Biden earlier announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5 billion, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armoured personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defence boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armoured personnel carriers.” Biden said he had also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, saying equipment provided to Ukraine “has been critical” as it confronts the invasion. “We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskiy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,” Biden said. The new package includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters and 18 155mm howitzers, along with 40,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, 200 armoured personnel carriers and 300 additional Switchblade drones. It will be the first time howitzers have been provided to Ukraine by the United States. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said some of the systems, like the howitzers and radars, will require additional training for Ukrainian forces not accustomed to using American military equipment. “We’re aware of the clock and we know time is not our friend,” Kirby said when asked about the speed of deliveries. The Russian defence ministry said the entire crew of the warship Moskva, reported to be struck by two Ukrainian missiles in the Black Sea late on Wednesday night, has been evacuated after an ammunition explosion and fire on the ship. The ship was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea fleet. “The cruiser ‘Moskva’ of the Black Sea Fleet was seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire, the crew was evacuated,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the Russian defene ministry. “As a result of a fire, ammunition detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,” the ministry added. Earlier this evening, Ukraine said it struck and damaged a Russian warship in the Black Sea, according to a Telegram messaged posted by Odesa governor Maksym Marchenko. “Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage to the Russian ship. Glory to Ukraine!” Marchenko’s message read. “It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!” On the first day of the invasion, the small garrison refused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to “go fuck yourself”. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said the 12,500 tonne ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Russian news agencies said the Moskva was armed with 16 anti-ship ‘Vulkan’ cruise missiles, which have a range of at least 700km (440 miles). Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments before my colleague Martin Belam takes the reigns a little later on. Here is where the situation currently stands: The Russian defence ministry has said the entire crew of the warship Moskva, reported to be struck by Ukraine in the Black Sea late on Wednesday, has been evacuated after an ammunition explosion resulted in a fire on the ship. “The cruiser Moskva of the Black Sea Fleet was seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire, the crew was evacuated,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the Russian defence ministry. The ship was defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500-tonne ship has a crew of about 500. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an oil embargo in his nightly address on Wednesday. “First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Zelenskiy confirmed forensic experts from the international criminal court visited Bucha on Wednesday to investigate possible war crimes. “Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha.” International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, told reporters “Ukraine is a crime scene” after visiting Bucha on Wednesday. US president Joe Biden announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5bn, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armoured personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defence boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Zelenskiy. The US state department on Wednesday defended Biden’s charge that Russia is carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, saying its forces are trying to destroy the country and its civilian population. Biden levelled the accusation at president Vladimir Putin’s forces for the first time on Tuesday, saying it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. US state department official, Victoria Nuland, told CNN: “I am going to predict that what president Biden called it is what we will ultimately likely find when we are able to gather all of this evidence. Because what is happening on the ground is not an accident.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, declined to repeat Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. Zelenskiy responded: “Such things are very painful for us, so I will definitely do my best to discuss this issue with him.” More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. Negotiations are reportedly underway on the exchange of 169 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who were taken prisoner at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs said. The presidents of four countries bordering Russia – Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – travelled to Kyiv in a show of support for their Ukrainian counterpart and his embattled troops. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. Senior US officials are weighing whether to send a top Cabinet level official to Kyiv as a high profile representative in a show of solidarity with Ukraine, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. Zelenskiy also warned that the war will become an “endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction” without additional weaponry. In a speech at the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that countries on the fence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine could face global isolation. “The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin said that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all. The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. Australia has also imposed targeted financial sanctions on 14 Russian state-owned enterprises on Thursday, including defence-related entities such as truckmaker Kamaz, and shipping companies SEVMASH and United Shipbuilding Corp. A Russian court ordered an artist to be held behind bars for allegedly replacing supermarket price labels with messages protesting against Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Russia is imposing sanctions on 398 US House representatives and 87 Canadiana senators, Interfax news agency reported. The European Space Agency said is has ended cooperation with Russia on three missions to the Moon due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, following a previous decision to do the same for a Mars mission. Russia will seek peace or leave the international arena forever, Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. “Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever.” UN chief, Antonio Guterres, said that a ceasefire in Ukraine “doesn’t seem possible,” possibly indicating that the UN is still waiting on a response from Russia on evacuating Ukrainian civilians and providing aid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T11:30:51Z","webTitle":"Britain’s nuclear U-turn puts us in a very lonely club | Fred Pearce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/government-nuclear-dream-north-wales-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s nuclear U-turn puts us in a very lonely club","bodyText":"For once, ministers have put their money where their mouth is – into taking another stab at nuclear power. This week the business secretary, Greg Clark, announced plans to pump £5bn into a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in north Wales. It was a reversal of a longstanding Conservative policy not to underwrite nuclear construction. So why the sudden enthusiasm? And what does Clark know that the rest of the world does not? For almost everywhere else, governments and corporations are pulling the plug on nuclear. Even in a world fearful of climate change, in which nations have promised to wean themselves off fossil fuels by the mid-century, almost no one wants to touch nuclear. Germany will be nuclear-free by 2022. France – once Europe’s great nuclear advocates – is backtracking. President Macron is committed to cutting nuclear’s contribution to grid power from the 75% to 50%. Seven years after the Fukushima accident, all but a handful of Japan’s 54 nuclear power plants remain closed. US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors. Meanwhile, the state-sponsored nuclear enthusiasm of China, recently the world’s premier builder, has dimmed. Beijing has issued no new construction approvals for over two years. Only Russia keeps up the momentum – which puts Britain in an embarrassing club. Britain hasn’t completed a new nuclear power station for 23 years. The government’s professed reason for its newfound enthusiasm is fighting climate change, and in particular the need to find replacements on the grid for the remaining coal-fired power plants that it has pledged to shut by 2025. But while the cause is correct, the solution is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world. Yes, nuclear is a proven large-scale source of low-carbon electricity. But renewable sources like solar and wind are both now cheaper, and are becoming cheaper still, while nuclear costs only rise. Some who call themselves “eco-modernists” argue that nuclear and renewables would make a great mix: nuclear could fill in when the sun goes down and the winds drop. But there is a problem. Any effective stand-in for fickle renewables needs to be available at the flick of a switch. Hydropower or natural gas can do the job, but not nuclear. Its forte is to deliver constant baseload power. If nuclear ticked enough other boxes, it might still have a role to play in keeping the lights on. But it has always been a bad neighbour and troublesome citizen. Some of our fears about radiation may be exaggerated, but they are real fears nonetheless. And nuclear power’s links to nuclear weapons are not just about shared technology – at least not while Britain remains home to the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium. We are sitting on 130 tonnes of a human-made element that lies at the heart of most nuclear weapons. The stockpile is at a warehouse at Sellafield in Cumbria, in defiance of warnings from scientists at the Royal Society a decade ago that in its present form it poses a major security risk, whether diverted for weapons or breached by terrorists. The plutonium was manufactured over decades from used power-station reactor fuel. Britain wanted to be at the forefront of a new global industry using plutonium to fuel new designs of reactors. But production continues even though there is no sign of a world market for plutonium. And neither the new Hinkley Point reactor under construction in Somerset, nor the proposed plant at Wylfa, will burn the stuff. The government seems determined to pursue a nuclear dream, even though it has palpably failed to come to terms with the toxic legacy of the country’s nuclear past. Next to the site of the planned Wylfa plant sits the shell of an old nuclear power station. It was shut in 2015, but is not scheduled for demolition for almost another century, in 2105. It is one of 11 former plants that sit abandoned around our coastlines, from Dungeness in Kent to Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia, and Sizewell in Suffolk to Hunterston in south-west Scotland. They are currently being put into what the industry terms “care and maintenance” – mothballed while their radioactivity decays, and until the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority can find somewhere to put their remains. On present form, that day may never come. Britain is today no nearer agreeing a final resting place for its most dangerous and long-lasting radioactive wastes than it was back in 1976, when the royal commission on environmental pollution said we should build no more nuclear power plants until that problem was resolved. Absurdly, the most recent plan has been to bury the waste in tunnels to be dug beneath the Lake District national park. Nuclear power today is a largely friendless industry: uneconomic without heavy government support, uninsurable, stuck with a military heritage from hell, overtaken by cleaner competitors, beset by waste problems that no one has resolved, and always vulnerable to public panic after the Chernobyl or Fukushima accidents. Some believe it may have a future when the waste problems are resolved and if radical new reactor designs emerge. That may be so. But the truth is that in the 60 years since the bomb-makers first promised us “atoms for peace”, nuclear power has gone from a sunrise to a sunset industry. Only the British government seems not to realise it. • Fred Pearce is the author of Fallout: A Journey Through the Nuclear Age, From the Atom Bomb to Radioactive Waste"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/15/concerns-eu-bank-balks-plans-halt-fossil-fuel-investments-climate-action-eib","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-15T14:09:39Z","webTitle":"Concerns as EU bank balks at plan to halt fossil fuel investments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/15/concerns-eu-bank-balks-plans-halt-fossil-fuel-investments-climate-action-eib","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/15/concerns-eu-bank-balks-plans-halt-fossil-fuel-investments-climate-action-eib","fields":{"headline":"Concerns as EU bank balks at plan to halt fossil fuel investments","bodyText":"The European Investment Bank (EIB) has balked at a proposal to halt new investments in fossil fuels, raising concerns that Germany and other nations are plotting to water down what would be one of the financial sector’s most ambitious climate moves. The EIB, the largest public bank in the world, announced this year that it would end lending to new gas projects, having already curtailed funding for coal and oil. This would free up more money for renewable energy developments. The details of the plan were expected to be confirmed by a board meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday but last-minute lobbying has forced a postponement. Executives of the bank, which is owned by EU member states, said the plan was still on course and would probably be approved next month. “The new energy lending policy is a milestone on the EIB’s road to transform itself into the EU Climate Bank. I am pleased about the important progress made today and am confident of securing a final approval in November,” said Andrew McDowell, the EIB vice-president responsible for energy. But climate campaigners fear the measures will be delayed further and weakened. “This delay is a direct result of Germany and the European commission pushing to add more fossil fuels back into the policy. This is the opposite of the leadership demanded by millions of climate strikers and activists around the world,” said Alex Doukas of the NGO Oil Change International. “We are in the middle of a climate emergency, so it shouldn’t be hard to say no to more public money for fossil fuels.” Between 2013-17, the EIB provided almost €12bn (£10.4bn) in loans to fossil fuel projects, almost all for gas. Supporters of the gas industry argue it is a “transition” fuel that reduces demand for higher-carbon oil and coal while providing energy security. Climate campaigners say gas projects release high levels of methane, which has a far greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide, and that they will delay the transition to zero-carbon renewables such as wind and solar power. The EIB says it has provided more than €65bn of new financing for renewable energy projects, but the bank’s president, Werner Hoyer, has called for more urgency. “We believe that gas emissions are too high and cannot be maintained. We must move out of these fossil fuels. We are aware it takes a transition period. We are aware that it takes help for the regions that are dependent on coal and gas. But one should not hide behind these arguments in order to perpetuate the use of these types of materials,” he said in a recent interview. EU leaders plan to describe global heating as an “existential threat”, according to a leaked copy of a summit communique, but there are divisions over the speed of action. Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050. Germany reportedly believes gas is necessary for energy security, at least on an interim basis as it moves away from coal and nuclear power. The clamour for urgent action is increasingly loud, spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, student climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion protesters and influential establishment voices such as David Attenborough and the Church of England. Scientists warned last year there was little over a decade to transform energy systems if the world was to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level. Yet the world of finance continues to move in the opposite direction, particularly in the private sector. In a weeklong investigation, the Guardian revealed the world’s largest investment banks and asset management companies had aggressively expanded into new coal, oil and gas projects since the 2016 Paris climate agreement. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned that many of these assets will be left stranded, leading to bankruptcies and a growing risk of a global financial crash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2019/dec/10/hong-kong-china-the-life-and-death-of-a-journalist","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-10T07:28:55Z","webTitle":"Hong Kong reporters inspired The Life and Death of a Journalist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/10/hong-kong-china-the-life-and-death-of-a-journalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2019/dec/10/hong-kong-china-the-life-and-death-of-a-journalist","fields":{"headline":"Hong Kong reporters inspired The Life and Death of a Journalist","bodyText":"I never planned to write a play about Hong Kong, the place of my birth, nor China, the place of my father’s birth. My father was a pro-democracy politician, journalist and historian; my gradual uncovering of his work has since seeped into my own practice as a theatre-maker. Since 1997, Beijing has gradually tightened its grip on Hong Kong’s semi-autonomy. Following the umbrella revolution in 2014, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) swiftly accelerated its encroachment on civil liberties and freedom of speech. Journalists have bravely challenged China’s rise to global power off the back of millions who are persecuted and oppressed on a daily basis. Over little more than half a decade, western governments have kowtowed in droves to a state that punishes those who express opposing views. The UK has allowed China to build instrumental technological infrastructure and to own shares in its nuclear power, the public water supply and rail services. China, which, among a long checklist of violations to human rights, is currently imprisoning at least one million people in the Xinjiang region – largely Muslim Uighurs. One of the biggest leaks in history was made by the media this year and exposed the truth behind these camps. These China cables make for a harrowing read, and clearly contest Beijing’s claim that these camps are for “re-education” and to combat terrorism. Over the past six months, Hong Kong has witnessed one of the most harrowing and brutal episodes of violence in its history. It began with protesters peacefully marching against the controversial extradition bill. But the city has become a dystopian battleground where molotov cocktails are used by young protesters as defence against riot police’s rubber bullets. Ordinary citizens are teargassed on the street in a disproportionate use of force. Hong Kong confirmed it entered a recession, the first in a decade. Hong Kong university campuses transformed into war zones. The siege in Polytechnic University finally came to a close, while students were arrested trying to escape or surrendered themselves to the police. The same week, Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act – passed almost unanimously by Congress – which sent a strong message to Beijing of the US support for Hong Kong’s freedoms. Here in Britain, which has continued to do nothing for its former colonial outpost, it’s a different story. Last year, Chinese state-controlled network CGTN opened its first European hub in west London. Within months, the channel became subject to investigation by Ofcom after claims that it had been biased in its coverage. The channel even went so far as to hire a neutral consultant, former head of Sky News Nick Pollard, but he resigned from his post due to concerns over its Hong Kong coverage. Recently, former British consulate worker Simon Cheng, who was arrested at the Chinese border and alleges that he was detained and tortured for two weeks, made a complaint against the network for airing what he says was a forced confession. For almost a decade, I have written about similar topics as a journalist. But I never explicitly transposed my biggest frustrations into a dramatic work, fearful of the possible repercussions for my family. I was hesitant to write a work that could be seen as a one-sided polemic, a personal echo chamber, the worst kind of drama. But, inevitably, these interlocking entities – journalism and China – became impossible to ignore. I wrote the first draft of this play in less than a week. Into it I injected my frustration, despair, curiosity, fear and admiration for the industry, but also a great respect for its reporters who continue to face moral and ethical dilemmas. The play looks at the more troubling aspects of the job for womenwho face unimaginable challenges on the ground, in the office and at home. Journalism does not only report the facts, but provides vital context. It can also spark debate, entertain, uncover prejudices and lead to the breakup of relationships. Similarly, theatre can hold a mirror up to society, albeit a distorted one, dramatising that context in an attempt to engage, entertain and, occasionally, provide uncomfortable catharsis. Whether or not you agree with what is published or staged, would you rather the two mediums did not exist? My play follows a female journalist who chooses to align herself with a pro-CCP outlet because of her misplaced belief that she can change it from the inside. This play is partly an appeal for Britain and the rest of the world to reflect on the consequences of welcoming an authoritarian propaganda outlet with open arms. It uses the media as a backdrop and a battleground to ask: whose side are you on?

Shares in Britain’s biggest energy company dropped more than 10% after the company lowered its cashflow outlook for 2019, leading investors to fear Centrica’s dividend could be cut. Iain Conn, the chief executive, said the group faced a “huge number of headwinds”, including the price cap, reduced gasfield production and several of its nuclear power plants being offline. The company lost 742,000 of its 25 million household energy customers last year, although the figure is about half the losses in 2017. While the group’s profits were up 12% in 2018 to £1.39bn, its home energy unit profits fell 18% to £668m. Conn said customer numbers had remained stable in 2019 so far. He was strongly critical of the cap, which he said had been set at a level that was stopping companies investing. “The problem is it’s temporary and it doesn’t fix the market. We think it’s the wrong intervention but obviously it’s here and we’ll live with it,” he said. Even with energy regulator, Ofgem, lifting the cap in April, Centrica said it would lose £300m this year because of the measure. The firm has launched a legal challenge against a one-off £70m portion of that £300m total. Centrica plans to cut and sell its way out of what it called a “challenging external backdrop”. The firm has already cut 7,700 jobs since 2015 and plans to cut another 1,500-2,000 this year. On Thursday it announced a further £500m of cuts beyond 2019. However, the firm refused to lay out the impact on jobs because it said overheads were falling as customers moved to managing their accounts online rather than on the phone. An earlier £500m cut resulted in the loss of more than 4,000 jobs. The company said it had sold Clockwork, the US home services arm it bought in 2010, for £230m, which Conn called a “good deal”. Centrica is also trying to sell its 20% stake in the UK’s eight nuclear power plants but would only say the sale was progressing as planned. “We’ve had expressions of interest from a number of parties,” Conn said. The firm’s difficulties in home energy supply, nuclear power and gas production led to it revising down its outlook for adjusted operating cashflow to £1.8bn-2bn, below a previous target of £2.1bn-2.3bn for 2018-2020. Conn said no decision had been made on dividends for shareholders. “The cash flow target is under some pressure and therefore people could conclude the dividend is under pressure … [but] I do not think you should automatically conclude there is a dividend cut coming.” However, analysts said they would not be surprised if a dividend cut was imminent. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The dividend is starting to creak. It’s been held at 12p this year but Centrica is increasingly relying on cost-cutting and disposals to prop up the payment. Neither can continue forever.” SSE, the second biggest energy supplier, said on Thursday that it was raising prices by 10% for millions of its customers on default tariffs. All of the big six energy suppliers have now set their default tariffs at the exact level of the cap from 1 April, £1,254."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/09/australia-politics-live-albanese-india-robodebt-voice-cost-of-living-climate-interest-rates-weather-health-nsw-qld-vic","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T08:01:07Z","webTitle":"Robodebt inquiry analysis shows majority of victims women – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/09/australia-politics-live-albanese-india-robodebt-voice-cost-of-living-climate-interest-rates-weather-health-nsw-qld-vic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/09/australia-politics-live-albanese-india-robodebt-voice-cost-of-living-climate-interest-rates-weather-health-nsw-qld-vic","fields":{"headline":"Robodebt inquiry analysis shows majority of victims women – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening.

Hundreds of University of Sydney staff and students continued their strike for a seventh day, marking the longest-running campaign of work stoppages at an Australian university. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the government would continue to work with Senator David Pocock and others on the crossbench to work through the safeguard mechanism deadlock. Home values fell at a record 12-month pace but the decline is slowing, CoreLogic said. It came as the National Australia Bank became the first of the major banks to lift its home loan rate, passing on the Reserve Bank’s latest official rate rise to customers in full. The government’s voice referendum working group met again, with the Greens’ Adam Bandt and Dorinda Cox joining the meeting. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said she was concerned about Indigenous infant health as some Closing the Gap targets go backwards. Anthony Albanese said the deepening relationship with India was a “win-win” during his visit to Ahmedabad. The PM also renewed his promise of “absolute sovereignty” as part of the Aukus deal, ahead of a submarine announcement soon. Bill Shorten said the robodebt inquiry analysis showed that a majority of victims were women. The federal government introduced a new category of Help loans in a bid to increase the number and quality of startup businesses in Australia. The Greens introduced a bill to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act, which grants logging operations an exemption from national environmental laws. A study published in the journal Nature found that smoke from the 2019-20 black summer bushfires temporarily depleted the ozone layer by 3% to 5% in 2020. Crocodiles have been sighted and residents evacuated as flood waters surge across Queensland’s saturated remote north-west communities. Liberal Alex Antic accused of ‘disgraceful comments’ about Ukraine president The Liberal senator Alex Antic has been accused of “disgraceful comments” about Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after referring to him as “the little fella from Ukraine” and appearing to forget his name. In a Senate speech, Antic, the conservative senator from South Australia, referred to the president as “whatever his name is, who cares”. In a speech about superannuation this afternoon, Antic wandered off-course to take a swipe at Anthony Albanese for marching in “colourful parades”. Albanese recently marched in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and the WorldPride march across the Harbour Bridge. “It doesn’t matter how many parades the prime minister goes off and marches in, doesn’t matter how many colourful parades he goes and marches in, doesn’t matter how many all-expenses trips he takes to go and visit the global glitterati, the little fella from Ukraine, whatever his name is in the green T-shirt,” Antic said. “Whatever his name is anyway, who cares.” Antic continued his speech and as cries of protest came from other senators, he responded: “I can’t remember what his name is, he’s just on the screen all the time.” The Labor senator and assistant minister for manufacturing, Tim Ayres, interrupted with a point of order. Antic, taking his seat, commented “here we go, this is good”. Ayres asked the acting deputy president, Liberal senator David Van, to ask Antic to withdraw his remarks. “That was an extraordinary reflection on the leader of Ukraine, who for I thought everybody in this place has been a symbol of a very important struggle for democracy and freedom,” Ayres said. Antic withdrew his remarks, adding “anyway we’ll move on. I’ve got respect for democracy.” Uber to refund exorbitant trips during Sydney Trains outage Uber has promised to refund exorbitant trips in Sydney yesterday afternoon when a train shutdown forced commuters to use the service to get home. In a statement, Uber says it will refund anyone who was charged excessively yesterday, adding that the initial price hike came before it knew what was going on: In the past we have been alerted by Transport for NSW when there were Sydney-wide transport issues, however in this instance, we were not informed of the complete outage on the NSW train network until well after it began. As soon as our team became aware of the train disruption, we immediately lowered and capped surge to still incentivise driver-partners who were helping Sydneysiders get home, while making rides more affordable for those stranded. Any rider that was charged an additional amount above that surge cap, for the full duration of the outage, will be auto-refunded within the next 48 hours. Read our story on the fallout from yesterday’s peak-hour meltdown: Victoria’s medical records bill passes parliament’s upper house The Victorian government’s health information sharing bill, which will centralise all medical records across the state’s public health system, has passed parliament’s upper house by 21 votes to 16. Guardian Australia reported yesterday that the Greens had secured increased oversight and privacy protections in exchange for the support of its four MPs, while the Animal Justice party MP, Georgie Purcell, and the two Legalise Cannabis MPs also voted in favour of the bill. From February 2024, public hospitals and services will be able to electronically share patient data – such as health conditions, allergies, medication, medical images and laboratory results – through a centralised database. The government says the new database will allow clinicians to start treatment sooner, reduce medication errors and unnecessary diagnostic tests. It has been welcomed by the Australian Medical Association Victorian branch, which says it is similar to existing schemes in place in New South Wales and Queensland. Only clinicians involved in a patient’s care can access the medical information and only for the purpose of providing care, with penalties of up to two years’ imprisonment for unauthorised access. Coalition calls on Labor to honour commitment to build subs in South Australia The opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that it is critical the PM honours the commitment to have the Aukus submarines built in South Australia. Birmingham added that the Coalition had maintained its bipartisan support for the deal, but said there were questions the government needed to answer: The commitment given when the Aukus deal was announced was for the build of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. It is critical that the Albanese government live up to the expectations they have set for South Australians and for the defence industry in terms of investment, jobs and support. This was a Coalition government achievement to make sure we had defence investment and spending at levels that made us a credible partner to pursue deals such as Aukus. There is talk of the Virginia-class submarines from the United States and then another third potential platform … What will it mean for the Collins-class [submarine]? They are all very fair questions and the government will need to have detailed answers to them. Climate minister refuses to provide safeguard mechanism modelling to Senate On Tuesday we reported the Senate had rejected the government’s public interest immunity claim in refusing to provide modelling of the safeguard mechanism and use of carbon credits. The 4pm Thursday deadline has come and gone, and the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has doubled down. In a letter to the Senate, Bowen said that disclosure of the safeguard mechanism modelling “would not be in the public interest because disclosure would reveal the deliberations of cabinet” and “due to market sensitivities relating to the government’s role as a purchaser” of carbon credits. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: It is disappointing the minister has failed to comply with the order of the Senate and is opting for secrecy over transparency. The Senate will now need to consider what recourse we take. The penalty powers of the Senate are significant, including power to deny the minister’s legislation coming to the floor for debate. The Greens are in good-faith negotiations with the government but if they continue to keep this important information secret then we will have to take that into consideration when we decide how we vote. This policy should be about making pollution from coal and gas go down, not letting it increase. If the Government is confident their plan will cut pollution from coal and gas they should release the evidence. NSW awaits weekly Covid numbers with signs a new wave is under way Weekly Covid case numbers are due out tomorrow, with last week’s data in NSW indicating a new wave of transmissions may be under way. Last week NSW recorded 6,941 new Covid cases, an 8.6% increase on the week before, with the NSW Health report noting the increased numbers likely marked “the beginning of a new wave in transmission”. The report also noted there had been an increase in the number of people with Covid attending emergency departments, with 128 in the last report, up from 107 admissions the week before. The new wave, the fourth since the Omicron variant became the dominant variant in the state, could see the first spike in cases since late December 2023. India’s decarbonisation presents good opportunities for Australia, trade minister says The trade minister, Don Farrell, was on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing just now. He talked about how Australia’s trade relationship with India has improved since January, saying that while there was demand for Australia’s fossil fuel, there was also a shift towards decarbonisation. India is very committed to decarbonisation, as is the Albanese government in Australia. I think we have great prospects of expanding our role in that decarbonisation process that’s going on in India. They’re very interested in our critical minerals but they’re also interested in the supply of hydrogen, which of course will take the place of gas as we transition to a decarbonised economy. Farrell was also asked about China, saying he expected to visit the country soon, as relations improve: Look, discussions have been going very well with the Chinese government and the Chinese minister … I’ve been invited to China and I expect that to take place in the near future. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day’s news. And on that note, I am going to bid you farewell for the week. The next parliament sitting is in another week – so politics live will be back with you then. Tomorrow though, you’ll be back with the Australia news live blog, which will bring you what is happening all over the place, not just what is (mostly) going on in the walls of parliament. A very big thank you to the team who are still beavering away and, of course, to you, who make it all worth it. We truly do have the best audience in Australia and we are very grateful to have your support. We have some exciting projects coming up and can’t wait to share some of them with you. That includes our 10th birthday celebrations during Gemini szn (the best season, obviously). Mostafa Rachani will take you through the evening – so stick around, but I hope you get some time to stare at a wall or do something fun this weekend. And as always – take care of you Ax The former prime minister Paul Keating has issued another statement railing against the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s coverage of “the threat from China”. Keating said in today’s statement – the second in three days: The Sydney Morning Herald’s prominent series of provocations, urging Australia into a war with China, concluded its third instalment today. At Item 20 of its presentation, apart from its advocacy of the reintroduction of compulsory national service, it wantonly urges that Australia should further consider ‘basing US long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons on Australian territory’ and goes on to say ‘if the US were interested in doing so’. In the following point at 21, it refers to ‘the threat from China’. The first point is, there is no threat from China, in any strategic sense. There has never been such a threat from China, either implicit or explicit. But for the Herald’s notion of it, it is urging Australia into a war with China armed with nuclear weapons on our territory to be provided by the United States. Keating – who is on the record many times calling for Australia not to be drawn into a war over the future of Taiwan, a democratically governed island of 24 million people that China has refused to rule out taking by force – repeated that argument today. He described Taiwan as “an island, off the Chinese coast, an island Australia does not recognise as an independent state, and has never recognised as an independent state”. Keating’s three-page statement ended with the line: God help us. Tory Maguire, the executive editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, Brisbane Times and WAToday, said in an emailed response to the first statement on Tuesday: Mr Keating has indulged in personal slurs against the journalists at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age instead of engaging in the substance of their reporting. It’s not a useful contribution from someone well placed to have a meaningful impact on the conversation about our readiness to protect and defend Australia. Peter Hartcher and Matthew Knott are two of the country’s most highly respected journalists and we stand by their reporting and the expertise of the contributors to the challenging and thought-provoking Red Alert series. We note he had nothing to say when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Sky News Australia also recently examined the threat of conflict with China and our nation’s preparedness. The blue in the teal rises above the green on franking credits Revisiting the franking credits issue, I have just looked at where the house landed on the Treasury amendment bill. These bills are fairly regular – usually just changes to instruments or closing loopholes and more about the machinery of government and Treasury than anything else. This one though included tightening up the rules around dividend imputation (franking credits) when it comes to how companies raise capital and aligning off-market buybacks with on-market buybacks. (I am not wealthy enough to know all the detail on this, and chances are, neither are most people reading this – it is only going to save about $600m so that is not huge numbers in the scheme of things.) The bill is with the Senate economics committee, which will look at the changes. The Coalition has already called it a broken election promise and argue Labor is coming after franking credits. (This is nowhere near what Labor proposed in 2019.) BUT The teals have split on the amendments. Angus Taylor and the Coalition tried to move an amendment which would have removed the franking credit changes (which doesn’t have a chance of winning in a chamber where the government holds the numbers, but is all about optics). Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Sophie Scamps and Zoe Daniel voted with the opposition. Helen Haines and Kate Chaney voted with the government. Zali Steggall abstained and Monique Ryan was absent from the vote because of a family bereavement. This is going to happen – the teal independents represent some of the wealthiest electorates in the country where their constituents care about these things. And at those times, the blue in the teal is going to rise above the green. • This post was updated on 14 March 2023 to reflect the fact that Monique Ryan was absent from the vote, rather than abstained. Queensland releases child sentencing data as raise the age debate drags on The nation’s leaders are dragging their heels when it comes to raising the age of criminal responsibility. Currently, it is 10. Yup, 10. While there are movements from some states and territories to go it alone if there is not national cabinet agreement, not all states are on board. AAP has reported on the Queensland situation: Children aged under 14 make up a very small proportion of people sentenced in Queensland, and alternative approaches could be considered to reduce the risk of reoffending, a report says. Fewer than one in 10 children sentenced in Queensland between 2005 and 2022 were under the age of 14, a Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council report says. Those under the age of 10 make up 1.1% of children sentenced. The council chair, John Robertson, says coming into contact with the criminal justice system at a young age increases the likelihood of reoffending, so there could be a discussion about alternatives. “When we consider the life circumstances of many of these younger children, and the type of offending they engage in, it is not surprising that there are questions being asked about the benefits of criminalising children at such a young age,” the former children’s court president said. Queensland’s age of criminal responsibility is 10, and the report showing low numbers of those under 14 are being sentenced comes amid a national push to increase the age to 12 in all states and territories. However, a draft report last year recommended raising the age to 14 without exception, with the Northern Territory and ACT committing to that and Tasmania planning to lift its minimum age of detention to 14. The Queensland attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, has said she supports a national approach rather than going it alone. The sentencing report comes as state parliament prepares to debate youth justice laws that have bipartisan support but have been condemned by legal groups, social service providers and experts. There’s concern that making it a criminal offence for children to breach bail conditions and handing them longer sentences will put more kids behind bars for longer, increasing their chances of reoffending. The council’s report says more than half of children aged 10 to 13 who were sentenced were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and that the overrepresentation of Indigenous kids increased among the youngest cohorts. Some 482 children under the age of 14 were sentenced in 2021-22, with 38 of those younger than 12, which was lower than the annual average of 651 over the previous 17 years. “Sentenced cases did not return to pre-pandemic levels,” the report says. More than 80% of children under 13 were sentenced for property offences such as unlawful entry, wilful damage and stealing, with courts giving reprimands or probation orders in more than half of cases. Only 2.1% of child sentences involved detention with almost half of those being for burglary or unlawful entry. “Of the small number of cases involving serious offences sentenced in the higher courts, children under 14 at the time of the offence were most often sentenced for robbery,” Robertson said. “However, this only represented 3.4% of all sentenced robbery cases across Queensland.” Read our story, by Ben Smee, here: The federal government has created a new category of Help loans in a bid to increase the number and quality of startup businesses in Australia. The education legislation amendment (startup year and other measures) bill 2023 – a Labor election commitment first proposed in 2015 – will allow 2,000 entrepreneurs to defer the cost of accessing startup accelerator programs each year. The startup year program was introduced to parliament on Thursday after a six-week consultation on the loam scheme last year. It’s expected to cost the government $15.4m over four years. Education minister Jason Clare: A lot of universities have start up incubators and accelerators and offer grants to students to help them build businesses from scratch. This will add to that, offering HELP loans to bring their business ideas to life.” Universities Australia said the startup year program would bring “much-needed” financial support for university entrepreneurs. Just two Australian cities rank in the top 1,000 for startups globally - Sydney (38) and Melbourne (42). Universities Australia acting chief executive Peter Chesworth said financial barriers hindered the progress of innovation in the higher education sector and its “transformative flow-on effects, including the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities”: Universities support the Albanese government’s commitment to breaking down these barriers and supporting the commercialisation of new ideas and solutions to the challenges and opportunities facing our nation. ‘Giving in to the Greens’ demands is a smack in the face to Tasmanians’: Tammy Tyrrell on NRF Jacqui Lambie Network senator Tammy Tyrrell is not happy with the amendment the Greens have secured as part of the negotiations for the party’s support of the national reconstruction fund. Tyrell says the government owes the Tasmanian forestry industry an apology, after writing to the peak body in May 2022 to say there would be no issues in a Labor government: The prime minister said in his letter: ‘The Liberals have gone into overdrive saying that Labor will listen to the Greens. This is nothing but a desperate scare campaign designed to cover up for the fact that Scott Morrison has been a major disappointment for your industry.’ “ The prime minister also said ‘Labor will support native forest harvesting.’ Giving in to the Greens’ demands is a smack in the face to Tasmanians. The prime minister needs to come out and explain this about face. It’s all well and good to tell the industry you support them during an election, but when you’re in government and push comes to shove, apparently you can forget pretty quickly. I don’t think the Greens are bad people, but my word, sometimes they’ve got some bad ideas. The government’s got to be prepared to call it out, not back it in.” As Caitlin Cassidy says – the AFL could learn from this. But I bet they’ve never had Meatloaf. Tomorrow is the last day of the public hearings for the robodebt royal commission. Here was Bill Shorten’s summary, delivered in question time, of some of what the commission has heard: Analysis of data provided to the royal commission into Robodebt reveals that a majority of Robodebt victims were women. In fact, at least 226,780 Australian women were served unlawful debt notices over four and a half years by the former Coalition government. These are their stories. Angelica. Angelica says that soon after she had a Robodebt raised against her, she had to deal with the grief of her father passing away. She says she didn’t have money in the bank and had her daughter to think of. “My depression became very bad while dealing with the Robodebt. I wanted to kill myself. I started drinking heavily, a couple of bottles of wine each day causing liver problems. I had to go to hospital and my doctor wasn’t happy with me. I started seeing a psychologist. To this day, I still get anxiety when I think about my Robodebt. The government should care about people who are struggling. People who have depression or money troubles. They shouldn’t make their lives worse.” Then there’s Isabella. She received a Robodebt at a particularly difficult point in her life. “I was living day to day when I was hit with a Robodebt. I was homeless due to fleeing from family violence. What little money I was receiving from Centrelink payments went towards my food and my medication. Then one day there was less money in my account than I was expecting for my Newstart allowance, I thought it had been a mistake. I called Centrelink. I was not met with concern for my wellbeing. They told me I had a debt and needed to prove I didn’t owe money.” In a submission to the royal commission by a woman who wishes to remain anonymous, she explains how she was a young, single parent working when she received her Robodebt. “I cried myself to sleep for two weeks thinking about where my daughter would go if I went to jail. I contacted her father for help financially after never receiving child support from him while she was fully in my care. He then decided to take me to court and obtain shared custody of my daughter. Robodebt caused myself depression, anxiety and financial stress, which resulted in me having my daughter taken from my full care. To say Robodebt ruined my life is a complete understatement”. These are stories that were never heard by the Coalition when they were in government. Like a lot of members on this side, I’ve represented people who’ve been injured at work. Compensation is important. It’s expected, but it’s never the full story. Accountability matters to the royal commission cannot reverse the pain of these three brave witnesses. It can’t bring back loved ones, but it can make sure that those who did the wrong thing answer for it. It can. And it must make sure that no government ever unlawfully bullies vulnerable Australians ever. Meanwhile, in remote Queensland: Crocodiles have been sighted and residents evacuated as floodwaters surge across Queensland’s saturated remote north-west communities, AAP reports. Flood warnings are in place for hundreds of kilometres of the Gulf’s inland rivers and creeks as a late-season monsoon trough continues to batter northern Australia. Rainfall records have tumbled as the deluge lashed Queensland’s Far North, potentially isolating remote communities for weeks. Supplies in the towns of Doomadgee and Burke are running low, with buying restrictions in place on essential food items. Roads and highways are cut, with food now being transported by air to ensure adequate food supplies for the region. Overnight, the system continued to batter the region, with falls of 278mm at Riversleigh and 220mm at Century Mine. Julia Creek received 171mm, with 158mm at Dugald River and 148mm at Julius Dam. Severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are forecast for Cloncurry and Rollingstone, and south of Croydon and Townsville. The system will also bring widespread rain, thunderstorms and damaging wind gusts to parts of the Northern Territory, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned. Question time ends But wait –the Speaker has a message for those Very Concerned About The Flag (of which Liberal MP Dan Tehan is president) I want to update the house regarding the flag above parliament house. As I stated to the house yesterday, I understand and recognise the importance of the Australian national flag. I am pleased to advise the process has an expedited to replace the flag. Weather permitting protocols will be put in place to replace the flag within the next two days. Furthermore, alternative options and contingencies for this ever happen again for the future. Thank goodness. We can once again sleep at night. Liberal MP’s question about a Sydney mayor and NSW election ruled out of order The Liberal MP for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, who has come back to parliament with the strategy of yelling her questions in question time (I have been told that some in Labor have begun referring to the honourable member as Melissa ‘Capslock’ McIntosh) has a question for Chris Bowen: Is it true that the minister has taken time out from the task of tackling rising energy prices to hold discussions with a western Sydney mayor ahead of him announcing he will not run as an independent candidate in the New South Wales election? Did the minister discuss federal government funding or support with the mayor? Tony Burke is on his feet immediately referring the Speaker to “the list of prohibited questions on page 553 of practice. The first dot point.” Milton Dick rules the question out of order. In between all of the Stephen Jones questions, Linda Burney gave this answer to a dixer on Closing the Gap targets: Mick Dodson was the social justice commissioner between 1993 and 1998. And one of the quotes from Mick has stayed with me ever since that time. He talked about a type of industrial deafness that descended upon us as Australians about the dreadful social justice statistics when it came to Aboriginal people in this country. And I think there is something true in what he says in terms of those statistics, washing off us. Washing over us. And flowing on. And the latest Productivity Commission’s data is in fact an example of what I hope everyone will listen to. Some of the Closing the Gap targets are going backwards. And I know many people are frustrated by this lack of progress. I know that I am. On the existing data, 11 targets are now not on track. And four are on track. The one that really concerns me that has, where the statistics have gone backwards slightly, is the healthy birth weight of babies. It has gone backwards and this is a major concern when you think about all the things that need to sit underneath a baby being born at a healthy birth weight. It is not good enough and I know everyone in this House agrees with that. And we do need to do things differently. That means listening to communities about the solutions that work best for them. Not what we think as politicians. Not what bureaucrats think. But what actually communities are saying. The Closing the Gap implementation plan launched last month is a practical way forward. It lays out a plan for us to achieve the targets and priority reforms set out in the national agreement. It includes more than $400m for additional spending by this government, safe and reliable water supply, better buildings in remote housing, improving food security, and of course boosting family violence and legal service providers that I know the Leader of the opposition is most concerned about. One bright spark is the Northern Territory police have advised that the violence-related activities has fallen by 30%, and so has domestic violence since the implementation of the alcohol restrictions in the Northern Territory. The government’s voice referendum working group has met again today, with the Greens’ Adam Bandt and Dorinda Cox joining the meeting. The expert group advising the government on the voice to parliament referendum is due to present its final advice on the constitutional alteration and the referendum question next week, so this week’s meeting is a bit of a precursor ahead of the main event. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney issued a communique after the meeting, which also included herself, attorney general Mark Dreyfus, special envoy for reconciliation Pat Dodson, and foreign minister Penny Wong (representing PM Anthony Albanese, who is of course in India). The communique says the working group “progressed its discussions about the wording of the change to the constitution and the question on the ballot paper.” There has been some minor disagreement about whether the voice should have the power to advise the executive government, as well as the parliament. Burney’s office confirmed the government would introduce the constitution alteration bill to parliament in the coming sitting fortnight at the end of March, which will be followed by a parliamentary inquiry. Working group members described the meeting with Bandt and Cox as “positive” and that they had expressed “solid support” for the referendum. Back to the Stephen Jones hour, Paul Fletcher wants to know: Can the Minister explain to the house whether the capital gains tax discount ordinarily applicable for assets held within superannuation is available for either realised or unrealised gains under the Government’s new super tax? Jones: I thank the Leader of Opposition business in the house for the question. Of course, as all honourable members and particularly the member for Forde would know, as I non-licensed financial advisor, I can’t give financial advice either... Here or anywhere else. Peter Dutton pretends to have a point of order I have been here 22 years, I thought I had heard it all. Milton Dick says no point of order. Jones: As I was saying, I was invited to give financial advice. But what I can say, in the general, Mr Speaker, is the capital gains discount is available when there is a capital gains tax event. Sydney commuters – you should be able to get home. This is from Sydney Trains: A normal timetabled service operated this morning on the Sydney Trains network with only minor disruptions across the network following yesterday’s delays. Today’s afternoon and evening services will also operate to a normal timetable. The investigation into the root cause of yesterday’s Digital Train Radio System (DTRS) failure identified the failure of router equipment not operating correctly. The equipment has been replaced and the system is operating. Sydney Trains is raising this in discussion with our suppliers. The DTRS is a vital safety feature for the network which is the primary communication tool between the Rail Operations Centre and train crew on the network to alert them of any unexpected issues and emergencies. Sydney Trains again apologises to our customers for the delays experienced and thanks everybody for their understanding as staff worked to get people home safely. Katter mystifies; Marles applauds him Bob Katter has the last crossbench question and I wish I could tell you what it is about. I think most of the chamber wishes they knew what it was about. As always, it is a journey, delivered in the cadence of a bedtime story from your great-grandpa who returned from the war after decades lost in the jungle. Something about development of regional Australia I think. Richard Marles thanks Katter and says: Can I spotlight his extraordinary achievement? And in doing so acknowledge his advocacy - a little shameless - and acknowledge his advocacy on behalf of his electorate but more significantly on behalf of regional Australia. It’s important that is done because the story of our nation is not just written in Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne. It is written in places like Mount Isa and Rockhampton, Newcastle and indeed in Geelong. And as an inhabitant of regional Australia, I understand how important it is that we are doing everything we can to provide opportunities for people to make their lives and to raise their families in regional Australia. That’s at the heart of what you are describing in your question. There is huge opportunities that I know the honourable member is describing in terms of his own electorate, where that development can occur. I want to say to him on behalf of the Albanese government regional Australia is front and centre in how we see the development of our nation. And we will continue to engage with him on this. As to the question of the budget, you’ll have to wait until the second Tuesday in May and the words of the treasurer about what is ultimately committed there but I can absolutely say that the Treasurer, the prime minister, myself will continue to work with you, to make sure that we are delivering the development and the benefits in regional Australia that you are such a keen advocate for. Marles says power prices would’ve gone up ‘a lot more’ if Coalition had their way The shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien, who has become a favourite of Chris Bowen after he went to Japan and posted a ‘what we can learn about nuclear power’ video, has a question for Richard Marles: Will electricity prices go up by 20% over winter? Marles: Whatever happens with electricity prices in the future, they would have gone up a lot more if those opposite had their way last December. Because last December those opposite were given an opportunity to vote on behalf of the household budgets of the Australian people, by supporting a $1.5bn package which is working. If you look at the forward electricity prices, as they were announced in February, they are half what they were in November. Those opposite are the ones who stand to increase electricity prices. There are a million interjections. The point is that power prices were always going to still increase, they just weren’t going to increase by as much. You know what Marles does have the power to do though? Stop question time. Chris Bowen dives into ‘key points’ on safeguard mechanism The independent MP for North Sydney Kylea Tink has a question: This week New South Wales is again being besieged by bushfires while the Northern Territory and Queensland have had serious flooding. Daniel went on climate action requires us to rapidly reduce gross emissions. The safeguard mechanism in its current form does not guarantee this. Minister, what would you say to the people of North Sydney who say this legislation allow Australia’s biggest polluters to buy their way out of responsibility by purchasing unlimited carbon credits? Chris Bowen: I thank the member for her question and the engagement she has had with me today on the safeguard mechanism and the reforms. The first thing I would say to the honourable member is that the most important thing we can do as a parliament in coming weeks, to ensure on-site abatement in the facilities covered is to pass the bill, because the safeguard crediting bill actually provides a huge incentive for facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism to reduce their emissions. Because if they reduce their emissions by more than the baseline, they get a credit that they can use in future years or sell. That means that there is an incentive for them to invest in technology to reduce their own emissions. (This is the ‘it is better than nothing, we need a mechanism’ argument Labor have been using.) Bowen: The honourable members opposite used to believe that. This side of the house still believes that. That is the first thing we can do to encourage on-site abatement. The second point I make more broadly is that the safeguard reforms put these facilities on a very important pathway to net zero, and provides an ongoing incentive for them to invest in abatement. It is important for them to have flexibility in how they do so because we are requiring a 4.9% reduction each year, and different facilities were technologies available to them at different times. The 215 facilities cover a wide range of industries, airlines, aluminium smelters, fossil fuel expansion.and many others. (This is the ‘we have to start somewhere’ argument Labor have been using) Bowen: I understand the intention by the question, but these are the key points. In the final point I would make is the government last year commissioned the Chubb review of Australian carbon credits to ensure their integrity after questions are raised. Not everybody loves everything in the review, but the review conducted by the former Chief Scientist of Australia supported by the honourable Doctor Annabel Bennett, a KC, and they have done a very exhausting review and recommended changes which even the critics acknowledged would be world ‘s best practice governors going forward to ensure the integrity. I do not accept that carbon credits are some form of lesser abatement. I do agree we need a focus on on-site abatement, but whether it is Indigenous savanna burning on the other methods, there are real and very important project supported by Australian carbon credit units. They will be supported even more by the rigorous safeguard mechanism that I will be putting deal for the house and in the regulation and in the Senate, and I welcome the support of all members for these important measures and I remain available to honourable members who wish to discuss improvement in good faith. (This is ‘the science says we have to do something and this is what we think we can do’ argument) Dutton gets in on the Stephen Jones party It’s back to the Stephen Jones hour and Peter Dutton wants to know: Can the minister identified any act of parliament that currently has a provision to impose a tax on unrealised gains? Jones (after so many interjections that Voltron* would have had time to form, break up and reform using the long space sequence) This is a new reform. We are doing things in a different way. I am asked by the honorable member if there is to … If there is another part of the taxation law where unrealised capital gains are taxed. Yes, there is. Corporations tax. Yay for staffers running with answers. *Voltron was the Power Rangers before the Power Rangers, which I just learned is up to its 30th season. Jones asked about superannuation losses and tax refunds Ross Vasta, the LNP MP for Bonner, has a question for … Stephen Jones! My question is to the assistant treasurer and concerns the government’s new super tax. If an Australian who owns an asset through his or her superannuation fund receives a tax bill buzz of an unrealised gain in one year, but this asset is subsequently revalued resulting in a loss, will that Australian be eligible for a refund of the tax paid? Jones: I thank the honourable member for his question. It’s a good question. And it’s why when we have announced the policy to ensure that we can maintain the integrity of superannuation and superannuation tax concessions, which are costing the budget in excess of $50bn a year, more than we spend on Medicare, more than we spend on the NDIS, significant budget expenditure. It’s why when we announced this policy, we put in place a lengthy period for the implementation on it and a lengthy period to ensure that we can consult on some of these details, including details which go to the question that the honourable member has asked about the capacity to bring losses forward or backwards. We will consult on the specific design implementation of these issues, as any government would and indeed as the previous government did when they introduced the $6bn worth of taxation changes to the superannuation system. That is 155 words to say “we don’t know” but also, that is something that you wouldn’t expect to be known just yet either – the policy, which has no legislation as yet also doesn’t come into effect until 1 July 2025, AFTER the next election. Liberals have ‘laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires’: Jones Back to the Stephen Jones experience, and LNP MP Michelle Landry wants to know: My question is to the assistant treasurer and concerns the government’s new super tax. Can the minister advise the House of how many primary producers and small and family businesses have been identified in treasury modelling as being impacted by the government’s new super tax? Jones: Just for context in answering this question, the average superannuation balance for a retiree today is $150,000. $150,000. For women, around about $130,000 to $140,000. For men, around about $180,000. I’ve got to say in this debate, I’m enjoying the focus on superannuation, I’ve got to say. But I’ve got to say from the party which aspires to be the representatives of working people, they have a laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires. A laser-like focus on the interests of multimillionaires. Not one, not two, but three questions in a row focused on the interests of a half of 1% of Australians. Landry wants to know about relevance. Jones: I’m asked about the impact, Mr Speaker, of the government’s very reasonable … Superannuation proposals which are supported by over 65% of Australians. Including the majority of Liberal party voters and many on the other side. If you want to know what the impact is, it’s about a half of 1% of Australians and about a half of 1% of Australians and, yes, of course, given that this won’t come into effect for another two years, we will engage in a meaningful consultation, including with the farming sector, to ensure that any unintended consequences, including the type that the member for Capricornia is eluding to and the member, the other members have eluded to, we’ll engage in meaningful consultation with all of these groups to ensure the unintended consequences are not falling upon them. But let’s be very, very clear – when you’ve got a trillion dollars worth of debt, you can’t twiddle your thumbs. We won’t be twiddling our thumbs. There are a whole bunch of interjections, because it is very important that millionaires know how much the Coalition is backing them in, but the parliament moves on. The Australian government and the opposition have joined together to assure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific that the soon-to-be-announced Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan aims to safeguard “the peace and the stability of our region”. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, did not confirm the details that have been leaked in the US and the UK – such as the acquisition of up to five US Virginia class submarines as a stopgap to British designed submarines – saying the announcement would be made “very shortly”. (It’s due to be made in San Diego on Monday, US time.) Marles acknowledged that the 18-month process with the US and the UK started under the former government. He specifically mentioned former PM Scott Morrison and former defence minister Peter Dutton “because this is a moment that we want to be – and we know is – a bipartisan moment of huge significance to our country”. Marles told parliament: It is difficult to overstate the step that, as a nation, we are about to take. Australia will become just of the seventh country to have the ability to operate a nuclear powered submarine. We have never operated a military capability at this level before. This will be a massive industrial endeavour, which will see thousands of jobs created over the coming decades, but much more importantly, will contribute to the technological advancement of our wider economy. Clearly, these submarines will have the capability to operate at war, but the true intent of this capability is to provide for the stability and for the peace of our region – for the Pacific, for South-east Asia, for the Indian Ocean, for the broader Indo-Pacific region – because the defence of Australia doesn’t really mean that much unless we can have collective security. As a trading island nation, any adversary can do a whole lot of harm to Australia without even setting foot on our shores, which means a nation we are deeply invested in the global rules-based order which has underpinned the stability of prosperity, the incredible economic growth of east Asia. So the totality of our strategic intent is to defend rules-based order. So I want to say at this moment to our neighbours and to our friends around the world that as Australia invests in its defence, as we acquire this nuclear-powered submarine capability, we do so as part of making our contribution to the peace and the stability of our region and of well. Dutton, now the opposition leader, added that he wanted to pay tribute to Morrison “without whom Aukus would not have been a reality”. Dutton said the decision to approach the UK in the first instance and through the UK to the US “was the vision of prime minister Morrison, and I pay tribute to him”. Dutton added: And as the acting prime minister and the minister for defence rightly point out, our neighbours should hear the very clear message that this is about providing peace and stability for our future and for theirs. Australia is a friend and partner and a valued friend and partner to people within our region and across our partnerships, including the Quad, including our Five Eyes partners, and that will always be the case. We are not an aggressive nation. We are a nation that strives for peace. Dutton, who was rebuked by the British high commissioner to Australia earlier this week for warning against a yet-to-be-developed British design, said the Australian people could see “the two major parties in this country working together in the nation’s best interests”. He pledged bipartisan support (while leaving room for raising concern about timeframes): We will support the decisions of the government under Aukus and fight to make sure the outcome is achieved as quickly as possible. Greens take aim at stage-three tax cuts but Marles says ‘position hasn’t changed’ Stephen Bates, the Greens MP for Brisbane who won the election but then had to go work his retail shift so he could pay his rent (which is part of the generational change we are seeing in younger politicians, not just here, but globally), asks Richard Marles about the stage-three tax cuts: Confronted by rising inequality and the cost of living crisis the government has made a welcome shift on [superannuation] tax breaks for super wealthy. Will you change the tax three tax cuts that also disproportionately benefit the super wealthy? Marles: As he knows and … I think everybody in here knows our position on that hasn’t changed. Ed Husic continues national reconstruction fund victory lap The industry minister gets a dixer on the topic, where he again calls the Coalition the “No-alition”, something started by Jim Chalmers or Anthony Albanese but really most likely someone in the tactics team who gets paid a lot of money to come up with silly little names for political opponents. Milton Dick says no and orders the opposition be called by their correct name. Husic doesn’t even pretend to be contrite. Stephen Jones prodded again on super changes It is back to the Stephen Jones prodding session. David Littleproud wants to know: If a family farm business asset is held in a self-managed super fund as part of their diverse portfolio … could increases in asset value during their financial year see that family pay additional tax … under the government’s superannuation changes? Jones: Yes, it is true that there are going to be a very small number of individuals, funds who will be paying more money under this arrangement. Yes, there is. We wouldn’t be doing it otherwise, and the object of the change is to ensure, on the one hand, that we maintain the integrity of our superannuation system, and on the other hand we also make a contribution to the debt that those opposite have left us. Now, in relation to any self-managed superannuation fund, that has assets in excess of $3m, the earnings on those assets under $3m will continue to attract the concessional tax rate of 15%. The earnings on the assets above $3m will still attract a very concessional tax rate, but not as generous as before the change. There are a lot of interjections, as you would expect. Jones gets back to it: That is the point. And I am asked about cashflow. These are very simple concepts. … It is still concessional. The reason that we are doing it is to ensure the integrity of the superannuation system, and to plug the $1tn worth of debt. There are more interjections and what looks like a point of order coming, but Jones completes his answer. Everyone loves submarines, nuclear and otherwise. Daniel Hurst will bring you the new information on this (which comes after Anthony Albanese confirmed what everyone knew but had to pretend like they couldn’t say – that there will be an Aukus announcement in San Diego next week) Moving on. Assistant treasurer targeted by Coalition to explain super changes Just a few weeks ago, the Coalition identified Julie Collins as a potential weak link in explaining government policy – you may remember the number of questions she received each session. This time round, it is assistant treasurer Stephen Jones who is getting the weak link treatment. After not doing a particularly great job yesterday in explaining the super concessional changes and what is and isn’t part of them, he is being targeted again by the Coalition for another round. Looks like he has been pointed in the right direction from the beginning this time round – there is much less waffling. Asked about things like the family farm being held in super and whether or not that would be taxed at a higher rate under Labor’s changes, Jones says: Indeed, under section 52(b) of the legislation, trustees have existing obligations. They have obligations to have regard to the liquidity of assets within their fund, the diversity of assets within their fund, and the ability of the fund to discharge their obligations, including taxation obligations, Mr Speaker. I stand by the answer that I gave yesterday. Speaker. I stand by the answer that I gave yesterday. Which is what he was trying to say yesterday, but the message became a little muddled, opening the door for Coalition attacks. The chamber is filling – it is time for the last question time of the sitting. Franking credits, super tax concessions, energy prices – you could almost write these posts now. But alas, we shall wait for democracy to play out. Conservative senators try to have Covid vaccination status protected from discrimination Interesting times in the Senate (timeless statement). The Merry Band of Misfits of Matt Canavan, Alex Antic, Gerard Rennick and Ralph Babet have tried to have Covid vaccination status as a protected attribute under the Fair Work anti-discrimination provisions. This lovely mix of LNP outliers, what’s left of the Palmer United party and more often than not One Nation is always a good time in the Senate, but particularly when they seek to choose who should be protected from discrimination. It won’t shock you to learn that Malcolm Roberts was on board with this, but the Coalition as a whole, was not. That broad church just keeps getting broader. We are almost at question time. May Dolly have mercy on our souls. Albanese ‘very honoured’ by billboards of his face across India Apparently there are hundreds of billboards in India with Anthony Albanese’s face on them, celebrating his visit. Asked about it, Albanese says: It is hard to not have noticed them, yes. Certainly I’m very honoured – not for myself, for Australia. It says how valued the relationship with Australia is that the government of India and prime minister Modi have put such a major effort into making us feel so welcome. The prime minister is asked about the Virginia Class submarine report coming out of the US. Anthony Albanese says: I’ll be making further comments about specific proposals at the appropriate time, but I can confirm that on Monday there will be a meeting of the Aukus partners, between myself, President Biden, and Prime Minister Sunak, in addition in the United States I will be having bilateral meetings with President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak. I look forward to announcing those details. They will be announced in the appropriate way on Monday, US time, in San Diego. Q: Will Australia retain sovereignty over the technology, if there is a disagreement over whether to use the tech in any future (hypothetical) conflict? Albanese: Australia will retain absolutely our sovereignty, our absolute sovereignty, 100%. It is very important that Australia as a sovereign nation state – and that’s something that’s respected by all of our partners as well. He finishes with: I will be making comments at the appropriate time when we’ve made the announcements. This is a joint arrangement between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. We’re great friends. We have over a century of standing side by side during peacetime and during conflict, and I look forward to the announcements next week. India visit about clean energy, trade and defence, Albanese says Trade missions are always a little alien – lots of speeches, lots of looking at business and awkward question and answers and lots of standing around. Anthony Albanese has just completed one of those awkward moments at a smart energy company and is now speaking to the travelling media outside: Towards the end of this year I’m looking forward to an upgrade in the economic relationship between Australia and India, and I’ll be having discussions with prime minister Modi about that today. Already this morning, I’ve met with 34 smart energy companies who are here from Australia, providing significant investment, seizing the opportunity that is there. One of the things that we discussed was the fact that there’s a lot of investment ready as well in Australia to build solar panels in Australia. And I’m very pleased that the National Reconstruction Fund legislation passed the House of Representatives a short time ago. They’re the sort of measures that we need in place, measures that drive our economy towards clean energy, measures that then take advantage of cleaner, cheaper energy to make more things in Australia. And that is why we also want to then train Australians for those jobs through fee-free TAFE, through 20,000 additional university places, through 10,000 – $10,000 new energy apprenticeships that we’ve announced as well. This is a coherent economic plan for Australia’s economic future. That is very important. And the third element of the visit is, of course, defence and security. And I will be boarding the first-ever significant naval ship built here in India in Mumbai later today. We will be hosting the Malabar operations in Australia for the first time later this year and talking about our security in the Indo-Pacific is an important focus of our relationship. These are all important. Albanese says deepening relationship with India is a ‘win-win’ Anthony Albanese spoke a little bit ago at Ahmedabad in India. He says strengthening the relationship with India is “win-win”, particularly when it comes to renewable energy. Australia has a role in engaging with India as well as with other countries in our region. But it also makes good economic sense. It’s about Australian jobs and about Australian businesses growing. It is, indeed, smart economics not just smart energy. ‘A more formal announcement’ coming on Aukus: Husic Ed Husic was also asked whether he was unimpressed with leaks out of the US and the UK surrounding the Aukus announcement due early next week – and about whether there will be enough work for Australian industry. The minister for industry and science said: I would just say that again at the appropriate point the deputy prime minister and defence minister will make a more formal announcement about what we do and I’ll leave it at that. Minister refuses to be drawn on Aukus The minister for industry and science, Ed Husic, has refused to be drawn on the looming Aukus announcement – including how important it would be to plug the capability gap and whether he could confirm Australia would purchase up to 5 Virginia class submarines from the US. Husic told reporters in the blue room that he admired the “deft way” in which the question was asked, but added: No career limiting moves by me, if you don’t mind. He pivoted to the topic of the day - the National Reconstruction Fund - saying it would be able to support the evolution of important capabilities expected by strategic partners, including quantum technologies. Labor criticised over ‘enhanced income management’ Labor “abolished” the cashless welfare card (the Basics card was never changed). Or did it. The “enhanced income management smart card” which is in its place, seems pretty much the same, at least according to the shadow minister, Anne Rushton. Indue still runs the scheme. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson and welfare recipient Kristin O’Connell has also criticised amendments Labor has introduced into the parliament, particularly with these sections: Item 36 amends paragraph 123SF(3)(b) to extend the eligibility criteria for individuals who seek to volunteer for the enhanced IM regime to usually reside within a ‘voluntary enhanced income management area (see item 38 for this term). Item 38 inserts new subsection 123SF(5) to allow the Minister to determine, by legislative instrument, that a specified State, Territory or area is a voluntary enhanced IM area for the purpose of Part 3AA. Item 40 amends subparagraph 123SG(1)(a)(ii) to extend the eligibility criteria for individuals who seek to volunteer for the enhanced IM regime to usually reside within a ‘voluntary enhanced income management area.’ The Minister may specify these areas by legislative instrument made under subsection 123SF(5) (see item 38 above). The Minister intends to specify only existing voluntary IM areas at this time. O’Connell: Without warning, Labor has today introduced a bill to dramatically expand the minister’s discretion. And now they want the minister to be able to roll it out wherever she likes, and whenever she likes. They are inviting the next Coalition government to force income control on every welfare recipient in the country when they inevitably return to power. The deception is sickening. We condemn this decision and urge the government to change course. Please, recommit to ensuring no one can be forced to be on cashless welfare. Adam Bandt on Lidia Thorpe’s claims Adam Bandt has also shrugged off claims from former Greens senator Lidia Thorpe that the party’s lawyers advised her to say she dated former motorcycle gang member Dean Martin, which she now says was not true. A Senate privileges committee report into “possible obstruction” of the law enforcement committee – of which Thorpe was once a member – found this week she should have declared her links to Martin. But it found that the former Greens senator did not disclose any of the committee’s sensitive activities and that she should not be found in contempt. Thorpe claimed to Guardian Australia, and then later in the Senate, that she did not date Martin, despite telling the Senate committee last year in writing that they did date. I got ridiculed for something that I didn’t do. I was advised by lawyers to say that I was dating that person … I got advice from the Greens lawyers saying, ‘You have to say that you dated’. Greens sources strongly denied this was the case. Bandt declined to comment specifically, calling the privileges committee “very important”, but said he didn’t agree with Thorpe’s claims. [The privileges committee] has received submissions and statements ... I’m not going to comment on any statements about those findings or statements about statements made to the committee. I disagree with much of what was in Senator Thorpe’s statement but I’m not going to run a commentary about matters to do with the very important privileges committee. End to pre-departure Covid testing procedure for passengers from China, Hong Kong and Macau Australia has had the measures in place since 5 January, after China halted a lot of its own Covid protocols. Australia’s testing order will stop from 12.01am 11 March. From the Mark Butler release: The Australian government has been monitoring the situation in China and reviewing epidemiological data as it becomes available. Reports show the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths peaked in late December 2022/early January 2023. China has been regularly providing data to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data and to date there has been no reports of new variants of concern. Several other countries that implemented similar measures have recently either repealed their arrangements or announced an intention to repeal them, including the United States, Korea, Japan, France and Italy. Since the measure was introduced, the government has strengthened Australia’s capacity to detect and respond to emerging variants of concern of international origin – including extending community wastewater testing. National Australia Bank is the first of the major banks to lift its home loan rate, passing on the Reserve Bank’s latest official rate rise to customers in full. NAB has increased its standard variable home loan by 0.25 percentage points, with the mortgage rate increase to come into effect at the end of next week. It also increased the rate on some of its savings and deposits accounts. Australia’s central bank increased the official cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.6% on Tuesday, marking a record 10 consecutive run of hikes. The policy is designed to stifle spending and get inflation under control, but is also heaping pressure on households enduring high prices for everything from food to electricity. NAB is the first major bank to announce rate changes after the competition regulator announced last month it would investigate how banks set interest rates for savers, including the differential between bank deposit and home loan rates. Concerns over pricing have re-emerged after the country’s biggest lenders recently posted bumper profits by increasing rates on their loans at a faster pace than on their deposits over the past several months. Industry minister Ed Husic was going to be holding his national reconstruction fund success press conference in the Mural Hall, but he has since upgraded to the Blue Room. Fancy. Adam Bandt on voice: ‘There needs to be a clear message put to people’ Greens leader Adam Bandt says he hopes the voice to parliament referendum is successful, but has also backed concerns from senator Dorinda Cox about the level of detail needed to be released publicly to ensure the vote gets up. The Greens will meet the government’s referendum working group today. Cox, the party’s new spokesperson on Indigenous affairs, told the Nine newspapers that the government “needs to communicate what the referendum is all about more effectively”. Asked at a press conference, Bandt backed her comments: Senator Cox was making the point that there needs to be a clear message put to people about why this is important. We have a very clear position on that, this is a step toward First Nations justice. Bandt said there were “other things” the Greens would also push for in the Indigenous affairs space, referencing the party’s focus on the truth and treaty elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, but that he wanted the vote to win. We need a clear understanding about why this is important, because we want this referendum to succeed. Bandt said the Greens would seek info from the group on the exact referendum question to be put. He also wanted the Referendum Machinery amendments to pass - the Greens have “concerns” about some parts, including fact-checking on the official pamphlet, but those are still TBA. Happy Birthday to us!! In non political news, the Guardian is turning 10 this year. And we are celebrating the double digits with a few little surprises we will be able to tell you more about soon. Like me, the Guardian is a Gemini, so you’ll have to wait until late May – but we were hoping to bring you into the celebrations a little earlier, so if you would like to be part of the video special marking the occasion, send an email to guardian.australia.video@theguardian.com with the subject line HAPPY BIRTHDAY and we will send you instructions. I will leave it up to you to decide how many exclamation marks to put with that. Tanya Plibersek on cost-of-living relief Your regular reminder that indexation of welfare payments is not the same as actually raising the rate. It is an automatic process that occurs under regulation and who is in government has no bearing on that process, other than they don’t stop it. Which rarely, if at all happens. On another note, Tanya Plibersek was asked about cost of living relief while speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky News this morning: We’ve supported pay increases, we’ve obviously supported the largest increase in welfare benefits, indexation of pensions and other payments – the largest in twelve years. We’ve reduced the cost of medicines. Childcare costs will go down dramatically for about 1.2 million families. We know that the cost of living is a real problem for Australian families and that’s why we’re focussing on this sort of relief that really does help family budgets. Of course, our energy package was designed to bring down energy prices, which are also a big impost on family budgets. We’ve also got to repair the structural problems in the economy. We know, for example, that we’ve got skill shortages right across the country and that’s contributing to inflation. That’s the problem that the Reserve Bank’s trying to fix. So we’ve got to get into that economic reform area as well. And of course, when we have had bigger than expected receipts in the budget, we’ve put that towards actually repairing the budget as well. We were left with close to a trillion dollars of debt. Australian taxpayers are paying interest on close to a trillion dollars of debt from the previous government. Unless we begin to tackle that, the structural problems in the economy will continue to see the inflation problems that we’ve got. As we noted yesterday, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe reckoned falling housing values were contributing to weaker demand, and hence taking some of the heat out of the economy. In the December quarter, household consumption increased by just 0.3%, which, in per capita terms, represents a small decline … the combination of cost-of-living pressures, higher interest rates and the decline in housing values is weighing on consumption. Data out today from CoreLogic, a data firm, shows that its rolling 28-day tally of home values suggests that “decline” has plateaued lately: To be sure, homeowners in most parts of the country have seen property prices fall over the past year. According to CoreLogic, the 7.9% slide over the past 12 months is the largest on record. Sydney leads the falls, with values down 13.4% from a year earlier (and are 13.5% below their record high). Melbourne’s 9.6% drop from a year ago is also how much they’ve fallen from the record. Hobart’s values are off 11.8% in the past year, and a similar 12.1% retreat from the city’s record. Perth’s prices, meanwhile, are up 2.4% over the past year and are just 0.9% below their record. Darwin’s are on the rise too, with prices up 2.9% over the past year but remaining 11.5% below the city’s record set almost nine years ago. So that readers in other cities don’t feel left out: Brisbane’s values are down 6.8% in the past year (and are 11% off their highs); Adelaide’s prices are up 5.1% (to be 2.3% below their record); Canberra’s values are off 6.7% (and are down 9% from their peak). We’ll have to see whether hints at a pause in rate rises from Lowe (perhaps after one more hike in April) encourage buyers back into the property markets. Global debt ratings agency Moody’s, meanwhile, has forecast housing affordability will remain poor over this year, with Sydney the worst. In February, new home loan borrowers needed an average 30.9% of monthly income to meet monthly mortgage repayments, up from 26.4% in May 2022, when interest rates began to increase, the agency says. “We expect that ongoing housing price declines will broadly balance out further interest rate rises in terms of their effect on housing affordability this year,” it says. “If the RBA raises the cash rate to 4.1%, the share of income that borrowers need to meet repayments on new mortgages will hold around the February level if housing prices decline 4.5%.” Sydney was the least affordable city, with new borrowers needing 40.7% of household income to meet mortgage repayments in February, compared with Hobart (33.9%), Melbourne (34.5%), Adelaide (31.1%), Brisbane (27.9%), and Perth (19.3%), Moody’s said. (Sorry, Canberrans, no number for you) Fare-free day for Sydney commuters Sydney commuters will receive a free travel day some time after the election in a fortnight following the major network disruption yesterday. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Thursday apologised to voters for the shutdown that he says was believed to be the result of an IT system issue. He said: These challenges occur from time to time. What’s most important is when they happen they get fixed immediately. I’ve been assured by the secretary of the Department of Transport that this won’t happen again. I’ve made it very clear to the secretary, the department, that my expectation is that there is a fare-free day to make up some way for what occurred yesterday. He said there was no indication there was a cyber-attack on the network. Sussan Ley on reconstruction fund deal: ‘We will fight Labor’s recklessness all the way to the Senate, then to the election and beyond’ Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley has responded to the news the national reconstruction fund will pass (the Coalition is voting no): Australian households and small businesses face soaring energy bills and Labor seem determined to make it worse with Anthony Albanese caving to the Greens and selling Australian manufacturing up the creek. Every expert in the country is calling on the prime minister to unlock more supply of gas, but today’s awful deal with the Greens is another demonstration that this government is utterly unable to deliver policies that would bring affordable and reliable energy. The industry minister always claims to acknowledge the importance of gas as a transition fuel but today he is preventing investment in this critical area of our sovereign manufacturing policy. This is a bad bill that has become even worse. We will fight Labor’s recklessness all the way to the Senate, then to the election and beyond. The resources industry is the only industry singled out for prohibition in this fund, a damning indictment on the priorities of this bad Labor government. And for more information on the wheeling and dealing that led to the national reconstruction fund getting the numbers it needed in the Senate, here is Paul Karp: Ed Husic on the reconstruction fund: ‘one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen’ The industry minister is very happy to have struck a deal on the national reconstruction fund legislation with the Greens: After a decade of neglect from the former Liberal-National government, the Albanese government is revitalising Australian manufacturing. By voting against the National Reconstruction Fund, the Liberal and National parties have once again shown they are not on the side of Australian manufacturers and only care about manufacturing when it comes to a photo opportunity. We are now one step closer to delivering one of the largest peacetime investments in manufacturing this country has ever seen. The Greens will hold a press conference about the amendment they secured very soon. The About the House twitter account – which updates you on the business of the chamber – has embraced emojis. The cupcakes do not make up for the cringe memes. I’d take raising the jobseeker rate over 1m cupcakes though. And it always pays to read the terms and conditions The Greens will introduce a bill to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act which grants logging operations an exemption from national environmental laws. The party’s forests spokesperson, senator Janet Rice, will introduce the bill in the Senate today. In addition to repealing the Regional Forest Agreements Act, the bill proposes the tabling of an annual statement from the threatened species commissioner on how logging is affecting Australia’s progress towards the government’s zero extinctions target. It proposes a second statement be tabled by the environment minster outlining how logging is affecting Australia’s progress towards its commitment to protect 30% of the country’s land areas by 2030. Rice said federal and state governments had failed to meet their responsibility to protect the environment and fix failing environmental laws. She said logging operations covered by regional forest agreements had been granted an exemption from national environmental laws for too long. The Regional Forest Agreements have allowed for decades of reckless destruction of native forests across Australia, pushed native wildlife to the brink of extinction, endangered our water supplies, heightened bushfire risk, and made the climate crisis worse. If passed, this bill will end the destructive logging of Australia’s precious native forests, by repealing the Regional Forest Agreements and closing the loopholes used by the logging industry to skirt our national environment laws. The Albanese government has proposed introducing legislation to reform Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act later this year. ‘No indication so far’ cyber-attack caused Sydney rail shutdown Sydney transport bosses say there is no evidence at this stage to suggest the hour-long shutdown of the city’s rail network was related to a possible cyber-attack. During the shutdown, which saw tens of thousands of commuters stranded during peak hour on Wednesday, the transport minister, David Elliott, said that while it was likely a “glitch” in the network, he was waiting for briefings on the possibility it was due to “foreign interference or industrial sabotage”. But on Thursday the head of Sydney Trains, Matt Longland, said during a press conference that “based on the detailed review overnight” the delays were caused by a failure in a piece of technology and “wasn’t related to any suspected issue in terms of any cyber activity or any anything of that nature”. The NSW government is currently in caretaker mode in the lead-up to the state election on 25 March, and during a press briefing the chief operating officer for Transport for NSW, Howard Collins, said he had contact with Elliott and his office within minutes of the fault being discovered. Asked whether the possibility of foul play was raised during those discussions, Collins said: There is always a concern with any IT systems or even these OT systems, which are an enclosed system, is there any foreign interference or any other issue coming in to the network?” I think so far, and it’s important to say so far, we haven’t concluded the final investigation, but so far this is leading to a component failure, or a failure of overloading the system with software. We will get to the bottom of it. But no indication so far indicates this is something coming into the network like a cyber attack or data which is coming in from outside our system.” The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, is also a senator for the ACT. So if the ACT doesn’t want new coal and gas projects (as the Australia Institute polling Paul reported on has found) doesn’t that affect her too? Gallagher told the ABC: It [the findings] doesn’t surprise me. I mean, the ACT has been leading the way in terms of adoption of renewable energy targets, including when I was chief minister … we rely on 100% renewable energy now in our jurisdiction because of policies that were put in place 10 or 15 years ago, so that that doesn’t surprise me and I understand the issue more broadly, people do want to see the shift to renewable energy generation. I guess the argument we’re having is, you know, the pathway to get there and the transition to get there. That doesn’t just affect people in the ACT, it affects the entire country, and the country … is very different, as we know. But the safeguard mechanism is … a real opportunity to make huge progress forward in reducing our emissions in a way where we can all work together and so I am really hopeful that we don’t get to a situation where we have a stalemate in the Senate on this – like that we can’t make something that doesn’t please everyone to 100% – [a] stall in the face of the progress that we know we need to make. So we’re just going to continue to talk with Senator Pocock and others to get this through the Senate because it’s essential if we’re going to make the first and important steps to reducing emissions from our biggest polluters. GetUp calls for referendum machinery changes to fight voter suppression of First Nations youth GetUp’s CEO, Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, says the government needs to ensure an amendment to the referendum machinery legislation (which sets up how the referendum will be held) that will ensure all voting age First Nations people can cast their vote needs to pass. Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman, said further disenfranchisement from the voting process will only hurt the referendum’s success: For over a decade we’ve been fighting voter suppression in First Nations communities. Voters have been purged from the electoral roll and years of Coalition-led funding cuts has meant enrolment rates and access to voting has dropped. The provisional voting amendment to the referendum bill will undo years of suppression and ensure that thousands of First Nations people will have access to voting in this referendum. It will mean that people in remote communities have access to enrol on election day. We saw how similar reforms in the Northern Territory elections increased voter turnout. The referendum has to uphold the best of our democratic process, without this costless measure we will continue to experience yet another form of voter suppression. This is something that communities and the AEC supports. This amendment would give thousands of First Nations people across the country the right to vote in a referendum that is all about our vision for our communities. We cannot have a referendum that directly impacts First Nations communities, without first ensuring every eligible First Nations person can vote on it. Immigration minister grants residency to migrant family who faced removal because of son’s medical condition Some welcome news in the case of the Aneesh family in Perth, who faced being removed from Australia because of their son’s medical condition. The ABC reported that the family of 10-year-old Aaryan, who lives with Down Syndrome, had failed Australia’s visa test, which considers the potential cost a migrant’s staying in Australia might have on the public health system. The system has been consistently criticised as discriminatory against people with disabilities. The family exhausted its appeals options, but, this week, the immigration minister. Andrew Giles, has personally intervened and said the family would be granted permanent residency. They told the ABC they were “overjoyed” at the minister’s decision. “We can stay here, we can live in this community, we can provide a very good environment for our kids,” Aaryan’s mother said. David Pocock, as one of the deciding votes in the senate when the Coalition says yeah, nah to voting to legislation is under a lot of pressure – not just from the negotiations himself, but his constituency in the ACT as Paul Karp reports: Want to know more about the safeguard mechanism deadlock? The audio team have you covered: Daniel Andrews rejects accusations of ‘retribution’ against state ICAC The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has rejected accusations that his government engaged in retribution in response to probes by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog. The Herald Sun reported on Thursday that the former head of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission accused the Andrews government of retaliation in response to the agency’s probes into its conduct. The allegations are contained in a letter Robert Redlich sent to the parliament lower house speaker and upper house president in December. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Andrews said he had not seen the letter: I absolutely reject any suggestion by him or anybody else that the government does not behave appropriately. I’m not having a debate with a bloke who used to run an agency and he’s apparently written a letter that I haven’t seen. Redlich claims that government MPs directed independent auditors to “find dirt” on the watchdog that was not publicly available. University of Sydney strikes continue Hundreds of University of Sydney staff and students are striking for a seventh day today, marking the longest-running campaign of work stoppages at an Australian university. Picket lines have been formed blocking access to campus in protest of university management’s rejection of the National Tertiary Education Union’s claims on a new enterprise bargaining agreement. The agreement has been in negotiations since August 2021. In its latest offer, the university put forward a 4.6% pay increase in 2023 plus an additional $2,000 sign-on payment and a reduction in its casual workforce of 20%. The president of the University of Sydney’s NTEU branch, Dr Nick Rimer, said the institution was “seriously threatening” staff rights at work. University managers have been responsible for spiralling overwork and relentless inefficiencies. They’re badly distracting us from our key responsibilities of education and research. Union members are trying to fix that. They want us to believe they’re the incarnation of generosity, but they’re making a miserly salary offer that is lower than far less wealthy institutions like the Australian Catholic University or Western Sydney University. That’s simply unacceptable. The university posted a $1.04bn surplus in 2021, the highest of any institution. Classes and laboratory sessions have been widely cancelled ahead of the strikes, the student union’s food outlets will be closed, and administration work – including on grant applications and results processing – will not be going ahead. The union has flagged further industrial action in March and May if its claims are unmet. In an email sent to staff on 21 February, the deputy vice-chancellor, Annamarie Jagose, said it had been in an “unnecessarily protracted bargaining round” and it recognised “maintaining our sector-leading salaries is critical if we are to continue to attract and retain the best people”. Since August 2021, the university has made a number of significant concessions in relation to its offer. Now that we have almost reached the end of the more than 100 claims put by the unions, I am confident that we have made a sector-leading offer that many colleagues will be impatient to accept. Liberal senator James Paterson had found his niche in opposition, railing about TikTok. To be fair, this was also his interest while in government – but it’s a lot easier to point out what should be done when your side isn’t the one with the power for the doing. So none of these things are new – it’s just that the shackles have been released. Safeguard mechanism negotiations still deadlocked The negotiations for the safeguard mechanism are still deadlocked, though. The Greens and David Pocock (the key votes needed for it – Lidia Thorpe has said she will vote with the Greens on climate issues) are not convinced it will really make a material change. Labor says it’s the first step and having a mechanism is important. Every commentator and their cat is talking about 2009. It could pop up in the next sitting, but there is a lot of work to be done before then. Amy’s analysis: who gets what out of the national reconstruction fund negotiations? Labor has always said the point of the NRF was to boost manufacturing and wouldn’t be used for coal or gas – but now it is explicit. The Greens wanted the amendment to stop any future governments from using the fund for fossil fuels. That doesn’t mean a future government couldn’t try to amend the legislation in the future if it really wanted to, but it would need the parliament to agree and also would have to publicise “we want to use this for fossil fuels”. So Ed Husic gets his fund; the Greens, who had a manufacturing policy for the election, get the spirit of that policy and a fossil fuel ban; and the Coalition, who were against it – putting the Greens in the bargaining seat – get to say the government is making deals with the Greens (which is the point of a lot of this “just say no” policy). The government has got the votes it needs for the national reconstruction fund: the Greens are on board after the government agreed to an amendment which means the fund can’t be used for coal and gas projects or for native forest logging. Adam Bandt: Coal and gas are the biggest cause of the climate crisis, so this is a big win for the climate and a big win for jobs and the economy. Coal and gas are out of the reconstruction fund, and native forest logging is too. We thank the government for the constructive approach they have taken in the negotiations and hope this can continue in the safeguard and housing bill discussions in the coming period. Clean energy investment positive but ‘Australia needs to do more’ The Clean Energy Council says data shows positive signs for the energy transition – but we also need to act faster. Year-to-year investment saw a 17% bump on 2021, with $6.2bn in 2022. The final quarter of 2022 saw investment in financially committed large-scale generation and storage projects reach $4.3bn, the highest quarterly investment since Q3 2018. Six generation and storage projects reached financial close, representing 1923 MW of new installed capacity and 800 MWh of storage. The council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said investors were responding to the new policy environment but it wasn’t yet the trend. The fact remains that the rolling quarterly average investment over 12 months has not risen above $2bn since the second quarter of 2019. The current policy settings are only going to get us so far, and it’s clear that with significant shifts in capital overseas through the United States Inflation Reduction Act and other responses from the likes of the European Union and the Gulf States, Australia needs to do more. The organisation wants to see the renewable energy target increased to boost that investment Coalition argues desired funding changes for referendums are about integrity The Coalition hasn’t agreed to vote for the Referendum Machineries Act – the legislation which updates how we hold referendums in this country, given we haven’t held one this century. So far, the Coalition is drawing a hard line over the funding. The argument is that it is not just for this referendum, but future ones. Here is what Simon Birmingham had to say this morning: I think that we should have formal yes and no committees and that those committees, as I said last time, should have some administrative or operational funding attached to them. That’s what we’re asking for. I don’t want to see large licks of taxpayer funds spent on big advertising campaigns – that’s for different parties to go out and raise themselves. But it is reasonable to expect to see that there are formal campaigns there, to ensure that the debate on the voice is an informed, structured debate that is subjected to all the same types of rules and regulations that we would also see during a normal election campaign. That’s actually about the integrity and the proper process of it and I hope that the government will consider that and those reasonable requests as it passes through the Senate. The thing is though, the parliament can amend legislation whenever it has the will. So this one piece of legislation doesn’t have to cover every referendum in the future – if there is a need to change it for another referendum, that is easy enough. The parliament sitting is about to begin and the house will open with the second reading debate for the national reconstruction fund. That’s Ed Husic’s baby, so expect a lot of words from him about that today. Bill Shorten was going to hold a doorstop (mini press conference) to acknowledge one million downloads of the myGov app (the one with the cringe Valentine social media posts), complete with cupcakes, but that has been cancelled. So I guess you can’t let them eat cake, after all. Some Melbourne hospitals experiencing IT outage Melbourne hospitals across the Eastern Health network are experiencing a “significant” IT system outage this morning. A “code yellow internal emergency” has been declared across the healthcare service which offers emergency, surgical, medical and general healthcare services, including maternity, and palliative care. Eastern Health said the caused was “a critical core switch outage” with no evidence of a cyber attack. In a statement issued shortly before 8am, Eastern Health said they were working to resolve the issue: Hospital systems have reverted to downtime procedures and business continuity plans have been enacted. We will continue to keep our staff, patients and healthcare partners informed as the situation unfolds. And we again thank our staff for the work they are doing to support the ongoing care of our community. Labor not surprised by RBA’s current approach on interest rates A little earlier, Katy Gallagher danced the line between “the RBA is independent” and also “we are happy to hear there is a pause in interest rate rises coming”. She told ABC Radio RN Breakfast: We’re all … watching and listening when the governor speaks. I think, from what I saw of his address and question-and-answer session … he was indicating that they’re going to continue to look as the data comes in and they make their decisions accordingly. So I don’t think that’s necessarily a surprise but … it’s something … we’d want the bank to be doing, I would suggest, because you know, when they making decisions, obviously those decisions impact on on all of us. So I didn’t see anything hugely surprising – [the bank will] read the data, [look at the] evidence and then make decisions about interest rates based on those. Birmingham: PM should push to raise issues on Ukraine invasion not just for humanitarian reasons but also economic ones Does Simon Birmingham think that Anthony Albanese should be raising issues about freedom of speech and Russia while he is with the Indian leader? Birmingham: Well, a couple of things there. Australia should always be consistent and predictable when it comes to our values. We have clear values in our country that we uphold in terms of the nature of our democracy, the freedom of the media, and the types of values that people should expect us to uphold to express and to do so quite consistently with any nation in the world. Critically, of course, we do wish to see the G20 used as a platform to try to continue to put pressure on Russia to cease the war in Ukraine. And so I would expect those matters to form part of discussions to make sure that we are attempting to send as strong a message as possible about not just the human toll that that war is inflicting, but also the economic toll on Europe and around the world as a consequence of that. And that’s part of the reason why the G 20, founded for particular economic purposes, has a role to play in sending a strong message as it can send to Russia. Coalition takes credit for India-Australia relationship’s ‘high point’ Liberal senator [and probably the Coalition’s best communicator] Simon Birmingham is on ABC Radio RN Breakfast this morning. He is happy Anthony Albanese is meeting with Narendra Modi and says the former government helped set the relationship up for expansion: Well, they have been drawing closer and closer in recent years. Under the previous government, we signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with India. We signed a new trade agreement with India just prior to Covid [I led, as] as then trade minister, the largest business delegation ever to India in terms of reaching across a whole range of sectors including, critically, the education sector that you just spoke of. And so I really welcome this mission by Prime Minister Albanese, he finds the India-Australia relationship at a high point and it’s an opportunity for him to drive that further in terms of our bilateral cooperation and critically, also building upon the areas of regional and global cooperation that we have also … strengthened so greatly in recent years through our partnership in the Quad and that are … at a key point this year within his chairmanship of the G20. And for a little more detail on what is about to be announced, our UK colleagues Kiran Stacey and Dan Sabbagh have this story: Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, the head of the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce, had a chat with Daniel Hurst: Australia will put nuclear safety ‘above all else’ as it begins the ‘generational challenge’ of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. Gallagher aware of funding issue on national partnership agreements A lot of funding in Australia is tied up in national partnership agreements. They are usually for short periods – the commonwealth works with the states to come to an agreement on funding, but it often means that agreements almost come to an end (or indeed, do end) and need emergency funding to continue while the next national partnership is worked out. That’s what happening for a lot of homelessness charities at the moment. They say they are going to be have to sack people, because the funding is about to run out. Katy Gallagher says that she is not hand balling it to the states and she is aware of the issue, but the agreement process is being worked out: That agreement, which this money flows through is part of the national housing and homelessness agreement. And we are in active negotiations with the states. I’m aware of the funding issue. This is, you know, to give appropriate remuneration funding for or funding for payment for staff and Julie Collins is working hard on it. I can’t give you an answer today because it is right literally on our table. Labor ‘determined to be responsible in terms of budget’ Are Katy Gallagher and Jim Chalmers looking for savings with more urgency than they were in October, given the economic circumstances? Gallagher: We certainly were aware of the inflation problem in October. So you saw that we were we had upside, revenue coming in to the budget that we banked that – I think it was 99% in the first two years and 94% of the upside revenue over the forward estimates. Now that was an important message, not just from the fact that we’re going to be fiscally responsible, but that where we can, you know, show restraint in spending. We will and so we will continue that in the May budget where we [are in the processes right now] so I can’t go to decisions that might be taken in in the future around it but I can honestly I can absolutely say to you that Jim and I are determined to be responsible in terms of budget, we’ve got a massive job to do and that will require showing restraint because of this inflation pressure within the economy. We don’t want to make it worse. We’re conscious of the fact that our spending, you know if we’re not mindful of it, that it could have an impact. And so we’re not we’re not putting ourselves in that position. Finance minister: ‘whole range of booby traps’ left by former government in budget The finance minister Katy Gallagher is on ABC Radio RN Breakfast this morning, where she will no doubt be asked about the franking credit changes. The Liberal senator Simon Birmingham will be up after Gallagher, so no doubt he will have plenty of things to say in response. Gallagher is asked about whether the government is looking at “escalating” savings in the budget, given inflation. We are certainly looking at how we can institute some budget repair. I mean, we’ve inherited a budget with massive deficits. There’s a $50bn structural deficit that exists in the budget every year. And we’ve got this massive debt that we’ve inherited as well. So we have this responsibility to manage the debt. Look at how we repair the budget over time and I guess the other pressure we’ve got is that the you know, and we’ve talked about this a lot, is the pressures coming towards the budget are increasing, not decreasing. So that requires us to have a look at current expenditure, where it is what the priorities are, where the some of that can be reprioritised into these new and emerging pressures. But also, there are areas where we can make sensible savings and I’m not going to pretend it is easy, it is not easy. You know we’ve got a whole range of booby traps that were left by the former government for us that we’re working through now … these list of terminating pressures on programs that aren’t terminating for a start, which certainly dressed up how the budget balance looked over time, but [masked] the reality of the funding pressures that were being faced on that budget so we’re dealing with a whole range of things, terminating measures, increasing pressures and are [looking for savings]. Franking credit fight The Coalition is sinking its teeth into Labor’s 2023 Treasury amendment bill, as it has suggested changes to franking credit buyback schemes. It has been referred to the Senate economics committee and Andrew Bragg is leading the charge in that chamber, calling the amendment “a dangerous and underhanded measure to stop the payment of franked dividends in Australia”. The Labor Party wants to destroy franking, by barring Australian companies which have raised capital from paying franked dividends. That will be most companies. If this was Labor’s intention, they should have been honest with Australians during the election. Instead, we were given emphatic reassurances from the Prime Minister and Treasurer they would not touch franking credits. Now we know these reassurances were not made in good faith. If legislated, these measures will result in grave consequences for the competitiveness of Australian companies. It will deter investment in Australian companies, making it harder for them to raise capital, and more reliant on debt. You can read the bill’s intention here. Just mentioning franking credits is enough to release the 2019 kraken, but it is a little ridiculous that there is no part of the tax system that can be put up for even modest reforms without immediate responses of HOW DARE YOU. Anthony Albanese is in India, so he will miss the last parliament sitting of the week. Richard Marles is acting PM. Question time remains a mess. You are up to date. As always, thank you to Martin for getting us started – we’ll switch over to politics and start the day. It’s going to be at least a four-coffee morning. Ready? ACT poll finds 63% oppose new coal and gas A majority of Canberrans support a ban on new coal and gas projects in federal law, Paul Karp reports. It’s adding pressure on the independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, to withhold support from Labor’s safeguard mechanism bill which aims to reduce industry greenhouse emissions but has been criticised for not doing enough to achieve that aim, by relying on carbon offsets instead of “real” emission reductions. The uComms poll of 1,112 residents of the Australian Capital Territory, commissioned by the Australia Institute, found 63% oppose new coal and gas, and 82% oppose the unlimited use of carbon credits to offset pollution. The release of the poll comes as the Albanese government prepares to stare down a 4pm Thursday deadline to respond to a Senate order for forecasts of how big industrial emitters would use carbon credits to meet obligations created by the safeguard mechanism.

Anthony Albanese will join the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at the stadium bearing his name, to celebrate “75 years of friendship through cricket” for a range of events before the match. Albanese and Modi will be taken through the India-Australia Platinum Hall of Fame within the stadium before the prime ministers meet the players. Australia’s captain Steve Smith and India’s skipper Rohit Sharma are expected to introduce all their players to both leaders before the national anthems are played. Albanese is expected to stay at the Ahmedabad colosseum for about an hour before moving on to other commitments in Mumbai and Delhi. According to reports, Modi will stay on to do some TV commentary about the match. Australian business leaders, including Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, Fortescue Metals boss Andrew Forrest and Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn, have joined Albanese on his first trip to India as prime minister. The final crowd figure will be a source of fascination, with up to 85,000 of the day one tickets in the 132,000-capacity stadium set aside for local families and students. The record attendance for a single day of Test cricket stands at 91,112 from the start of the 2013-14 Ashes battle at the MCG. After a near five-year rebuild, the stadium in the capital of the Indian state of Gujarat reopened in February 2020. The first event there was a political event when Donald Trump arrived in India, with the former US president infamously mispronouncing the names of cricket icons Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli during a speech. A study published in the journal Nature has found that smoke from the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires temporarily depleted the ozone layer by 3% to 5% in 2020. Particles in bushfire smoke can activate molecules that destroy the ozone layer, according to research that suggests future ozone recovery may be delayed by increasingly intense and frequent fires. Smoke from the 2019-20 bushfires, which circulated around the globe, was ejected into the stratosphere, the second layer in Earth’s atmosphere, by a pyrocumulonimbus cloud. Read Donna Lu’s full story here: Morning, and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you a few of the top stories breaking overnight and likely to make news today before Amy Remeikis takes charge. Anthony Albanese will join his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to celebrate “75 years of friendship through cricket” as the two countries’ men’s teams take each other on in the fourth Test in Ahmedabad today. Albanese is expected to stay at the stadium for about an hour before moving on to other commitments in Mumbai and Delhi, although Modi will reportedly do some TV commentary about the match – which could set a world attendance record of 110,000, surpassing the current record holder, the MCG. Lidia Thorpe, the independent senator, has said she is shocked that Warren Mundine’s Conservative Political Action Conference Australia has used her image in their advertising against the voice to parliament. Although she stood down from the Greens to campaign for a sovereignty treaty, she has not ruled out backing the yes campaign. So she was angered when she saw her picture. “There’s no consent, no permission,” she said, adding that using the picture, in which she is wearing face paint applied by an elder, shows that CPAC is disrespecting the “protocols of the elder”. The former head of the independent watchdog tasked with investigating the department responsible for the robodebt program will be questioned by the royal commission today. Richard Glenn served as acting commonwealth ombudsman in 2017 when an investigation into the human services department took place. His appearance follows that of former senior assistant ombudsman Louise Macleod, who broke down when she told the commission of her failure to convince her superiors to publish her legal criticisms of the robodebt scheme.

We are closing this blog and will be continuing our rolling live news from Turkey and Syria in a new one, which you can find here. Turkey’s disaster agency has raised the death toll from the earhtquake again, Reuters reports. In Turkey, the figures now stand at 6,234 killed. The number of those injured there rose to 37,011, the agency said, adding that more than 79,000 personnel were engaged in search and rescue operations mo the Turkish side of the border. With Syria’s death toll climbing to 2,470, the combined number of people killed in the disaster currently stands at 8,704, and is exopected to contiune to rise throughout the day.

This girl was rescued after being trapped for 40 hours in Salqin, Idlib: Here are some of this morning’s photos: I’m Helen Sullivan and if you’re just joining us, here is where things stand at the moment. If you’d like to get in touch, you can find me here. It is nearing 10am in Turkey. The latest death toll from Monday’s catastrophic earthquake stands at 8,364. On Wednesday morning, AFP reported that Syria’s toll had climbed to 2,470. At least 5,894 have died in Turkey, bringing the overall lives lost in both countries so far to 7,926. The numbers are expected to increase “significantly”, Syria’s White Helmets said. More than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres. On Tuesday afternoon, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared a disaster zone in the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. The ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation. Turkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said. Three British nationals are missing after the earthquake, the UK’s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. “We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,” James Cleverly said. Four Australians are unaccounted for following the earthquakes. Australia’s foreign affairs department is providing consular assistance to the families of the nationals who were where the catastrophe struck and to about 40 other Australians and their families who were also in the area.

Monday’s magnitude 7.8 quake, followed hours later by a second quake almost as powerful, toppled thousands of buildings including hospitals, schools and apartment blocks, injuring tens of thousands, leaving countless numbers homeless across Turkey and Syria. Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. But residents in several damaged cities voiced anger and despair over the response by authorities to the deadliest earthquake to hit Turkey in decades. “There is not even a single person here. We are under the snow, without a home, without anything,” Murat Alinak, whose home in Malatya collapsed and whose relatives are missing, told Reuters. “What shall I do, where can I go?” The number of people confirmed dead in Syria stands at 2,470 AFP reports. This brings the number of people confirmed dead from Turkey and Syria to 8,364. Turkey’s official toll remains unchanged for now at 5,894.

This account of the earthquake from Syria, relayed to my colleague Mostafa Rachwani by Mohamad Kazmooz, is worth reading in full. Here is how it begins: For the past two days, I have lived what has felt like an impossible nightmare. At 4am on Monday, at our home in Idlib in north-west Syria, we were violently shaken awake by an extremely powerful earthquake. It was a terror unlike any that I can describe, our home was shaking, our belongings were being tossed to the ground, screens were falling and shattering, pieces of the walls and chunks of the building collapsed. In that moment, I did not think we would survive. I live with my wife and parents, and we were all violently woken up by this nightmare. China’s earthquake rescue team, which has arrived in Turkey, is comprised of 82 members, brought 20 tonnes of medical and other rescue supplies and equipment, as well as four search-and-rescue dogs, according to CCTV. The team will cooperate with the local government, the embassy in Turkey, the United Nations and other agencies on missions, including setting up a temporary command, carrying out personnel search and rescue and providing medical aid, CCTV said. Separately, civil society rescue teams with at least 52 members from several provinces in China including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Guangdong are heading to the earthquake-stricken areas in Turkey to carry out the rescue work, CCTV reported. China has already committed to give a first tranche of 40 million yuan ($5.9 million) in emergency aid to Turkey. These satellite images released by Maxar Technologies give an idea of the scale of the challenge for emergency crews over the coming days. They show in vivid detail the breadth of the destruction that has unfolded in towns, cities and villages across the region: A woman named Nurgul Atay told the Associated Press she could hear her mother’s voice beneath the rubble of a collapsed building in the Turkish city of Antakya, the capital of Hatay province. But rescuers did not have the heavy equipment needed to rescue her. “If only we could lift the concrete slab, we’d be able to reach her,” she said. “My mother is 70 years old, she won’t be able to withstand this for long.” Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said 1,647 people were killed in Hatay alone, the highest toll of any Turkish province. At least 1,846 people had been rescued there as of Tuesday evening, he said. Hatay’s airport was closed after the quake destroyed the runway, complicating rescue efforts. Here is a video of a man who appears to be part of a rescue crew offering a hard-working rescue dog some of his water, then freshening up his fur: “People revolted (on Tuesday) morning. The police had to intervene,” a man named Celal Deniz, 61, told AFP in Gaziantep. His brother and nephews remain trapped under rubble. “Where have all our taxes gone, collected since 1999?” He was referring to a levy dubbed “the earthquake tax” that was implemented after a massive earthquake destroyed large parts of northwestern Turkey and killed 17,400 people, The revenues – now estimated to be worth 88bn liras, or $4.6bn – were meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services. But how this money was actually spent is not publicly known. If there aren’t enough rescuers, volunteers say they will have to step in and do the hard work themselves. Here is another scene reported by AFP, showing people’s anger at how long it has taken rescue teams to arrive: With every passing moment, Ebru Firat knows the chances dim of finding her cousin alive under the rubble of a flattened building in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep. And with that fading hope, the 23-year-old’s grief is being replaced by rage at the government’s earthquake response. “I have no more tears left to cry,” she said. Despite the importance of every minute, no rescue team arrived at the scene in the critical first 12 hours after the disaster, forcing victims’ relatives and local police to clear the ruins by hand, witnesses said. And when the rescuers finally came on Monday evening, they only worked for a few hours before breaking for the night, residents told AFP. Syria’s White Helmets say that the death toll in rebel-held northwest Syria now stands at 1,220, from 1,000 a few hours ago. With the 812 people confirmed dead in government-held areas, this brings the total known toll in Syria to 2032. At least 5,894 have died in Turkey, bringing the overall lives lost in both countries so far to 7,926. The numbers are expected to increase “significantly”, the White Helmets said. On Wednesday, Dave O’Neill, leader of a British emergency service rescue team, told AFP that the coming hours will be “absolutely critical” in the scramble through the quake debris. “That is why we are so keen to get to work as fast as we can to make the most of the rescue window in front of us,” he said shortly after the 77-person British squad arrived at Gaziantep airport. The team just wanted to “get out as quickly as possible,” he said. “We have search teams and dogs. We need to get out there and establish our base and link up with the other teams.” AFP has this report from Gaziantep’s airport, which has turned into a place for people to sleep amid a flurry of arrivals of rescuers from Turkey and around the world. Turkey’s Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has warned the next 48 hours would be “crucial” in the hunt for survivors, with temperatures barely above freezing. With survivors scared to return to their homes after the devastating 7.8 magnitude tremor, the airport has become a refuge for many. About 100 people wrapped in blankets slept in one lounge of the terminal normally used to welcome Turkish politicians and celebrities. Local authorities have banned people from staying in apartment blocks because of the many aftershocks hitting the region. Mustafa Ehianci, a 20-year-old student, was among those huddled in the airport’s VIP lounge, with five other members of his family. He said he had been asleep when the first tremor hit on Monday. “It was like a bad dream, a roller coaster,” he recalled. “We were waiting outside when the second quake struck a few hours later. Now we are all terrified,” Ehianci told AFP. “We are sleeping here, eating here. We are safe in this area, there is electricity and sewage. “I don’t know when we will leave.” An earthquake rescue team dispatched by China’s government arrived in Turkey’s Adana Airport early on Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Wednesday. The team, comprised of 82 members, brought 20 tonnes of medical and other rescue supplies and equipment, as well as four search-and-rescue dogs, according to CCTV. The team will cooperate with the local government, the embassy in Turkey, the United Nations and other agencies on missions, including setting up a temporary command, carrying out personnel search and rescue and providing medical aid, CCTV said. A lot of bleak news today, so it’s worth taking a moment to watch this video made by Mexico’s rescue envoy of its four-legged team members: The United States has announced that it was sending two rescue teams to NATO ally Turkey. Allen said the teams would arrive Wednesday morning and head to the city of Adiyaman, where search efforts have so far been limited. The teams, coming on two C-130 transport aircraft, are bringing 158 personnel, 12 dogs and 170,000 pounds (77,100 kilograms) of specialized equipment, he said. “What we’re focused on right now in Turkey is getting those teams out and saving lives, to put it bluntly,” Allen said from Ankara. “If they need further assistance when it comes to populations who may be without housing or need immediate assistance, we are certainly ready to provide that,” he said. The 7.8-magnitude earthquake has killed more than 7,100 people in the two countries, according to officials and medics. More now on how the US is approaching aid to Syria, given its refusal to normalise relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or offer any direct reconstruction aid, seeking accountability for abuses during the brutal nearly 12-year civil war. Assad has wrested back most of the country and over the past year has been restoring relations with other Arab nations as well as Turkey. Stephen Allen, who is leading the response on the ground for the US Agency for International Development, said that most of the damage was in areas not under Assad’s control and that USAID had local partners there. USAID is reorienting assistance that was already in place to help war-hit Syrians, instead focusing on rescue efforts and other immediate needs including providing shelter and food, Allen said. “We’ve got the full gamut of humanitarian response going in northwest Syria right now,” Allen told reporters. He declined to name the non-governmental groups working with the United States, citing operational security. The United States said Tuesday it was working with partners to provide earthquake relief in Syria but would stand firm against working with the Damascus government, AFP reports. The United States also said it expected to send further assistance to Turkey after sending two rescue teams to the NATO ally, which suffered heavily as well in Sunday’s earthquake. “In Syria itself we have US-funded humanitarian partners that are coordinating lifesaving assistance,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters as he met his Austrian counterpart. “We’re committed to providing that assistance to help people in Syria recover from this disaster, just as we have been their leading humanitarian donor since the start of the war in Syria itself,” Blinken said. “I want to emphasize here that these funds, of course, go to the Syrian people -- not to the regime. That won’t change.” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent condolences to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday, citing the North’s state media. This aerial video from Reuters gives an idea of the scale of destruction in Hatay, Turkey, with entire multi-storey buildings lying collapsed in the roads. On Tuesday in the town of Jinderis, in the opposition-held zone on the Syrian province of Idlib, a toddler was pulled alive from the wreckage of a collapsed building. Video from the White Helmets, the emergency service in the region, shows a rescuer digging through crushed concrete amid twisted metal until the little girl, named Nour, appeared. The girl, still half buried, looks up dazedly as they tell her, “Dad is here, don’t be scared. … Talk to your dad, talk.” A rescuer cradled her head in his hands and tenderly wiped dust from around her eyes before she was pulled out. The quake has wreaked new devastation in the opposition-held zone, centered on the Syrian province of Idlib, which was already been battered by years of war and strained by the influx of displaced people from the country’s civil war, which began in 2011. Monday’s earthquake killed hundreds across the area, and the toll was continually mounting with hundreds believed still lost under the rubble. The quake completely or partially toppled more than 730 buildings and damaged thousands more in the territory, according to the White Helmets, as the area’s civil defense is known. The Economist has spoken to Ovgun Ahmet Ercan, an earthquake expert, who estimates that “180,000 people or more may be trapped under the rubble, nearly all of them dead.” The Guardian has not independently verified this figure. The UN said yesterday that it feared the toll could reach 20,000, a staggering number and much lower than this estimate. The Turkish provinces impacted by the quake are home to 13 million people. For comparison, almost 230,000 people died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. 17,000 died in the 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Reuters has this short story of a single Hatay street almost totally levelled by the earthquakes: Street no. 21 in Hatay, Turkey was, on Sunday, a happy home for dozens of families. By Monday, there was hardly anything left of it. Hardly a building was left standing. Doors, roofs and windows lay scattered. Injured people were pulled out of the remains of what once were homes. Many people stood in silence, staring in disbelief. “Words are sticking in my throat. Crying is no longer a remedy,” said Halil Gencoglu on Tuesday, fighting back tears. Abdulkadir Dogan had already lost his parents in the earthquake and was still hoping to find his cousin alive. “We want to rescue our wives, relatives and friends who are stuck. They are our priority because we are trying to cling to life with them... My cousin is stranded there and I am here and I can do nothing,” he said. A short while ago, a two-year-old girl and her mother were rescued after 44 hours trapped under rubble in Hatay, Turkey. This is a very brave Vafe Sabha: Hi, my name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest from Turkey and Syria for the next few hours. If you have questions, news you think we may have missed or just want to get in touch, you’ll find me on Twitter here. The latest death toll from Monday’s catastrophic earthquake has passed 7,800. In Turkey, 5,894 people are confirmed to have been killed, while 1,932 people have died in Syria for a combined total of 7,826 fatalities. As the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. Initial rescue efforts were stalled by a second quake on Monday that measured 7.7 magnitude. Adelheid Marschang, a WHO senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, are likely to be affected by the quake. More than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres. Tuesday afternoon, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared a disaster zone for the 10 provinces affected by the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Turkey’s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation. Turkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise with the arrival of additional people, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said. Three British nationals are missing following the earthquake that struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, the UK’s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. “We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,” James Cleverly said. A plane carrying 77 UK search and rescue specialists, state-of-the-art equipment and four search dogs has landed in Gaziantep in south-east Turkey, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. The team, made up of firefighters and staff from 14 fire and rescue services from across the country, will cut their way into buildings and help locate survivors in the rubble of the earthquakes. At least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State (IS) in north-west Syria in the aftermath of yesterday’s earthquakes, according to local media and Agence France-Presse. The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes. Aid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, a UN spokesperson said on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war. Syria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under Syrian government control. The dispute over the control of the aid is hampering efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing. The UN’s cultural agency Unesco said on Tuesday it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its world heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage in the devastating earthquake. As well as the damage to the old city of Syria’s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakır, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected. A newborn baby girl has been pulled alive from the rubble of a home in northern Syria, after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday’s massive earthquake. The infant is the sole survivor of her immediate family, the rest of whom were all killed when the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Syria and neighbouring Turkey flattened the family home in the rebel-held town of Jindayris, said relative Khalil al-Suwadi. “We heard a voice while we were digging,” Suwadi told AFP on Tuesday. “We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord (intact) so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.” The latest death toll from Monday’s catastrophic earthquake has passed 7,800. In Turkey, 5,894 people are confirmed to have been killed, while 1,932 people have died in Syria for a combined total of 7,826 fatalities. There are fears that the toll will rise inexorably, with World Health Organization officials estimating up to 20,000 may have died. Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region has said it has resumed oil exports through Turkey, after suspending them as a precaution following Monday’s deadly earthquake. “At 9:45 pm (1845 GMT) the Kurdistan region’s oil exports resumed via the pipeline connecting the area with Turkey,” the Kurdish ministry of natural resources said in a statement. The northern region usually exports around 450,000 barrels of oil a day through Turkey, and has continued to pump oil out of the country despite the federal authorities demanding a halt to the trade. On one side of Syria’s civil war, a man in army fatigues carried a lifeless child’s ashen body from the rubble of a shattered building in the government-held city of Hama. Across a frontline on another side of Syria, a rescue worker in the white helmet and black-yellow vest of the Syrian civil defence carried a young girl - shaken but alive - from the rubble of her home in rebel-held Azaz. Both witnessed by Reuters journalists, the scenes that unfolded in the hours after an earthquake devastated Syria and Turkey on Monday were similar, though the uniforms clearly located the rescuers on opposing sides of the conflict that has splintered the country. “The earthquake shook opposition held and regime-held areas, and I support the Syrian revolution with all my heart, but I care for my people,” Ramadan Suleiman, 28, said by phone, expressing sympathy for civilians living in government areas. “I’m a human, they’re human, we felt for those in Turkey and feel the same when it happens in other places like Europe. That’s humanity,” said Suleiman, who was displaced to Idlib from Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria during the war. “This is the last thing that the country needed. It’s a country that is inhabited by death,” said Hassan Hussein, from the coastal city and government stronghold of Tartous. Three British nationals remain missing following the earthquake. Foreign secretary James Cleverley said the department’s Crisis Response Hub is working to support at least 35 Britons caught up in the disaster. He added: “We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low.” A number of relief organisations have urged the public to dig deep and donate, saying the help they are able to provide over the next few days “will save lives”. James Denselow, UK head of conflict and humanitarian advocacy for Save the Children UK, told the PA news agency: “The scale of this earthquake, in terms of not just strength but the kind of actual absolute sprawl of it has meant that we’ve had to spend a lot of time in this first phase checking in on needs, checking in on what is working logistically, checking that all our people are OK. “Because you’ve got airports out of action, hospitals collapsed, clinics collapsed, all the sort of places we would normally use are not necessarily accessible.” Two US Agency for International Development teams will arrive Wednesday morning in Turkey and will head to the southeastern province of Adiyaman to focus on urban search and rescue following earthquakes that killed more than 6,300 people and left a trail of destruction in Turkey and neighboring Syria. USAID’s disaster assistance response team leader for the earthquake response, Stephen Allen, told reporters on Tuesday the teams will be about 80 people each and also bring 12 dogs and 170,000 pounds of specialised tools and equipment, including for triage and concrete breaking, Reuters reports. The U.S. military aircraft carrying the teams and equipment were to land at Incirlik Air Base in the southern Turkish province of Adana and deploy immediately to hard-hit urban centers to save as many people as possible, Allen said. “They really do work 24/7, they work in shifts, they go around the clock, because every hour does count in the first few days,” Allen said. The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, “pledged the UK’s steadfast support” to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a phone call following a devastating earthquake affecting the Turkish president’s country and neighbouring Syria, No 10 said. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “Prime minister, Rishi Sunak, spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan this afternoon, following the devastating earthquakes which struck Turkiye (Turkey) and Syria. “He expressed his deep condolences for the tragic loss of life and pledged the UK’s steadfast support. “The prime minister confirmed that a 77-strong British search and rescue team arrived in Gaziantep today with specialist equipment and dogs, in response to a request from the Turkish government, and will immediately start work assisting with the rescue effort. “President Erdogan thanked the prime minister for the UK’s solidarity in response to this tragedy and welcomed international search and rescue and medical support for the initial emergency response. “The prime minister also noted the deeply concerning humanitarian situation over the border in north-west Syria, where Turkiye plays an important co-ordinating role, and set out how the UK has increased support to aid organisations and emergency responders.” German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, promised Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan further comprehensive support in dealing with the earthquake disaster, a spokesman for the German government said after the two leaders spoke on the phone. The number of people who have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to 7,266. It comes after the Turkish health minister confirmed 5,434 people were killed in the country alone. On the edge of Göksun, empty buildings with their walls ripped open showed the power of the earthquake that devastated the town just a day earlier. Icicles dangled from cracked walls, where the force of the quake had torn homes open to reveal their contents, exposing the tiles and chairs that used to be a kitchen and now were left open to the freezing air. Elsewhere, whole houses had been turned to rubble. On Tuesday Göksun was a ghost town, just over 70 miles from the centre of the deadly earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people in Turkey and Syria and has left untold numbers trapped under the rubble. Most residents of Göksun had fled in the aftermath, as powerful aftershocks continued to shake their homes. Those who stayed were struggling to survive in temperatures that dropped well below zero, sheltering in their cars or around makeshift campfires and struggling to find water and food, fearing further tremors. King Charles has told President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that his “thoughts and special prayers” are with all those affected by the earthquakes in Turkey. He said: “My wife and I have been most shocked and profoundly saddened by the news of the devastating earthquakes in South East Turkiye (Turkey). I can only begin to imagine the scale of suffering and loss as a result of these dreadful tragedies and I particularly wanted to convey our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the families of all those who have lost their loved ones. “Our thoughts and special prayers are with everyone who has been affected by this appalling natural disaster, whether through injury or the destruction of their property, and also with the emergency services and those assisting in the rescue efforts.” A plane carrying 77 UK search and rescue specialists, state-of-the-art equipment and four search dogs has landed in Gaziantep in south-east Turkey, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. The team, made up of firefighters and staff from 14 fire and rescue services from across the country, will cut their way into buildings and help locate survivors in the rubble of the earthquakes. Their specialist equipment includes seismic listening devices, concrete cutting and breaking equipment and propping and shoring tools. An emergency medical team was also on the flight and will conduct a full assessment of the situation on the ground, according to the FCDO. Aftershocks, freezing temperatures and damaged roads are hampering efforts to tackle the enormous humanitarian emergency triggered by Monday’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which has now killed more than 6,200 people and left 380,000 others seeking refuge in Turkey alone, writes Ruth Michaelson and Sam Jones. As the scale of the devastation from the initial quake – and a second, 7.7-magnitude tremor – became clearer, the Turkish authorities declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces and the World Health Organization warned that the number of fatalities could exceed 20,000. By Tuesday evening, the death toll in Turkey and Syria had passed 6,200. Turkey’s emergency management agency said more than 4,500 people had died and around 26,000 had been injured. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed past 800, with some 1,400 injured, according to the health ministry. In the rebel-held northwest of Syria, the White Helmets emergency rescue organisation said at least 900 people had died and more than 2,300 had been hurt. The ancient citadel of Aleppo suffered further damage in the earthquake that ravaged southern Turkey and northern Syria, a local architect and the Syrian antiquities directorate said. On Tuesday a pile of rubble near the citadel was all that was left of a structure identified by local architect Mohammed al-Rifaei as the “sheep tower”, which he said had stood there until the devastating early morning quake. “We had repeatedly asked for the restoration of the tower, but now it needs to be rebuilt from scratch,” Rifaei said. Syria’s Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums said parts of the citadel had suffered minor to moderate damage. Parts of an Ottoman-era mill had collapsed, walls had cracked and some of the dome of a mosque’s minaret had fallen off, Reuters reports. The citadel, listed by the UN cultural agency Unesco as a world heritage site, was significantly damaged in a long-running battle between government and rebel forces before it reopened in 2018. Syrian foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, has asked European countries to send aid following the earthquake, saying that sanctions are no excuse not to, he told Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen TV on Tuesday. Syrian officials have long argued that western sanctions have harmed reconstruction efforts in areas where the 12-year conflict has subsided, Reuters reports. The US and European nations have said that sanctions aim to pressure the Syrian government into a political process that could end the conflict. A 20-year-old student survived the earthquake in Turkey after posting a video to social media from underneath the rubble. The death toll has reached 6,000 with the search for survivors ongoing, according to the Associated Press. The Turkish defence ministry says the fire at Iskenderun Port on the Mediterranean Sea has been extinguished, Reuters reports. After the earthquake struck on Monday, images and videos showed burning containers and thick black smoke rising overhead. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey. Authorities in Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus have confirmed that reports of a group of high school students being rescued from the rubble of a hotel in the southeastern city of Adiyaman are incorrect. “I have just spoken to the mother of one of them and can confirm that neither her child nor any other has been found,” Sener Elcil, former head of the breakaway state’s teachers union told the Guardian. Members of a school volleyball team, the students were in the city to compete in a tournament when the devastating earthquake struck. “While some educators and the parents who were with them managed to escape the hotel, the children were trapped and no one has so far been pulled out of the building,” he said. Sener, who headed the union until last year and is helping coordinate rescue efforts with the school, said other groups of Turkish Cypriot school children were also in Turkey when the 7.8- magnitude quake hit “which explains the confusion.” The territory, which has only been recognised by Ankara since declaring independence in 1983, has strong ties with Turkey. “One of the groups [also staying in Adiyaman] managed to come back but is not the volleyball group,” he added. “Today we sent [mobile phone] power banks and coats to the teachers and parents who got out of the hotel because the temperatures are freezing and they had no way of communicating with us. They have stayed on because they want to help in the rescue efforts.” Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tartar, who has had oversight of the rescue efforts, has reportedly dispatched a 100-strong rescue team to the hotel and has vowed to follow up with new missions daily in a bid to help overstretched rescue operations currently underway. The island’s outgoing president Nicos Anastasiades tweeted today that Cyprus was ready to “contribute and offer our assistance to the humanitarian, rescue and recovery efforts.” Foreign ministry officials said the offer had been rebuffed by Turkey. In the wake of the 1974 Turkish invasion, following a right-wing coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece, Ankara has refused to extend diplomatic recognition to Cyprus. We have removed a previous post which said that the 24 junior Turkish Cypriot high school students were found because it was later found to be incorrect. Reuters reports that Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call to offer condolences and support after the deadly earthquake, Egypt’s presidency said in a statement on Tuesday. It is quarter past 7pm in Ankara and Damascus. Here is a summary of the latest situation in Turkey and Syria after yesterday’s earthquake and aftershocks. Aftershocks, freezing temperatures and damaged roads are hampering efforts to reach and rescue those affected by Monday’s earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which has killed more than 5,000 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. As the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. Initial rescue efforts were stalled by a second quake on Monday that measured 7.7 magnitude. Adelheid Marschang, a WHO senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, are likely to be affected by the quake. The number of confirmed deaths in both Turkey and Syria now stands at 5,261, with the expectation that numbers will continue to rise, according to Reuters. The death toll in the rebel-held north-west of Syria has been raised to 900. More than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres. Tuesday afternoon, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared a disaster zone for the 10 provinces affected by the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.

As well as the damage to the old city of Syria’s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakır, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected. A fire at the port of İskenderun on the Mediterranean Sea continues for the second day. Television images showed thick black smoke rising from burning containers which had toppled when the quake struck on Monday. Police in Turkey said on Tuesday they had detained four people over “provocative” social media posts. The four individuals were detained after officers found accounts that shared “provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic”, the police said. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said his government was working to send support to those affected by the “incredibly tragic situation” in Turkey and Syria “as quickly as possible”. Sunak said: It’s obviously an incredibly tragic situation that we’re all seeing in Turkey and Syria. I want everyone to know that we are doing what we can to provide support, we are in touch with the authorities in both Syria and Turkey. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, told MPs he had already authorised the deployment of a medical assessment team to respond to the earthquake, adding: The further stages of requirement will evolve over time, we will of course work closely with our international partners to make sure we address that. Videos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 5,000 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks collapsing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a castle that had stood for almost two millennia. But few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmaraş, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.

We are all in shock. I walked through a small area of Gaziantep on Tuesday morning. Damage is everywhere – cracked buildings, plaster, broken glass, some buildings have fallen. Each of these buildings represents hundreds of people who are now homeless. I saw dozens of cars with people or even whole families sleeping in them. Temperatures were freezing last night, below 30F [-1C]. Their batteries, their gas, it will not last. I’m American and have been living and teaching in Gaziantep for the past seven years. I woke up at 4.17am when the first earthquake hit. We do get occasional earthquakes but this one was clearly many orders of magnitude worse. And it just did not stop. I live on the third floor of an old five-storey concrete building, and I was expecting it to collapse. My windows were shoved open, and I could hear glass shattering in the hall as people came running out of their apartments and outside, pretty much as soon as they could, which was not the wisest thing to do, but – you panic. Read more here: Aid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, a UN spokesperson said on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war. The cross-border aid operation overseen by the UN since 2014 has been crucial to Syrians who fled President Bashar al-Assad’s rule during the conflict, bypassing the territory he controls. Now, however, there is no clear picture of when the aid, on which some 4 million people depend, would resume, Madevi Sun-Suon, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA), told Reuters. Sun-Suon said: Some roads are broken, some are inaccessible. There are logistical issues that need to be worked through. We are exploring all avenues to reach people in need. One avenue includes delivering aid via government-held territory, a process involving crossing frontlines through which aid has seldom passed during the war. Damascus has long opposed the humanitarian operation that has delivered aid into Syria from Turkey, saying assistance should be delivered via Damascus. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey. Reuters has a quick snap to say that the death toll in the rebel-held north-west of Syria has been raised to 900. Earlier today it was given as 790, with a warning that it would “dramatically” rise. The total death toll in both Turkey and Syria now stands at 5,261, with the expectation that numbers will continue to rise. At least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State (IS) in north-west Syria in the aftermath of yesterday’s earthquakes, according to local media and Agence France-Presse. The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes. The jail, run by Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters, houses about 2,000 inmates. About 1,300 are suspected IS fighters, and most of the rest of the population are suspected to be members of the US-backed Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). All 20 who escaped were believed to be IS, the source told AFP. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said it could not verify whether prisoners had escaped, but confirmed there was a mutiny in which guards lost control of parts of the prison. Most suspected members of IS captured in Syria are held in facilities under the oversight of Kurdish forces in Syria’s north-east, which was not as badly affected by Monday’s deadly earthquake and aftershocks. There have been a number of attempted outbreaks in the past, but most have been unsuccessful. The group lost control of the last slivers of its territory across Syria and Iraq in 2019 after a five-year US-led fight to destroy the jihadists’ “caliphate”. Cells affiliated to IS have continued to operate since in both countries. More than 8,000 people so far have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, said the Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay. About 380,000 people have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, with others huddling in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centres. Associated Press reports that many people have posted to social media to plead for assistance for loved ones believed to be trapped under rubble, with Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency quoting interior ministry officials as saying that all calls were being “collected meticulously” and the information relayed to search teams. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said 13 million people among the country’s population of 85 million were affected in some way. He has declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces in order to manage the response. Turkey said it would only allow vehicles carrying aid to enter the worst-hit provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Adıyaman and Hatay in order to speed the effort. Turkey has large numbers of troops in the border region with Syria and has tasked the military to aid in the rescue efforts, including setting up tents for the homeless and a field hospital in Hatay province. The defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said a humanitarian aid brigade based in Ankara and eight military search and rescue teams had also been deployed. UK for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has launched an urgent appeal in response to earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. In a press release it said that in Syria the organisation was already distributing emergency supplies, such as high-thermal blankets, mattresses and other lifesaving items, and was working to mobilise additional supplies for the region. Emma Cherniavsky, chief executive of UK for UNHCR, said: “Thousands of people’s lives were devastated in one night when the first of these terrible earthquakes struck. Many families who had previously fled from conflict in Syria were already struggling to cope with the cold winter, and now are facing this new crisis. “UNHCR is already working to help people affected by these earthquakes and assessing what more needs to be done. Every donation will help us to deliver essential aid to the people affected.” The appeal can be found here. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Syria and Turkey. Qatar has been preparing a shipment of aid at Al Udeid airbase. The country said it would send 120 rescue workers to Turkey, alongside “a field hospital, relief aid, tents and winter supplies.” Earlier, during a televised address Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan thanked Qatar for offering 10,000 container homes for people left homeless. The southern Turkish port of Iskenderun has suffered severe structural damage due to an earthquake, with all operations halted until further notice, the container shipping firm AP Moller Maersk said on Tuesday. Reuters reports that Maersk said in an advisory that it was not yet clear when the port would return to normal operations. “Given the situation at Iskenderun, we will need to perform a change of destination for all bookings bound for the port or already on the water,” it said. “We are currently planning to divert containers to nearby hubs within operational feasibility or hold at transshipment ports – including the Port of Mersin [in Turkey] and Port Said [in Egypt].” A fire has been burning in the post since yesterday, when containers that had been dislodged by the quake broke into flames. Andrew Lee, professor of public health at the University of Sheffield, has commented on the complexity involved in mounting search and rescue operations, saying: “Earthquake disasters are complex emergencies, with widespread impacts on society, infrastructure, local economies, health, education and other sectors. “The full scale of the disaster will not be clear for a few days yet, and the total number of casualties will probably increase. The risk of further aftershocks remains, and damaged buildings pose a further hazard. “The consequences are not just short term but are also longer term, such as through mental health effects (eg post-traumatic stress disorder) and the need for rehabilitation for those disabled by earthquake related injuries. The recovery from such disasters often takes many months and years afterwards.” Lee makes an important additional point: “What we see in the media is only a small snapshot, and we usually won’t see affected populations and areas away from the major urban centres that media teams don’t get to.” It will be particularly challenging to report from the north-west of Syria for example, and the World Health Organization has today again warned that it is concerned about the regions where little news has filtered back through. In Geneva, Unicef spokesperson James Elder has told reporters: “The earthquakes … may have killed thousands of children.” While verified numbers were not yet available, Reuters reports he said “we know that scores of schools, hospitals and other medical and educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed by the quakes, vastly impacting children”. Calling the quake the most powerful to hit the region in almost 100 years, Elder said Syrian refugees in northwest Syrian and in Turkey were among the most vulnerable. The World Health Organisation had earlier warned that the total casualty figures could exceed 20,000. A quake of a similar magnitude in the region in 1999 killed at least 17,000 people. Three British nationals are missing following the earthquake that struck south-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, the UK’s foreign secretary has said. Making a statement in the House of Commons in London, James Cleverly said: “As of this morning, we know that three British nationals are missing and the Foreign Office’s Crisis Response Hub is working to support the at least 35 British nationals who have been directly affected by these earthquakes. “We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low.” Armenia’s foreign minister says his country has offered to help Syria and Turkey in their response to the deadly quake, despite difficult relations between Yerevan and Ankara. Associated Press reports Ararat Mirzoyan told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that Armenia is prepared to send aid and rescue teams to both countries, but did not immediately say whether the offers had been accepted. Mirzoyan recalled that Armenia experienced a devastating earthquake in 1988 and required international assistance at the time. Reuters reports that Turkish authorities say about 13.5 million people have been affected by the quake. It says the impact has been felt in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakır in the east, and 300 km (185 miles) from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south. Syrian authorities have reported deaths as far south as Hama, about 100 km (60 miles) from the epicentre of Monday’s early morning quake. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has declared as a disaster zone the 10 provinces affected by the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months. In a speech, Reuters reports that the Turkish president said on Tuesday that 70 countries had offered help in search and rescue operations and that Turkey planned to open up hotels in the tourism hub of Antalya, to the west, to temporarily house people affected. He said the death toll in Turkey had risen to 3,549 people, raising the combined death toll in Turkey and Syria to 5,151. It is 3pm in Ankara and Damascus. Here is a summary of the latest situation in Turkey and Syria after yesterday’s earthquake and aftershocks. Aftershocks, freezing temperatures and damaged roads are hampering efforts to reach and rescue those affected by Monday’s earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which has killed more than 5,000 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. As the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. Initial rescue efforts were stalled by a second quake on Monday that measured 7.7 magnitude. Adelheid Marschang, a WHO senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, are likely to be affected by the quake. On Tuesday morning, Turkey’s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said 3,419 people had been killed in the quake, with another 20,534 had been injured. The number of confirmed deaths in Syria rose to 1,602, bringing the death toll in both countries to 5,021. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. Turkey’s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation. Turkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area. The number of personnel was expected to rise with the arrival of additional people, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said. Syria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under Syrian government control. The dispute over the control of the aid is hampering efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing. The UN’s cultural agency Unesco said on Tuesday it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its world heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage in the devastating earthquake. As well as the damage to the old city of Syria’s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakır, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected. A fire at the port of İskenderun on the Mediterranean Sea continues for the second day. Television images showed thick black smoke rising from burning containers which had toppled when the quake struck on Monday Police in Turkey said on Tuesday they had detained four people over “provocative” social media posts. The four individuals were detained after officers found accounts that shared “provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic”, the police said. The BBC reports Turkey’s ministry of transport and infrastructure said that overnight 3,400 people took shelter in trains being used as emergency accommodation. The UN’s cultural agency Unesco said on Tuesday it was ready to provide assistance after two sites listed on its world heritage list in Syria and Turkey sustained damage in the devastating earthquake. As well as the damage to the old city of Syria’s Aleppo and the fortress in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakır, Unesco said at least three other world heritage sites could be affected. “Our organisation will provide assistance within its mandate,” Agence France-Presse reports the Unesco director general, Audrey Azoulay, as having said. A statement from Unesco said it was “particularly concerned” about the old city of Aleppo, which has been on its list of world heritage in Danger since 2013 due to the Syrian civil war. “Significant damage has been noted in the citadel. The western tower of the old city wall has collapsed and several buildings in the souks have been weakened,” it said. In Turkey, Unesco said it was saddened by the “collapse of several buildings” at the world heritage site of the Diyarbakır fortress and the adjacent Hevsel gardens. It emphasised that the entire area was an important centre of the Roman, Sassanid, Byzantine, Islamic and Ottoman periods. Turkish and Kurdish communities in Germany have launched donation drives to send money, warm clothes and blankets to victims of the earthquake, Reuters reports. As news of the disaster spread and sparked frantic appeals for help, volunteers began collecting aid in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich for the thousands left injured or homeless after their homes were destroyed. Germany has about 2.3 million people of Turkish origin, the largest Turkish diaspora community in the world, according to the Turkish Community in Germany. Levent Cukur has coordinated an aid drive in the boxing gym he runs in Munich. “We didn’t expect it to go this crazy, it’s mad. We thought we would fill two vans and then send them off but it hasn’t stopped since 10 this morning.” As he spoke, a group of people were loading boxes of donations onto trucks. The first batch is scheduled to leave for Turkey on Thursday. “It is currently very cold in the affected regions and people urgently need blankets, warm clothing and boots,” said Tunca Karakas, a member of cultural association Tuerkisch-Deutscher Kreis. There is a little bit more detail on the status of Ghanaian football Christian Atsu. The vice-president of Hatayspor where Atsu plays said “Christian Atsu was pulled out injured. Our sporting director, Taner Savut, is unfortunately still under the rubble.” Read more here: Christian Atsu rescued injured from earthquake rubble in Turkey Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the news wires of the gathering international aid effort to provide assistance in Turkey and Syria. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, reports: Syria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under Syrian government control. The dispute over the control of the aid – along with the weather, destroyed roads and closed crossing points – is hampering aid efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing. Syria has been resistant to allowing aid into a region serving more than 4 million people because it regards the aid as undermining Syrian sovereignty and reducing its chances of winning back control of the region. “The areas worst affected by the earthquake inside Syria look to be run by the Turkish-controlled opposition and not by the Syrian government,” said Mark Lowcock, the former head of UN humanitarian affairs. “It is going to require Turkish acquiescence to get aid into those areas. It is unlikely the Syrian government will do much to help.” Read more here: Syria accused of playing politics with aid in aftermath of earthquake The Guardian community team want to hear from people in the region about the impact of the earthquake and how they have been affected.

Helena Smith reports for the Guardian from Athens: A team of Greek rescue workers, specialised in dealing with natural disasters, have arrived in Turkey’s Hatay region with sniffer dogs, doctors, nurses and a special fire-fighting vehicle. The 21-strong team, which flew in on a C-130 military plane, started pitching tents and getting to work this morning. “We are going to give it our best,” said team leader Dimitris Roumbas whose experience in search and rescue stretches back 25 years. “Just as we would work in our country, we will work in the country that is our neighbour. Our work is to free and save as many lives as possible.” The prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, instructed the mission be sent to Turkey within hours of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake strike. In a rare telephone call on Monday evening with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğa , he reiterated Athens’ “readiness to provide all further assistance necessary.” The search and rescue mission is likely to followed by many more, officials say. Greece was among the first countries to offer help to Turkey despite an historic rivalry that dates back decades over regional disputes. In December as bilateral tensions rose and the rhetoric became ever more inflammatory, Erdoğan threatened to strike Athens with short-range ballistic missiles, in a move that not only highlighted the degree to which ties had deteriorated, but the escalating threat of armed conflict in the eastern Mediterranean. In an about-turn that would have been inconceivable before the earthquake, the Turkish embassy in Athens chose to thank Greeks in a Greek-language tweet, writing “for your immediate response and messages of solidarity towards Turkey after the catastrophic earthquake that hit our country.” The assistance has evoked memories of the earthquake diplomacy that flourished – and helped ameliorate ties – in 1999 when both countries were also hit by devastating quakes within weeks of each other. In the UK, the development minister, Andrew Mitchell, has said that the UK’s contribution to the rescue effort was ready to leave for Turkey, but had been delayed as rescue teams globally were coordinated. Speaking on the GB News channel, Mitchell said “Britain is sending 76 people who specialise in getting people out of the rubble and four sniffer dogs, and also an emergency response team to see what more widely we can do to help. “The critical thing in these circumstances is the first 72 hours, these significant British assets are waiting to leave Birmingham, they were ready to leave last night. It’s been coordinated very professionally by the Turkish authorities. They will be leaving imminently. “And of course, they will be landing in daylight. And that is the time when they can be most effective. One of the things we learned from the Haiti earthquake over 10 years ago now was the importance of coordination and everyone not just rushing in. “It will land in daylight today, I hope, later this morning, and it will immediately hit the ground running. I hope that they will be able to save lives.” Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Barış Narlı in Ankara and Sam Jones recap the latest update for the Guardian: Dozens of powerful aftershocks continued to jolt southern Turkey and northern Syria on Tuesday, a day after an earthquake struck the region killing more than 5,000 people and destroying thousands of buildings, as difficult conditions, freezing temperatures and damaged roads hampered rescue efforts. As the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. On Tuesday morning, Turkey’s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said 3,419 people had been killed in the quake, with another 20,534 had been injured. The number of confirmed deaths on the Syrian side of the border rose to 1,602, bringing the death toll in both countries to 5,021. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed. People in remote towns in southern Turkey described how relief efforts were stretched to breaking point, amid destruction over a border region spanning almost 650 miles. In rebel-held northern Syria, volunteer rescue workers said they lacked some of the most basic fuel and other provisions required to pull those still trapped under the rubble of their homes. An unknown number of people remain trapped and efforts to find survivors have been frustrated by frigid conditions. Poor internet connections and damaged roads between some of the worst-hit cities in Turkey’s south, home to millions of people, also hindered rescue teams. Read more here: Difficult conditions frustrate rescue efforts after Turkey and Syria earthquakes as toll reaches 5,000 Adelheid Marschang, World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer, has said about 23 million people, including 1.4 million children, were likely to be exposed in both countries following the earthquake and its aftershocks that reduced thousands of buildings to rubble. Marschang said Turkey had a strong capacity to respond to the crisis but that the main unmet needs in the immediate and medium term would be across the border in Syria, already grappling with a years-long humanitarian crisis due to the civil war and a cholera outbreak. “This is a crisis on top of multiple crises in the affected region,” she said at the organisation’s board meeting in Geneva. “All over Syria, the needs are the highest after nearly 12 years of protracted, complex crisis, while humanitarian funding continues to decline.” The WHO said it was dispatching emergency supplies, including trauma and emergency surgical kits, and activating a network of emergency medical teams. “It’s now a race against time,” said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every minute, every hour that passes, the chances of finding survivors alive diminishes.” He said the WHO was especially concerned about areas of Turkey and Syria from where no information had emerged since Monday’s earthquake. “Damage mapping is one way to understand where we need to focus our attention,” he said. The flow of critical United Nations aid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily halted due to damage to roads and other logistical issues related to the deadly earthquake that struck the two countries on Monday, a UN spokesperson said. “Some roads are broken, some are inaccessible. There are logistical issues that need to be worked through,” Madevi Sun-Suon, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told Reuters. “We don’t have a clear picture of when it will resume,” she said. The Ghana Football Association says former Chelsea and Newcastle forward Christian Atsu has been rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey. The GFA says Atsu is receiving treatment but didn’t give details of any injuries, Associated Press reports. The Ghana international plays for Turkish club Hatayspor. His condition had been unconfirmed overnight. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from the regions affected by the earthquake. The BBC’s Turkish language service is carrying some quotes from the Hatay metropolitan municipality mayor, Lütfü Savaş, who says search and rescue operations have begun in the region after a delay. He is quoted as saying: With the support of the mayors of Ankara, Istanbul and İzmir, we can now provide food, tents and drinking water support. Most of the public buildings, our own building, the fire department, AFAD, three hospitals have been severely damaged, our losses are very high. The airport is unusable. We are focused on what we can recover quickly with construction equipment, but experienced professionals are needed. There is a serious communication problem in the city centre and in certain parts of Hatay. Savaş said there are nearly 2,000 destroyed buildings in Hatay. He was also critical of anti-earthquake precautions, saying “It is a very strong earthquake, but we could have survived it with less damage.” Turkish police on Tuesday said they had detained four people over “provocative” social media posts after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey. The four individuals were detained after officers found accounts that shared “provocative posts aiming to create fear and panic”, the police said. It added that a wider investigation into social media accounts was ongoing but offered no information on the content of the posts, Agence France-Presse reports. Turkish social media have been filled with posts by people who complain about a lack of search and rescue efforts in their area, particularly in Hatay. Turkey’s vice-president has said that the death toll in the country from the earthquake now stands at 3,419, Reuters reports. That takes the combined official death tolls from Turkey, Syria and the rebel-held areas of Syria to 5,021. Many international aid organisations have set up appeals to provide emergency assistance to Turkey and Syria after the devastating quakes yesterday which have claimed nearly 5,000 lives and levelled buildings across the region.

Reuters reports the centre said the quake was at a depth of 46 km (28.58 miles). Seismologists would expect there to be a series of aftershocks after the two major quakes yesterday. Although less powerful than the initial event, they pose a risk to rescue workers and could provoke further collapses among buildings already weakened by yesterday’s quakes. Turkey has deployed more than 24,400 search and rescue personnel to the quake area, and has confirmed that 5,775 buildings have collapsed. The number of personnel was expected to rise with the arrival of additional people, though the wintry conditions were hampering their deployment, disaster management agency official Orhan Tatar said Tuesday. Associated Press reports that Tatar said his agency had received 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, but only 5,775 of those reports have been confirmed. About 55 helicopters had conducted 154 sorties to transport emergency aid and around 85 trucks were distributing food, he said. “The adverse weather conditions continue in the region. Therefore, from time to time it may be difficult to transport these search and rescue teams to the region,” he added. Temperatures overnight in the quake-hit city of Gaziantep sank to -5C (23F). At least 812 people were killed in government-held areas in Syria following two deadly earthquakes and a series of aftershocks in neighbouring Turkey, the state news agency Sana said on Tuesday. Sana said at least 1,449 people were injured in the provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, Idlib and Tartus. Reuters also reports that the death toll given by those operating in Syria’s rebel-held areas has risen to 790, with a warning that it will “dramatically” rise. With the most recent death toll in Turkey given as 3,381, that takes the total officially confirmed dead in the three areas to 4,983. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the news wires from Turkey and Syria, illustrating the extent of the destruction caused by yesterday’s two strong quakes. Ruth Michaelson is in Turkey for the Guardian, and sends this latest dispatch: Turks increasingly vented their anger online about what they said was a negligent emergency response in the southernmost province of Hatay, with many complaining that rescue efforts had failed to reach the area. In Hatay, the quake levelled multiple government buildings including the local chapter of Turkey’s disaster relief agency, the AFAD. “I am so angry,” said analyst Gönül Tol, of the Middle East Institute in Washington. “There are no rescue teams from the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management in Hatay. People are trying to dig out loved ones trapped under rubble. It is cold, raining, no electricity. One family member is trapped under a heavy concrete slab, waiting for rescue workers for hours.” Some Turkish civilians increasingly took it on themselves to help. A 25-year-old nurse, Nihal Atasoy, spoke as she waited to board a flight to Adana, after deciding to volunteer with the rescue effort. “I used to live in Osmaniye, but when I called I couldn’t reach my friends there in the hours after the quake. When I finally got through to them they said things like ‘my house is in ruins’. So I decided to volunteer, as I normally work in intensive care,” she said. “Honestly, I don’t know what I’ll find when I get to Adana, whether I will try to save people trapped under the rubble, or work in the hospital as a nurse.” Associated Press reports that a fire at the port of İskenderun on the Mediterranean Sea continues for the second day. Television images showed thick black smoke rising from burning containers which had toppled when the quakes struck on Monday. Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency said a Turkish coast guard vessel was assisting efforts to extinguish the fire. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me via email at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Our First Edition newsletter today is on the subject of yesterday’s earthquake, and Archie Bland explains some of the science: The first earthquake took place on the East Anatolian fault – the boundary between the Anatolian plate, the African plate, and the Arabian plate in the Earth’s crust. While it has been more than a century since an earthquake caused such devastation on this fault, there have been a number of smaller quakes in the last 25 years, and the region has been considered at serious risk of something worse. There have been higher magnitude earthquakes than this one even in recent years around the world, but that is not a sufficient measure of impact on its own: crucial to the devastation here was the location of the earthquake near large population centres, and how close to the surface of the Earth it hit. A deep earthquake takes place between 300km and 700km down. This one was very shallow – about 17km below the surface – meaning that it was felt more powerfully and across a wider region above ground. That impact was magnified by a 7.5-magnitude aftershock – on a different faultline 100km away, and much larger relative to the initial quake than aftershocks typically are. Earthquake magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, meaning that this aftershock only released about a third of the energy of the first even though the figures are close – but in hitting buildings already severely damaged by the initial quake, it greatly amplified the original damage, and put many rescue workers at risk. Read more here: Why the Turkey and Syria earthquake was a catastrophe That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on this saddest of days. My colleague Martin Belam will be with you for the next few hours. It is almost 9am in Hatay, Turkey. If you’re just joining us, here is where things stand following the massive earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. International rescue missions have rushed to Turkey and Syria after one of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the region in at least a century left more than 4,800 people dead, thousands injured and an unknown number trapped in the rubble. The early-morning quake and dozens of aftershocks brought down entire apartment blocks in Turkey and heaped more destruction on Syrian communities already devastated by over a decade of war. At least 3,381 people were confirmed dead in Turkey, according to the Anadolu news organisation, which cited the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. With the death toll coming from Syria, the most recent figure for which is 1,444, that brings the total toll to 4,825. The WHO has warned the number of dead could rise to more than four times this figure, or about 20,000, in the coming days. The first quake struck as people slept and measured magnitude 7.8, making it one of the most powerful in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude and was centred 67km (42 miles) north-east of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, at a depth of 2km. More than 7,800 people have been rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkey’s disaster management authority. As of 6am, early 13,000 rescue workers, many of them volunteers, had left Istanbul to help in impacted areas, according to the news organisation Sabah, which cites the governor of Istanbul. Many are bound for Hatay, where, according to reports, there is growing anger at the lack of assistance for people trapped under the rubble. Syrian opposition said ‘hundreds of families’ are still trapped under rubble. Time is running out to save hundreds of families still trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings after this week’s devastating earthquake, the head of the Syrian opposition-run civil defence service said on Tuesday. In 1999, when a quake of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000 people. The death toll could rise to more than 20,000 people, said Catherine Smallwood, the World Health Organization’s senior emergency officer for Europe. “There’s continued potential of further collapses to happen so we do often see in the order of eightfold increases on the initial numbers,” she told AFP, speaking when the estimated toll stood at 2,600. “We always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows.” Joe Biden spoke with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Monday to offer condolences and reaffirm Washington’s readiness to assist in rescue efforts, the White House said. The US president “noted that US teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items”, said a White House statement. The death toll from Monday’s earthquakes in Turkey has risen by 460 in the last few hours from 2,921 to 3,381, according to the Anadolu news organisation, which cites the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. With the highest death toll coming from Syria, the most recent figure for which is 1,444, that brings the total toll to 4,825. The WHO has warned the number of dead could rise to more than four times this figure, or about 20,000, in the coming days. Civilians across remote towns in southern Turkey have described how relief efforts were stretched to breaking point, amid destruction stretched over a border region spanning almost 650 miles. In rebel-held northern Syria, volunteer rescue workers said they lacked some of the most basic fuel and other provisions required to pull those still trapped under the rubble of their homes. Ali Ünlü, from the remote town of Adıyaman, close to the quake epicentre in Kahramanmaraş, said that he had been working to free his elderly mother who was trapped under the rubble of her home since the earthquake levelled buildings in the town early on Monday morning. “After the earthquake I ran to my mother’s house, and saw the building had collapsed. I was devastated. I started waiting for rescue teams, but they didn’t show up. I started calling officials, all the lines cut out. I gave my name and a record of the incident, but the officials said everyone is waiting. Since I called thens, no one has showed up,” he said. “The weather is extremely cold, and we have no food. At first, one of my relatives texted that he is under the rubble and we could hear his voice under the debris. He was very close, I could hear him. He was trapped there for four hours, and eventually we dug him out. We also saved two or three others, but these are the ones that were living on higher floors. My mother, however, lived on the first floor. Eventually we had to stop as it was raining and there is a danger of the buildings collapsing further. We’ve waited until the morning, but there is no one. They said they’d come but that the roads were damaged, hospitals too. These resources are stretched so thin, but I feel there’s a lack of organisation.” He added: “It’s been over 24 hours and my mother is still trapped under the rubble. I don’t know if she’s still alive or not.” Associated Press journalist Sarah El Deeb reports that 244 buildings have been destroyed in Syria, and a further 325 damaged: Here are some of the most striking photographs from the last 24 hours: More than 7,800 people have been rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkey’s disaster management authority. Time is running out to save hundreds of families still trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings after this week’s devastating earthquake, the head of the Syrian opposition-run civil defence service said on Tuesday. Raed al-Saleh told Reuters that urgent help was needed from international groups for the rescue effort by the organisation known as the White Helmets in rebel-held northwest Syria, where hundreds were killed and injured. “Every second means saving lives and we call on all humanitarian organisations to give material aid and respond to this catastrophe urgently,” he said. It is nearing 9am in Turkey, and we are seeing more photos of rescue efforts. 24-year-old Rumeysa Yalcinkaya was rescued this morning after 27 hours trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building in Kahramanmaraş. Here is what international front pages look like a day after the disaster: Here are some of the international rescue teams making their way to Turkey from Germany, the US and Pakistan: Difficult conditions and freezing temperatures hampered rescue efforts overnight in Turkey and Syria, one day after a powerful earthquake struck the region, killing at least 4,300 people. As the scale of the devastation from the 7.8 magnitude tremor continued to unfold, the World Health Organization warned the number of casualties could exceed 20,000. International rescue missions rushed to both countries and worked through the night to find survivors on Tuesday. The early-morning quake and aftershocks, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor, wiped out entire apartment blocks in Turkey and heaped more destruction on Syrian communities already devastated by over a decade of war: As of 6 am, early 13,000 rescue workers, many of them volunteers, had left Istanbul in the last 12 hours, according to the news organisation Sabah, which cites the governor of Istanbul. Many are bound for Hatay, where, according to reports, there is growing anger at the lack of assistance for people trapped under the rubble. US-Turkey thinktank The SETA Foundation at Washington DC, posted this video of the large numbers of volunteers arriving at Istanbul airport overnight: Soylu has also posted this startling video of what the earthquake has done to a road: In Hatay, there is “huge anger” over the lack of emergency response personnel, Ragıp Soylu, the Turkey bureau chief for Middle East Eye, reports: Mexico is sending rescue dogs with search and rescue teams to help in the aftermath of an earthquakes. Here are some more videos from overnight of people waiting near their loved ones and calling for help from rescue workers, via Bermet Talant, a journalist and former Guardian Australia contributor: New Zealand’s government will provide NZ$1.5m (US$950,000) to the relief efforts in Turkey and Syria, foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta said. The contribution via the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies will include $1m for Turkey and $500,000 for Syria, and will be used for “essential relief items” such as food, tents, blankets, and medical support, Mahuta said in a statement. She added: “Officials will continue to monitor the humanitarian needs and assess options for further support.” Another earthquake has hit central Turkey, Reuters reports, citing the Euro-Mediterranean Seismic Centre, which says that the quake measured 5.6. A series of aftershocks are expected to follow the first earthquake. According to the earthquake magnitude scale used by Michigan Technological University, 5.6 is likely to cause “slight damage to buildings and other structures”. We’ll have more on this shortly. The population of the ten provinces in southern Turkey affected by the earthquakes are home to 13.5 million people. So far, according to the Anadolu agency, more than 5,600 buildings have collapsed. It is just after 6am in Turkey, and we’re seeing stories of people rescued after a very long day and night, which means they survived not only the rubble’s collapse but the cold. There are many, many more who have not yet been found, with the WHO predicting the death toll could reach 20,000 in the coming days. For now, here are videos of a three-year-old toddler and a woman who were freed from collapsed buildings by rescuers: Survivors are being evacuated by military plane to areas where hospitals have greater capacity. In this video from the Anadolu agency, a military plane carrying injured survivors arrives in Istanbul: My colleagues Ben Doherty and Mostafa Rachwani have this report on the earthquake survivors joining the search for the missing: “There is a family I know under the rubble,” Omer El Cuneyd said, standing amid the chaos of the shattered city of Şanlıurfa. “Until 11am or noon, my friend was still answering the phone. But she no longer answers. She is down there. I think her battery ran out,” he said, hoping against hope, for a miracle. On the road, a stream of cars crawled north out of the city, taking traumatised residents away from the scene of Turkey’s most powerful earthquake in decades. Nearby, a distraught family walked in the freezing rain, their belongings piled into a pram, look for a shelter to spend the night in. Şanlıurfa, an historic, once-bustling city in southeastern Turkey, was devastated by the series of massive earthquakes that struck southern Turkey early on Monday morning, claiming more than 4,300 lives across the mostly Kurdish regions of the country and in neighbouring Syria. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest from the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. You can get in touch with me directly on Twitter here if you see news you think we may have missed. The death toll from the two quakes has risen to more than 4,300 according to government figures. At least 2,921 have been confirmed dead in Turkey, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said, and 1,444 in Syria, according to figures from the Damascus Government and rescue workers. Thousands more are injured, and the death toll is expected to rise. In 1999, when a tremor of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000. The WHO warned that the toll from Monday’s earthquakes could pass 20,000. Here is what we know so far: The first quake struck as people slept, and measured magnitude 7.8, one of the most powerful quakes in the region in at least a century. It was felt as far away as Cyprus and Cairo. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude, and was 67km (42 miles) north-east of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, at a depth of 2km. In 1999, when a tremor of similar magnitude hit the heavily populated eastern Marmara Sea region near Istanbul, it killed more than 17,000. The death toll could rise to over 20,000, the World Health Organization’s senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said. “There’s continued potential of further collapses to happen so we do often see in the order of eight fold increases on the initial numbers,” she told AFP, speaking when the estimated toll stood at 2,600. “We always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows,” Smallwood added. US President Joe Biden spoke with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday to offer condolences and reaffirm Washington’s readiness to assist in rescue efforts, the White House said. Biden “noted that US teams are deploying quickly to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and coordinate other assistance that may be required by people affected by the earthquakes, including health services or basic relief items,” the White House said in a statement. Syria’s envoy to the UN said Monday that aid sent after the earthquake will reach all its population, even though Damascus does not control all of its territory. Asked if aid donated to Syria – some areas are held by rebels – would reach all of the population, Syria’s UN envoy Bassam Sabbagh said it would. “We assure the UN that we are ready to help and to coordinate to provide assistance to all Syrians in all territory of Syria,” Sabbagh said after meeting with UN secretary general António Guterres to convey a Syrian government request for aid. “We are ready to help also those who wanted to provide the help in all Syria,” he stressed. More than 10 search and rescue teams from the European Union have been mobilised to help with the recovery, a spokesperson for the European Commission said. The US, UK, Canada, Israel, Russia and China are among other nations to have offered assistance and calls have emerged for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country’s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake. Prisoners mutinied in a northwestern Syria prison Monday after the earthquake, with at least 20 escaping the jail holding mostly Islamic State group members, a source at the facility told AFP. There have been more than a 100 smaller aftershocks registered by seismologists. Turkey’s armed forces have set up an air corridor to enable search and rescue teams to reach the zone affected. Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is under construction, was not damaged by the earthquake, an official from the Russian company building the plant said. The Swedish presidency of the European Union has activated the integrated political crisis response (IPCR) to coordinate EU support measures in response to the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the EU Council said in a statement. The IPCR arrangements strengthen the EU’s ability to take rapid decisions when facing major cross-sectoral crises requiring a response at the EU level. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has called for increased funding for humanitarian aid in Syria, saying that many people in the north-west of the country have already been displaced up to 20 times, and that medical care in the region was “strained beyond capacity, even before this tragedy”. The partial destruction of a Roman-era castle in the Turkish city of Gaziantep has led to fears that two earthquakes that struck on Monday may have damaged other priceless monuments in Turkey and Syria, areas rich in cultural heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power plants may not keep Britain's lights on, say Lib Dems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power plants may not keep Britain's lights on, say Lib Dems","bodyText":"New nuclear power stations may not be the best option for keeping Britain’s lights on and meeting the country’s carbon targets, the Liberal Democrats have said. The party said there were legitimate concerns over nuclear’s cost and the risks it would not be delivered on time, just days after windfarms secured state support far more cheaply than the Hinkley Point C atomic power station. However, the party, which voted in support of nuclear four years ago after decades of opposition, said the technology should still be considered an option in the UK’s future energy mix. “Nuclear power should be kept open as an option – but there is a risk that it may not be able to keep the lights on and that it may not be the lowest-cost option,” said the Lib Dems in a new report, authored by the former coalition minister Lynne Featherstone. Vince Cable, the party’s leader, said this week that the breakthrough low subsidy prices for offshore windfarms should prompt a “radical reappraisal” of how Britain is powered. If the Lib Dems were to go so far as opposing atomic power again, it would mark a break in the pro-nuclear cross-party consensus of the three main parties. Senior Lib Dems believe the party has an opportunity to seize the momentum on environmental issues, with Labour constrained on issues such as nuclear power because of its close association with trade unions. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP and former energy minister who was pivotal in the party’s support for nuclear, said of the report: “It’s not about taking nuclear off the table. It’s responding to the evidence of the last two years. “It’s a recalibration off the back of the fact nuclear is not proving to be a practical, affordable technology. It’s not saying never [to nuclear], but the costs are coming down fast with renewables.” The report also backed an acceleration of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater flexibility of the energy system through storage and interconnectors with other countries. The party accused the Conservatives of “unravelling” progress on climate change made by the Lib Dems during the coalition government years. “What worries me about the Tories is they have taken CCS off table, they’re not pushing forward with renewables,” said Davey. The report concludes that the UK is on course to miss its contribution towards the Paris climate agreement aspirational target of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C. To get back on track, the Lib Dems are calling for the Climate Change Act’s target of an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 to be brought forward by five to 10 years. Last year the government’s climate advisers warned that the UK lacked policies to meet half of the carbon reductions required by 2030. Ministers have produced a blueprint on how to close the gap, the Clean Growth Plan, which could be published as soon as next week. Before the party’s annual conference in Bournemouth this weekend, Cable said the world would “soon reach a tipping point beyond which catastrophic global warming will become irreversible” and Britain had a responsibility to set an example. “Instead, these past two years the Conservatives have done their best to trash our green industries and undo the progress made during the coalition years,” he said. “This report shows that becoming carbon-free by 2050 will be crucial if we are to meet the Paris agreement’s ambitious target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Furthermore, it sets out how this ambition can be delivered.” The party will also hope to burnish its environmental credentials in the coming months with the debate over Heathrow expansion, which it opposes. The majority of Labour MPs are in favour of expansion, as is the Unite trade union, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are against further expansion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2020/jan/30/mike-pompeo-restates-us-opposition-to-huawei-access","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-30T18:32:28Z","webTitle":"Mike Pompeo restates US opposition to Huawei access","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/30/mike-pompeo-restates-us-opposition-to-huawei-access","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2020/jan/30/mike-pompeo-restates-us-opposition-to-huawei-access","fields":{"headline":"Mike Pompeo restates US opposition to Huawei access","bodyText":"The depth of American opposition to the UK granting the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei access to its 5G network has been underlined as the US secretary of state said the Chinese Communist party represented the central threat of our times, and had front-door access to Huawei systems. He said the US would try to work through its differences with the UK decision announced this week but stressed the US would never permit its national security information to go across networks in which it did not have confidence. Mike Pompeo, who is on a visit to London to meet Boris Johnson on the eve of the UK departure from the EU, was speaking alongside the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. Asked if the US would reduce intelligence sharing with the UK due to the Huawei access to the UK network, Pompeo said: “We will never permit American international security information to go across a network that we don’t have trust and confidence in. “That’s the standard, whether it is a Microsoft system, it is the same whether it is a Ericsson, a Nokia system, that’s the standard if it is a Chinese system. “We will work with our UK counterparts, and I know the Australians, the New Zealanders, all others in the ‘five eyes’, will work together to ensure the systems are sufficiently secure and they are going to deliver the outcomes we need them to deliver, and that we have only a level of risk in the system that we find tolerable. “I’m sure that we will protect American information to that standard.” The tone of his remarks suggest the US regards the UK decision as an open negotiating point with room to still change. The US believes that with the decision also unpopular on the Conservative backbenches, in the months ahead it may in effect be nullified. But Pompeo warned that the Chinese Communist party did not have “a technical back door to Huawei. They have the front door.” He said the US had been making the case that having Huawei technology within the network was “very difficult to mitigate” and so was “not worth the candle”. “When you allow the information of your citizens or the national security information of your citizens to transit a network that the Chinese Communist party has a legal mandate to obtain it creates risk.” But Pompeo set the Huawei decision in the starkest context by saying the US now regards the Chinese Communist party as antithetical to US values and a bigger threat than terrorism. Speaking later on LBC, Pompeo said: “We view the intrusion of the Chinese Communist party into information technology systems as a very great risk, a national security risk as well as a core privacy risk. If your health records are on a system that belongs and is controlled by the Chinese Communist party that is probably not something you would probably choose in the first instance.” At the earlier event with Raab, he wished “Godspeed” to the UK’s departure from the EU, he underlined the tensions ahead by saying it was fantastic that the UK in future would be able to disalign from EU regulations, so making business with the US easier. His remarks underline the extent to which the UK will come under US pressure in trade negotiations to maximise its distance from the EU, even though this may mean a more limited UK-EU trade deal. Pompeo said: “The previous administration took the view that if the United Kingdom made this decision it would be at the back of the line. We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line.” Both Raab and Pompeo held back from predicting that a deal could be agreed before the US presidential elections this November. Pressed to explain why the US had refused the UK government request to extradite Anne Sacoolas over the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn last year, Pompeo simply said the case was an enormous tragedy and he was terribly sorry for the loss of a British citizen’s life. He said “the US would do everything possible to make that right in a way that protects the important relationship between the two countries”. He said he was still working on a good resolution to the disagreement, but did not go into any specifics. Nothing he said suggested he was going to comply with the UK extradition request. Raab rejected any suggestion that there could be a link between the Sacoolas extradition and the US requests for Prince Andrew to cooperate with the inquiry into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Raab said one of the points of the discussions with the US was to ensure that such an episode did not reoccur, including a review of the extradition system. Pompeo claimed the US policy of maximum economic sanctions on Iran was working, saying “the fewer dollars in the hands of the Ayatollah was a good thing”, describing Iran as the central threat to stability in the Middle East. Although Raab agreed there had been wholesale non-compliance of the nuclear deal by Iran, he said the UK still favoured staying inside the nuclear deal since it “wanted to leverage Iran back into some kind of diplomacy negotiation to get compliance”. He added: “If the JCPOA (the technical term for the nuclear deal) can be used to do that, that would be valuable.” The US left the deal in 2018, prompting Tehran to take a succession of steps away from it in an attempt to leverage European nations to do more to boost trade with Iran. Tehran now states it is free to take whatever steps it wishes to develop a civil nuclear power programme, but continues to allow the UN atomic inspectors to monitor and report on the Iranian programme. Throughout the one-hour joint conversation at the Policy Exchange thinktank Raab referred to the creases in the US-UK special relationship, but focused on the shared objectives and values that bind the special relationship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-07T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world’s first cryptocurrency cruise ship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading","fields":{"headline":"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world’s first cryptocurrency cruise ship","bodyText":"On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean. Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared. The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”. Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.” In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters. Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’” * * * As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.) After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute. So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme. After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box. The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype. Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap. Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&amp;O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B. The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax. * * * “Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”. Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”) Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise. But as the Reddit Q&amp;A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.” Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm. On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero. The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.) One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.” A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran. On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.” * * * Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&amp;O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools). For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.” On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.” As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.” To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&amp;O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates. The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&amp;O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.” * * * As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters. Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans. After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.” To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.” Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’” Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling. “It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.” * * * The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment. On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded. The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship. Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted. * * * Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled. All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal. The client was Ambassador Cruise Line, the first British cruise company to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months. On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill. The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention. Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk. At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.” When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a five-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency. The water slides will be removed. • This article was amended on 8 September 2021 to include the full name of Ambassador Cruise Line, and to clarify that the Ambience’s dinners will have five courses, not three. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/jul/28/uk-politics-live-conservative-tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-debate-hustings-labour-keir-starmer-sam-tarry","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T21:18:54Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss facing Tory members in Leeds for first official leadership hustings – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jul/28/uk-politics-live-conservative-tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-debate-hustings-labour-keir-starmer-sam-tarry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/jul/28/uk-politics-live-conservative-tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-debate-hustings-labour-keir-starmer-sam-tarry","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss facing Tory members in Leeds for first official leadership hustings – as it happened","bodyText":"We are closing this blog now. Thanks for following along with us. You can read all our politics here . As you all catch your breath from that on the edge of your seat viewing, some reaction from the commentariat. Liz Truss did seem more human and compared to previous hustings, where she was criticised for being robotic. She seemed to go down better in the room, from what could be gathered from watching online, but it is backed up by people in Leeds tonight. Sunak still has a long way to go. The next hustings is in the cathedral city of Exeter next week. Truss says that shortages of labour are the same across the world, in the US and Canada and not down to Brexit. “In Europe they are also struggling to get workers on their farms as well. We have the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. I talked about my passion for British food, and I think it’s right we open up for these workers.” Then a question about child benefits, and the threshold being £50k where if one of the parents get that income, they no longer qualify. Truss repeats that she wants to reform the tax system. “We need to make sure it works with things like child benefit, but we need to simplify the system.” She is then asked if Jeremy Hunt would get a job in her cabinet, she declines to answer but says jobs will be given out on the basis of whether they can do the job. Final question, after the two hour marathon is about the difference between pensioners who have the triple lock on their pensions and younger people who are harder hit by the cost of living crisis. Truss says she wants to get more people working part time, including retired people. “There are lots of roles that people can take up, and make a huge contribution to our society. People are living longer and one of the best things that David Cameron did was remove the compulsory retirement age.” The foreign secretary then finishes up by reiterating her reforms to the planning system and housebuilding. And that’s it. After a question about local authorities, Truss is challenged over her negative comments about the school she attended, which others have called inaccurate. “You make it sound like it’s some bog-standard comprehensive, it’s nothing like it,” the questioner says. “I’m not claiming it was a sink school, it was an average comprehensive at the time. And at that average comprehensive under the auspices of Leeds city council there were too many kids able to leave school without the education they need, the teaching was patchy, we didn’t have league tables at the time, or a national curriculum, there were kids who fell through the cracks. “There were low expectations of some of the pupils at the school, and sometimes those low expectations were about where those kids had come from in Leeds. There were different expectations from the kids from the middle class areas, than who had come from the council estate. I thought that was wrong.” A question about mixed-sex toilets in schools, with an audience member saying that a lot of changes were made in schools during Covid closures, and that girls’ toilets were removed. Truss replies: “I agree with you, I have sought to clarify that as women’s minister. I have been very clear that single sex spaces should be protected, particularly for young people, as well as vulnerable people, vulnerable women in domestic violence shelters, and I can assure you as prime minister, I would direct that to happen. “Our girls, it’s a difficult time being a teenager, being a young girl and you should be able to have the privacy you need in your own loo.” Truss says that she doesn’t believe teenagers should be able to make “irreversible decisions to do with their own bodies that they might later regret”. She adds that schools can provide additional facilities, but not by taking away single-sex toilets. Truss backs more investment and transport links in the north. In response to a following question, she says that she was sceptical about HS2, but now it is going ahead there needs to be a focus on value for money. She adds that it needs to be done quicker, now we are out of the EU, and that different procurement rules have slowed us down. Then a question about energy supply, and fracking. Truss says she supports it in areas where people want it to happen, and it can be part of the future for energy in the UK, in conjunction with nuclear power. In response to an opening question about how to support children who suffered through the pandemic, Truss says that support wil be given to early years. “We need kids who get to school to be able to count, to be able to read, to be able to do all those basic things to be able to benefit from a primary education.” She adds she will push for education standards over English and maths to be improved. Truss goes on to say that there should be more mental health support available in schools for children. She says that she would not have closed schools during Covid. “There was a time where we kept pubs open but closed schools.” Truss says the attempt to rewrite parliamentary rules to try and support Owen Paterson was a mistake and she wouldn’t do it again, if similar circumstances repeated themelves. She adds that there needs to be more support for MPs. After questions about Johnson’s support for Ukraine, and a prediction for the women’s Euros final on Sunday that’s it for Ferrari’s questions. On to the audience now. Truss is asked about company profits, and is asked about windfall taxes. She says she doesn’t support another one as it puts off investment. She said she would be encouraging Shell and other companies to invest in the UK to improve productivity. She would create low-tax investment zones to encourage more investment. Truss seems to be addressing the audience as well as Ferrari, more than Sunak was doing earlier. Ferrari brings up her previous republicanism and asks what happens if the Queen asks about it during their first audience. “Almost as soon as I made the speech I regretted it. I was a bit of a teenage controversialist. “Within these four walls, I was briefly a member of the Liberal Democrats, I did leave it when I was 21 when I came of age and realised the error of my ways.” Truss said that Margaret Thatcher was the best Conservative PM, after “turning around the country ... as the sick man of Europe”. “What I sensed in the 1980s was a growing sense of pride in our country and a growing sense of optimism in our future. I think the pinnacle was when we saw the Berlin Wall fall. When we saw the freedom and democracy and pride in our values influencing the rest of the world.” On to the yes or no questions. Is Love Island misogynistic, Ferrari asks. Truss says she watched it recently with her daughter and was horrified but does not answer the question directly. Then Ferrari asks if England and Wales should boycott the World Cup in Qatar, after previously backing a boycott of the Champions League final in Moscow. She says not. “If we insisted that every contry we traded with, or did business with, or attended a football match in, had the same standards as the United Kingdom, we wouldn’t be doing business with many countries. We need to be pragmatic. What Russia did to Ukraine was beyond the pail.” Truss then says she has never used illegal drugs. Ferrari asks Truss if her plans really add up. She says all of her tax reductions are costed. “There is £30bn in the budget, and we will be able to start paying down debt in three years. It’s a false economy to raise taxes when it can cut off growth, we know that, we know what Britain was like in the 1970s with high taxes and militant trade unions. I didn’t agree with those people who say you can keep raising tax and the money will keep rolling in.” She says people won’t want to work and won’t invest if taxes stay high. Truss says that the tax system in the UK is too complicated, in response to a question about inheritance tax. It needs to be fairer, she says, and would look at inheritance tax. “I’d look at the overall tax system in the round and make sure it’s fair. We need to reward people who do the right thing, who set up businesses, who earn money and want to pass it on to their children.” Ferrari asks who was better, Theresa May or Boris Johnson after Truss served both of them. “Put it this way, in the 2016 leadership election after the referendum I backed Boris first, then I backed Theresa May once Boris had left the race. I’ve always been a fan of Boris Johnson, I think he did a fantastic job as prime minister, he delivered Brexit, he delivered on the vaccine and I was proud to serve as a loyal member of his cabinet.” Liz Truss now in the hot seat, with Nick Ferrari kicking things off by asking if there is a risk of Truss accidentally walking the UK into a nuclear war, after Vladimir Putin put his forces on high alert after her comments earlier this year. She says: “The fact that Russia have spread propaganda about me, is I think a sign that the strength the United Kingdom has shown in leading the free world in the fight against Russia and supporting Ukraine has had a real impact. “I take it as a badge of honour that I have been sanctioned by the Russian regime. We have stood up to Russia, we have encouraged our allies in the free world to stand up to this appalling regime. It’s completely wrong to listen to any of the sabre-rattling or propaganda. The reason they are doing this is that Putin’s evil plans to take Kyiv in a few days didn’t work.” Sunak finishes up after questions about the benefits system, which he says he would tighten up, and about appointing William Hague, his predecessor in Richmond, as Conservative party chair. Sunak says he doesn’t think the former Tory leader would be interested. Another audience member accuses Sunak of “stabbing Johnson in the back” over his resignation. He asks how will take the party through the next general election. Sunak says he didn’t stab Johnson in the back. “There was a speech that was due to be given and it was clear we had very different points of view.” He adds: “It was a very difficult decision - it wasn’t one I took lightly. I am very grateful to the PM for making me chancellor. I gave everything for that job and delivering for you and getting through coronavirus and I do think he was the only person who could have broken the Brexit gridlock. “It got for me personally to a position where I couldn’t stay. I had a significant difference of opinion in the challenges ahead of us, and there was no way I could stay. There is no way a chancellor and a PM cannot be joined at the hip. I had no choice but to resign and that was the right thing to do.” Sunak says he would be firm with Nicola Sturgeon about another referendum. He says that the government should not just “devolve and forget” with ministers needing to be “more active” in Scotland. “We can’t just talk in arguments to do with our head. Nationalism is a seductive and romantic idea. We have got to make arguments about the union that speaks to people’s hearts and their emotions. If we focus on the practicalities we will not be successful.” A councillor in Selby asks about keeping small business relief to help support shops. Sunak says he will. He refers to his “help to grow” programme among other initiatives he introduced as chancellor. Theresa then asks about controlling illegal immigration with small boats arriving from France. “That’s one of the things I want to grip as quickly as possible as PM. Some of the things we need to do quickly; we need to change the definition from what counts as asylum and move away from the very expansive ECHR definition where people can claim all sorts of reasons for being here, and move towards the refugee convention definition which is tighter. “We should make our foreign policy more linked to taking back failed asylum seekers. If we are going to provide aid to countries, we should be linking it to taking back asylum seekers we want to make sure aren’t here any more. We need to improve the current system to get through it. We need to look at our rates of objection and acceptance. For some reason we reject far fewer asylum seekers than other countries.” Sunak says he will make the Rwanda policy work, and believes it is workable in the long term. Sunak is now taking questions from the audience. Laura up first. She asks a left-field one to get the ball rolling: if greyhound racing will be banned on animal rights grounds. He says he hasn’t ever looked at it in great detail. Sunak says that ‘Eat out to help out wasn’t a mistake despite a rise in coronavirus infections. “Every country in Europe ended up having the same spike thereafter, every single one, and they ended up putting more restrictions in place afterwards. It’s hard to say that’s the difference.” He says it helped protect jobs in hospitality, who are younger and on lower incomes. More applause. Sunak is asked what he would say to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, to try and attract his support. He won’t give a figure on increases to defence spending, saying he doesn’t believe in “arbitary targets”. He says: “I was a chancellor who supported Ben in the largest uplift in [defence] spending since the cold war, and we did that before we settled any other department in the middle of Covid, I was also the chancellor who ensured we supported Ben to get £2bn of aid to Ukraine to stand up to Russian aggression.” A question from Ferrari on image: Sunak is told he has Prada shoes, a photo opportunity with a car he doesn’t own, he pours pints for cameras despite being teetotal, and has a green card despite living in Downing Street. Ferrari asks what people should make of this. “This is not about what shoes I wear, it’s about what I want to do in Downing Street,” he says. This gets the most applause he’s had this evening. Ferrari says that about 14,000 members of the Conservative party want Johnson back on the ballot. This gets support and applause from the audience. He asks what Sunak thinks of this. “Close to 60 people resigned in parliament, it’s incumbent on the prime minister to have the confidence of the parliamentary party,” Sunak says. “That wasn’t there at the end. Whether he’s on the ballot or not, you have to command the confidence of your MPs, and we got to a position where 60 of them resigned from government.” Ferrari asks about using Boris Johnson as an envoy to Ukraine, after Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s praise for him. He asks whether the former chancellor would give him a role in his government. Sunak says he wouldn’t offer him a job in the cabinet. “I don’t know if he would want to do it ... I’m not going to sit here and allocate jobs to people, but I do think we need to move forward, I don’t see that being a role in the cabinet for Boris, but I do think he’ll have a role in public life. He’s an extraordinary figure and I’m sure he has a lot more to give.” Ferrari asks how striking workers would be tackled. Sunak says there should be a legal minimum level of service for critical industries including rail. Some quick-fire questions from Ferrari: firstly Sunak says he would support the return of grammar schools, adding it’s in line with his prioritisation of education that he mentioned in his stump speech. When Ferrari talks about water company directors going to jail in response to pollution, Sunak demures and says they should be “held to a high standard”, but doesn’t say they should go to prison. Sunak then says he has never used illegal drugs, in response to a final question. Ferrari asks that with the economic sitaution so dire, why should people trust Sunak. Sunak says that the UK had a faster recovery than other countries from Covid. “If you look at it over the period, we are actually very much in line or to the top end of the G7. Of course I want to see growth. We have to look at how we do that. We’ve had a very narrow conversation about tax, and in a 21st-century economy there is many more things we have to get right.” Sunak talks about financial markets reform, about a visa regime for migrant workers, and reviewing regulation to support entrepreneurs. The former chancellor says he wants to get more investment in the economy. In response to another question he says that Margaret Thatcher was the best Conservative prime minister. Ferrari asks what her reaction would have been to Sunak raising corporation tax. “If you look at her early budgets and what we had to do as a country, she understood that you had to get a grip of inflation first, and public spending and borrowing. Her mantra was to do that first, because if inflation had run out of control, it would have been far worse for the economy. It was only after that was under control that she embarked on a plan of supply-side reform,” he says. He adds that he would cut tax on business investment, which gets applause. LBC’s Nick Ferrari takes the stage now, ready to ask questions of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Ferrari speaks to Sunak first. he asks if he has done a U-turn over VAT on energy bills after saying it was “unconservative”. “No, definitely not. There’s two very different things here. We have a short term problem with energy bills. We need to make sure that the support with energy bills is appropriate fo rthe scale for the challenge millions of households are facing. “We announced support earlier this year for people after it was announced that energy bills will get to £2,800. For the most vulnerable families, that gets to about £1,200 of help. Now, people’s expectations of what will happen to energy bills has gone up. It is reasonable that there is more we can do. “That’s a temporary and time limited support to help people.” Another Yorkshire line from Liz Truss, who says that the Conservatives need to summon the spirit of former Leeds United manager Don Revie, who went on to have a chequered spell as England manager after leaving Elland Road. “We need to win. My friends, we can win against Keir Starmer, who is a patronising, plastic patriot. He is beatable, but he is only beatable if we deliver. I can assure you, if you select me, if you elect me, I will work my socks off in No 10 to deliver all of the promises we made in 2019 and to deliver a victory for the Conservatives in 2024.” That’s it for Truss’s speech, there’s a break now for a few minutes before it resumes with a question and answer session. Truss said that people should be encouraged to “love their country”, after more references to straight-talking people in Yorkshire, free-speech and people knowing “a woman is a woman”. She adds that people need to be proud to be Conservative. “The people who voted for us in 2019 in seats like Keighley or Dewsbury, they didn’t vote for us because they wanted Labour policies. They were fed up of Labour and Labour councils. They voted for us because they wanted opportunity and aspired to better things and aspired for better things in their area.” Truss then turns to say that the UK needs to continue to stand up to Vladimir Putin, talking about the action that has been taken so far. “I will not let up until Ukraine prevails and Putin fails. “We have to recognise that we need to spend more on defence. After the cold war we let our guard slip and alowed the aggressors to expand. That is why I would put defence spending up to 3% of GDP by the end of the decade. There is nothing more important than freedom and democracy.” After being introduced by James Cleverly, and a promotional video being played, Liz Truss walks on to the stage, which is round with chairs surrounding it. Truss talks up her Leeds connections, among other things jokingly apologising to any former teachers of hers in the audience, saying she got “grit, determination and straight-talking” from Yorkshire. “The fact is, we face a huge global economic crisis. We have the worst war that has taken place on European shores happening in Ukraine. Now is not the time for business as usual. Now is not the time for the status quo, we need to be bold and do things differently.” She said she would reverse the increases in national insurance, stop the green levy on fuel bills, and not increase corporation tax in an attempt to encourage investment. Truss said she would abolish “Soviet-style” housing targets. “I believe that we need to be on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing. People who save their money, people who start their own businesses, the self-employed, people who go into work every day. That’s whose side I’m on,” she said. Truss says she will give power back to local people over planning, saying rules should not be the same in London as Yorkshire or Cornwall. She goes on to refer to the transport system in Leeds, saying it is the same as it was when she was a teenager. The foreign secretary repeats her pledge to go ahead with Northern Powerhouse Rail. Sunak, speaking without notes, says borrowing is “not Conservative”, referring to Liz Truss’ plans, and adds that he will cut taxes for both people and business. He says that he will take advantage of the benefits of Brexit, including reforming regulation in financial services, data and life sciences. The former chancellor says that the Conservatives need to win a fifth election term. “It’s a challenge but I know we can do it together. But in order to do it, we will have to appeal to swing voters in every part of our country, north and south, remain and leave, urban and rural, Scotland and Wales, and I believe with all my heart, I am the person, I am the candidate, that gives our party the best opportunity to secure that victory and ensure that the Labour party and Keir Starmer never walk through the doors of No 10 Downing Street.” Sunak admits he is the underdog, but compares his leadership candidacy to his attempt to become the candidate for Richmond seven years ago, when he became an MP. “I promise you I am going to fight for every single vote. I am going to fight for the Conservative values that are core to who I am and what I stand for, and I am going to fight hard for the argument that we should not mortgage our children and grandchildren’s future to make our lives easier for today.” Sunak continues: “I want a Britain where the birthright of every child is a world-class education. A Britain which is built on hard work, aspiration and hope. A Britain where we lead the world in setting the standard for integrity, decency and leadership, and a Britain where we have enormous pride in our history and enormous confidence in our future.” Sunak adds that trust needs to be restored, saying he has not taken an easy road and has wanted to be honest about the challenges that Britain faces. “That’s what leadership is about,” he says. He talks about his plans to tackle the NHS backlog, illegal immigration and address the cost-of-living crisis and soaring inflation. “Yes, this is a compassionate and welcoming country but we must also have control of our borders and as prime minister I will grip that problem and solve it and restore trust back in the system. “We need to grip inflation because it’s the enemy that makes everyone poorer. It reduces their living standards and erodes their hard-earned savings. It pushes up mortgage rates, and I will grip inflation and get it back down.” David Davis is addressing the members in Leeds, as the event is now running behind schedule. The former leadership candidate – he came second in 2005 – calls Rishi Sunak a “man of great honesty and great integrity”. Sunak’s first up. He says he’s had the “time of his life” in the last week as he’s been travelling across the country talking to members. He then launches into his stump speech about his family background. “I’m standing before you all for one simple reason, that’s because this country did something absolutely incredible for my family. It welcomed them here as immigrants 60 years ago, and allowed them to build a better life. My Dad was an NHS GP. My Mum ran the local chemist in Southampton where I grew up. They brought me up with a set of values that are absolutely core to who I am today. “The first of those values is that family means everything to me. The bonds of love, sacrifice, commitment that family brings are far greater than anything that any government could ever replicate, and nobody should ever forget that.” He says his values are patriotism, aspiration, hard work, education, family and service. Sunak says they are Conservative values. “I want to put those Conservative values into action for this country,” he says. A reminder of the format for tonight’s hustings: each candidate will give a 10-minute speech to start, which will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. We’re just waiting for it to get under way. Iain Dale is currently talking about hosting the last hustings in 2019 on LBC, with his colleague Nick Ferrari in the chair tonight. Rishi Sunak has accepted another interview offer from a broadcaster, which Liz Truss is yet to agree to. Sunak will speak to Nick Robinson in a one-on-one interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme in August. Although the broadcaster said it hopes Truss will also take part in an interview with Robinson in August, the foreign secretary’s campaign team has not yet confirmed if she will agree, PA Media reports. Truss has so far declined to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on Channel 4, while Sunak has agreed. The BBC News press team said on Twitter: “We can confirm Rishi Sunak will take part in a one-to-one interview with Nick Robinson on Wednesday August 10. “As we announced last week, we’ve invited both candidates to be interviewed and we hope Liz Truss will join us later in August.” A Conservative party councillor who was at the same school as Liz Truss at the same time as her, is the latest to challenge her claim it “let down” children in Roundhay, a suburb in the north of the city. Truss went to Roundhay school, which is rated “outstanding” by Ofsted. She caused unhappiness with her recent assertion that it “let down” children and drove her to become a Conservative. Voters in Leeds told the Guardian this week that Truss was “delusional” and that her claims were misleading. Another former pupil at the school at about the same time as Truss, the Guardian US’s Martin Pengelly said she was misrepresenting her education. ITV’s Robert Peston spoke to Nathan Hull, a Tory councillor who went to Roundhay, outside the hustings in Leeds. He is supporting Rishi Sunak for the party’s leadership. He said: “I was in the year below Liz, and it was a fantastic school. My parents sent seven children there, every single child came out with a degree. “I have a different recollection to the school she describes. It was a friendly place, first class education, brilliant teachers, the facilities were fantastic and everyone there was pretty pleased with the education they got. “I disagreed with the whole sentiment of what she was saying. I don’t feel the children were let down by the school.” Former cabinet minister David Gauke, has written a piece for the New Statesman (paywall) saying he can understand why Conservative party members like Liz Truss, but that electing her leader would be a gamble. Gauke, who voted to remain in the EU and was kicked out of the Conservative party in 2019, losing as an independent in the general election later that year, said Truss is likeable and “engaging”. He adds: Her political skills can be underrated. She can be perceptive – I recall her telling me about the UK’s political realignment long before the idea became commonplace. In contrast to the current prime minister, she is not motivated by the desire to hold office for the sake of it but wishes to gain power because she wants to do things. However Gauke said he fears that her convictions and values might come unstuck in the current economic and political climate, and that her stubbornness might end up being fatal. The biggest risk of a prime minister Truss – and I think it is a very real and substantial risk – is that her determination is not tempered by realism and a willingness to listen to expert opinion. Conservative party members admire her ideological clarity, but they are taking the most enormous gamble on her judgement. Candidates have started arriving at the Centenary Pavilion, in Elland Road, for tonight’s hustings. The venue is opposite Leeds United’s historic football stadium. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak will face questions from LBC’s Nick Ferrari from 7pm, in front of about 1,400 Conservative party members in the event hosted by the party. Sunak earlier admitted he was the underdog in the contest, and polling has shown he is trailing his opponent with Tory members. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, told Times Radio this afternoon that Boris Johnson was entitled to mock Rishi Sunak earlier over his U-turn on removing VAT on fuel bills. (See 1pm.) Rees-Mogg said: I think the prime minister was puzzled as to why that wasn’t policy earlier in the year when the prime minister and other members of the cabinet, including me, thought it was an extremely good idea but it wasn’t so popular in 11 Downing Street. So times change and we change with them, as they say. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Harry Taylor is taking over now. In his LBC phone-in this morning, Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said he had no plans to join a picket line in the near future “simply because of pressure of work and stuff”. But he said he had no objection in principle to appearing on a picket line. Asked if he would join an RMT picket in the coming days, he said: I have in the past appeared on picket lines and I think it’s really important to make sure we understand that actually the genesis of all these problems, the root cause of all these problems, are government policies. It’s either the government pulling the strings of the rail companies or not giving – whether it’s the rail companies, whether its TfL, whether it’s the NHS, whether it’s our schools – the money they need to give their workers a decent pay rise. Khan said unions had been “a core force for good to our country over the recent weeks, months and years” and, as an example, he said everyone had benefited from what they had done during the pandemic to keep public transport safe. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are poised to go head to head in the first official hustings with Tory members in Leeds, PA Media reports. PA says: It is the first of 12 sessions for party faithful across the country to quiz the final two candidates before voting for the next party leader and prime minister closes on 2 September. The two-hour hustings will be broadcast on LBC radio from 7pm and hosted by presenter Nick Ferrari. The event takes place in Leeds, where Truss was hoping to shore up voters’ support by backing Northern Powerhouse Rail in full and pledging to “turbocharge investment” into the north of England. During a visit to the Yorkshire city, Truss insisted she is “completely committed” to the scheme to improve rail connections between Liverpool and Leeds, which was originally announced by Boris Johnson but subsequently scaled back. She told reporters: “I grew up in Leeds, I know how poor the transport is and, frankly, it’s not got much better since I was a teenager getting the bus into Leeds city centre. What I want to see is really fantastic rail services, better roads so people are able to get into work”. Asked how she would afford the scheme, given the vast tax cuts she has pledged, Truss said: “The taxes that I am cutting are affordable within our budget. By creating new low-tax investment zones in places like West Yorkshire, by enabling the post-Brexit reforms to take place, unleashing more investment from the city, we will grow the economy faster - that will bring in more tax revenue, and that will enable us to afford those projects”. She also promised to “fix the Treasury’s funding formula” if she gets the keys to No 10 to make sure the region gets a “fairer share” of resources. Truss took a thinly veiled swipe at Sunak, who is the MP for the North Yorkshire seat of Richmond, when she was asked whether he was as committed to the rail project, saying: “The thing about me is I’m prepared to take on the Whitehall orthodoxy, I’m prepared to challenge the groupthink that has, over decades, not put enough investment into this part of the country.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency and Brexit opportunities, has opened a government hub building in Birmingham that will house up to 1,700 civil servants, from 20 government departments. This is part of a project that will see jobs relocated outside London. Some 880 jobs have already been moved to the West Midlands, the Cabinet Office says, and 2,100 will be relocated by 2025. Rees-Mogg said: “This hub is an important part of our plans to create a leaner and more efficient public estate, which will save taxpayers’ money and serve the entire United Kingdom.” There are two long interviews with Rishi Sunak out today. He has spoken to Charles Moore for a Spectator interview, and to Andrew Gimson and William Atkinson for a ConservativeHome one. Here are the main points. Sunak said the Conservative party should negotiate a protocol for leadership debates with broadcasters to minimise the risk of debates damaging the party’s reputation. He told ConHome: I think there might be an argument for the party negotiating on behalf of all candidates together with the broadcasters. That might be a sensible thing if the party sets the rules of the contest in general. Because there’s two competing things we’re trying to balance. One is a genuine need for scrutiny of candidates, and that is entirely reasonable and fair, because ultimately this person is going to become prime minister. But that need for scrutiny needs to be balanced with need as well to make sure that our party is not doing things that essentially write Labour’s next leaflets for them. He implied that he would prefer to negotiate a solution to the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol with the EU than go ahead with implementing the NI protocol bill, that allows the UK government to unilaterally ignore parts of the protocol. He told the Spectator: There are some very real challenges with the arrangements that are in place currently. I’d like to see those fixed and the protocol bill gives us an opportunity to do that. But the door should always be there for a negotiated settlement with Europe, not least because it is a lot faster. He refused to describe Boris Johnson as a liar in his Spectator interview, but, explaining why he resigning from government, he said Johnson was not telling the truth about the Chris Pincher affair. Asked if Johnson was lying, Sunak said: It’s unclear exactly what happened, but it was clear to me that what was said was not accurately reflective of what seemed to have happened. Sunak told the Spectator that his campaign launch video was put together in 24 hours. The video was so polished that it was widely assumed it could not have been produced that quickly. But Sunak told the Spectator: I can honestly say with hand on heart that that video was put together in 24 hours. And I get a lot of criticism when people say: ‘Oh, gosh, it’s all very slick and professional.’ I think being professional is a good thing. I think being professional at things is something that we should celebrate and actually we need more of it. He rejected claims that he was the candidate of orthodox thinking. He told the Spectator that, when economic orthodoxy said the government could go on borrowing lavishly because interest rates would stay low, he did not accept that, because he thought they were bound to rise. He told ConHome that it was “pretty clear” that he was the underdog in the contest. He said: I think it’s pretty clear I’m the underdog. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. Jake Berry, the Conservative MP who chairs the Northern Research Group, which represents Tory MPs in the north, has declared that he is backing Liz Truss for the leadership. His endorsement coincides with Truss saying she will build Northern Powerhouse Rail if she becomes PM, as my colleague Josh Halliday reports. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has expressed concern about Keir Starmer’s decision to sack Sam Tarry. In an interview with GB News, Burnham said there was a risk of the party appearing not to be on the side of working people. Commenting on the sacking of Tarry, he said: Labour needs to be careful here. We can’t ever be a party that undermines working people fighting to protect their incomes and a cost of living crisis. If we’re not careful, that’s how we might come over. There’s a real issue out there now for people in terms of wages and energy bills that keep rising. People are going to have to fight to protect their incomes and Labour should be supporting people to protect their incomes. Starmer insists that Tarry was sacked not because he showed his support for striking RMT members, but because he gave interviews in which he contradicted party policy. (See 1.11pm.) Kevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser for the train drivers’ union Aslef, has announced that he has resigned from the Labour party following the sacking yesterday of Sam Tarry. Lindsay also says he will now be backing calls for the union to disaffiliate from Labour. In his resignation letter to the party he said: The Labour party was and is meant to be the political wing of the trade union movement but now it’s more interested in trying woo Tory voters in the shires of England than representing working people. As a democrat, I respect that Keir Starmer has been elected the leader but I truly believe his performance and policies are making it impossible for the Labour party to return to power and that he should be removed from his position immediately. There needs to be a change in leadership and political direction but I sadly can’t see this happening and we will end up with PM Truss for several years. Therefore I have made the decision not only to resign from the Labour party but now also support the proposal for Aslef to disaffiliate from the party. And here are some more lines from what Keir Starmer said to reporters during his Birmingham visit when asked about his approach to trade unions and strikes. Starmer said he would take “each case as it comes” when deciding whether to allow frontbenchers to join picket lines. In the past shadow ministers have been told not to appear on picket lines. Asked if they could support RMT pickets during the strike on Saturday, provided they did not give unauthorised interviews, Starmer replied: “We take each case as it comes. I want to see these issues resolved.” He also said the role of a “responsible government” was to get the key players around the table to resolve the issues. He said that Liz Truss was “completely wrong” in wanting to further curtail the ability of trade unions to hold strikes. Asked about her plans, he said: I think she’s completely wrong about that. What we need to do is to improve the rights of working people. That’s why we’ve drafted a whole set of employment rights from day one for working people. He refused to say whether he would back calls for a general strike if Truss tried to implement her plans. But he said unions were right to stick up for their members. Asked about the prospect of some sort of coordinated strike action (see 9.58am), and whether he would approve, he said: It’s quite right for trade unions to stick up for their members and to fight for their members. Of course, it is. And it’s their members who are really struggling under this cost-of-living crisis. So, of course, trade unions are right to stick up for support and negotiate on behalf of their members. I’m fully supportive of that, working with our trade unions. He said the trade unions would “always” be part of the labour movement. He said he expected the Unite union to continue to have a relationship with the Labour party. Unite is Labour’s biggest donor and its general secretary, Sharon Graham, has been particularly critical of the decision to sack Sam Tarry. She posted these messages on Twitter yesterday. Asked if he was worried about Unite withdrawing funding from the party, Starmer said: The Unite union and the Labour party have a very strong relationship. I am a member of the Unite union. That relationship is historic, it is present, and it will be the future of the Labour party. They work with us on our employment rights’ draft legislation, which is, you know, the most comprehensive set of employment rights that we have ever seen coming out of the Labour party. Keir Starmer has said Sam Tarry was sacked as shadow transport minister because he “made up policy on the hoof”. Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Starmer said: Sam Tarry was sacked because he booked himself onto media programmes without permission, and then made up policy on the hoof, and that can’t be tolerated in any organisation because we’ve got collective responsibility. So that was relatively straightforward. Of course, as far as the industrial action is concerned, I completely understand the frustration of so many working people who’ve seen the prices go up, seen inflation through the roof, and their wages haven’t gone up. So the Labour party will always be on the side of working people, but we need collective responsibility, as any organisation does. Starmer was referring in particular to an interview Tarry gave yesterday in which he said people like rail workers should not get below-inflation pay rises. That is not party policy. Boris Johnson has mocked Rishi Sunak, his former chancellor, for announcing a U-turn this week and proposing to scrap VAT on fuel bills for a year. In a speech at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Birmingham, the outgoing prime minister acknowledged that he was leaving office sooner than he wanted. He told his audience: We come now to the next stage in the great relay race of politics. I didn’t think it was meant to be a relay race, by the way, when I started. I can assure you that the baton is going to be passed seamlessly and invisibly to the hand of somebody else. I’ll give you this assurance, they will continue with the same programme, cutting taxes, simplifying regulation as much as possible, taking advantage of all our new regulatory freedoms, getting rid of every encumbrance from solvency to MiFID to VAT on fuel - turns out to be easier than we thought. Johnson has said almost nothing in public about the candidates vying to succeed him - even though it is an open secret that he favours Liz Truss. He feels betrayed by Sunak, whose resignation as chancellor precipitated a flood of resignations by ministers and ministerial aides that led to Johnson realising they would have to quit. When Sunak was still at the Treasury, some in No 10 felt he was unreasonably blocking measures that would help people with the cost of living. During the 2016 referendum Johnson said the government would abolish VAT on fuel bills after the UK left the EU, but Sunak blocked proposals to do that earlier this year, arguing that it was better to target help for the poor than implement a tax cut that would be particularly helpful to wealthy people heating large houses. Sunak announced his U-turn on Tuesday night. He said had had changed his mind in the light of evidence that the energy price cap is now expected to rise above £3,000 in October, but the announcement was also interpreted as a panic move from a candidate who fears he is losing. In her interview on the Today programme this morning Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, appeared to play down the impact of the huge rise in fuel costs that people are going to face this winter. When it was put to her that bills would be going up by £2,300 this autum, Dorries replied: “Some, some people’s bills may increase by that amount.” The italics illustrate the words she was stressing. Dorries highlighted measures already taken by the government to help people with their bills. The presenter, Martha Kearney, was quoting a figure provided by Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, in an interview on the programme earlier. As the Manchester Evening News reports, Lewis said: Let’s be absolutely plain here, we know roughly what the price cap is going to be. It is set based on a published algorithm - it is based on wholesale prices. The October price cap is based on prices between February and mid-August so we’re nearly at the end of that. And the current prediction is prices will rise 77% on top of the 52% rise we saw in April, taking the typical bill to £3,500 a year, that’s with the prediction I go for. Others are saying it will go higher we’re expecting it to rise again in January. Now what that means year on year from last October to this October, a typical house will be paying £2,300 a year more on their energy bills alone. These are from the consumer journalist Harry Wallop. Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies, a rightwing thinktank, and one of the authors of the 2019 Conservative manifesto, is in despair at Rishi Sunak’s green belt policy. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and Tory leadership candidate, has announced that he would tighten planning rules to further restrict building on the green belt if he be became prime minister. He would also stop local authorities removing land from the green belt. Citing an interview that Liz Truss, his rival, gave in 2019, in which she said 1m homes should be built on the London green belt, Sunak also claimed that this was now a policy area where the difference between the two candidates was “huge”. Under planning rules for England, development can be allowed on the green belt in “very special circumstances”. Sunak says that if a local community judged such development inappropriate, he would not allow that decision to be overruled in any circumstances. He says he would block the “loophole” that allows councils to take some land out of the green belt so that it can be freed up for development. As a result, the green belt has shrunk by 1%, he says. But he also says he would change planning rules to make building on brownfield sites easier. In a statement he says: Green belt land is extremely precious in the UK. Over the last few years we’ve seen too many examples of local councils circumventing the views of residents by taking land out of the green belt for development, but I will put a stop to it. Under my plans, if a local community has clearly judged a development to be inappropriate there are no circumstances in which planning permission should be granted. More homes can be built while protecting the green belt and our most precious landscapes. Data shows that well over a million homes could be built across the country on brownfield sites with particularly high capacity in the north-west, Yorkshire and the West Midlands. These places are crying out for new homes and a combination of building here and more inner-city densification will help us provide the housing that the UK needs, whilst protecting the countryside around our towns and cities. Drug-related deaths in Scotland fell by nine in 2021, according to the latest figures released by National Records of Scotland, the first decrease since 2013 but falling well short of the significant reduction that campaigners are calling for. The latest figure of 1,330 is still the second highest annual total on record, and Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe and five times the rate in England. The figures reveal a number of local rises in Edinburgh from 92 to 109 and Dumfries and Galloway from 22 to 35 and Glasgow 291 to 311, while deaths of women increased by 8% to 397. Responding to the figures, the SNP MP Stewart McDonald said the figures were still “eye-watering”. Angela Constance, the Scottish government’s minister for drugs policy, a dedicated position created by Nicola Sturgeon in December 2020 after the first minster admitted her government had “taken its eye off the ball”, said the number of deaths remained “unacceptable” and that work would continue “at pace” to address the public health emergency. But other campaigners pointed to a “massive accountability gap” around quality and availability of services. Justina Murray, CEO of Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs said she was calling for a target of zero drug deaths, saying anything less was an “insult”. She said: We’ve had a raft of reports, policies and strategies that say what needs to change, and families are more likely to be included round the table, but it’s much harder to track their influence on the ground. We don’t understand what’s getting in the way of good words becoming good deeds. Last week, Scotland’s drugs deaths taskforce published a hard-hitting report condemning “woefully inadequate” underfunding of services. The Scottish Labour MSP Paul Sweeney, who has launched member’s bill to establish overdose prevention centres, where addicts can take drugs with support and supervision, said: 1,330 of our fellow Scots have died entirely preventable deaths and we should not be celebrating this as an achievement ... The solutions are no secret. We need action, not reports with recommendations that are never implemented. On Tuesday, explaining his decision to order Labour frontbenchers not to join RMT picket lines, Keir Starmer said: “The Labour party in opposition needs to be the Labour party in power. And a government doesn’t go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes.” But in the late 1970s, when Labour was in government, government ministers did join picket lines, at the Grunwick dispute, John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, writes in an article for the Guardian. He says: I went with our CLP delegation regularly. It was a tough and, at times, violent dispute as the police escorted a bus full of scabs brought in by the company to break the strike and teach the women a lesson. The Labour and trade union movement came together as one to campaign against the exploitation of these women. Joining the picket lines to show solidarity were some of the most prominent members of the movement, and among those who joined the women’s picket line were Labour cabinet ministers. Not shadow ministers but cabinet ministers actually serving in government at the time, including, famously, Shirley Williams. McDonnell says Starmer’s decision to ban frontbencher from joining picket lines is “a complete misreading of the mood within the Labour and trade union movement but also among the general public”. He says: In terms of the general public, the reason that there is an unprecedented level of sympathy for these strikes is not just down to the impressive straight-talking eloquence of the RMT’s Mick Lynch. It’s because millions are being hit by the same cost of living crisis, which has become the key mobilising factor in the massive wave of industrial disputes that is currently building. The risk is that when the millions involved go to the polls next, they will be asking the question of the Labour leader, where were you when we needed you? Whatever diktats from the Labour leader’s office, there is a weightier responsibility on the shoulders of Labour members, whatever position they hold. It is to stand up for one another in the Labour and trade union movement in this summer of solidarity. You can read the full McDonnell article here. And here are some more lines from what Liz Truss has been saying to reporters on her visit in Leeds. Truss hinted that she might reconsider government plans to privatise Channel 4. Asked if she would go ahead with the privatisation as PM, she replied: I believe that, where possible, it’s best to have companies operating in the private sector rather than the public sector. I will look in detail at the business case on Channel 4, but one thing I’m absolutely committed to is it staying in Leeds. Rishi Sunak, Truss’s rival for the Tory leadership, has said he would definitely go ahead with the privatisation. She said she would not commit to restoring plans for HS2 to go to Leeds. She said: What I’m committing to today is Northern Powerhouse Rail. I grew up in Leeds, I know how poor the local transport is. What people need is good routes to commute into work. That is where there is a real issue for people getting into work around West Yorkshire ... I’m not going to commit to restoring that leg of HS2 [to Leeds]. She said it was “not time for another windfall tax” on energy companies to help with energy bills. She defended her plans to curb the ability of unions to hold strikes, saying she would “put through legislation making sure that essential services are provided on our railways”. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has rejected claims that the Foreign Office under her leadership lacked expertise in Russia. The claim is made in a report into how the Foreign Office operates published by the Institute for Government thinktank. My colleague Patrick Wintour has written it up here. Speaking to reporters on a trip to Leeds, Truss said the claim that the Foreign Office was short of experts on Russia was “completely untrue”. She went on: We have led the world in standing up to Russia. We were the first country to send weapons to Ukraine in Europe, we put the toughest sanctions on Russia of any country, and we’re also making sure that nobody is allowing Ukraine’s sovereign territory to be given up, and we’ve worked with our allies to achieve that. I’m proud of our record, but we need to do more, and one of the key areas in bringing down the cost of living is dealing with Russia - making sure they can’t hold the world to ransom over their gas supplies - and I will be tough in standing up to Putin. Here is an extract from the report explaining why the IfG thinks Russia has been neglected by the Foreign Office. This is just one of several areas where the IfG thinks the department’s performance could improve. The Institute has argued that the war in Ukraine requires the UK, and democratic nations more generally, to review its approach to Russia. But this is hindered by the relatively small team dedicated to it. This is not new; as many interviewees for this paper noted, and observers have commented publicly, after the Cold War there was a ‘moment of hope’ and a belief that the worst of the Russian threat had passed. Diplomatic expertise on the countries of the former Soviet Union was reduced. Ambitious members of the Foreign Office specialised in other fields, such as the Middle East and China. This decline in expertise on Russia and its neighbours was noted in 2014 after Russia’s invasion of Crimea by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former UK ambassador to Moscow, who said: “When the [Crimea] crisis happened, there was a problem in the Foreign Office; the old Cold War cadre of people just wasn’t there.” By 2016 the comparative lack of resources dedicated to Russia was well-established. Between 2016 and 2022, the Eastern Europe and Central Asia unit was consistently among the worst resourced of the geographical units in the FCO and then FCDO. The number of UKB staff at the embassy in Moscow has also been slowly reduced; exact numbers are not available for recent years, but staff numbers fell from 30 in 2016/17 to somewhere in the 20s in 2020/21. Other elements of the Foreign Office’s Russian expertise have continued to be downgraded. Despite the Foreign Affairs Committee drawing attention to Russian language proficiency as a ‘weak spot’ in 2015, the number of staff in the department who could speak it at ‘advanced’ level dropped from 83 in December 2017 to below 60 in February 2022. More than 100,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have received sanctuary in the UK through its visa schemes, PA Media reports. PA says: Some 104,000 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes as of Monday, figures published by the Home Office and UK Visas and Immigration show. This includes 31,300 people under the family scheme, and 72,700 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The figures also show that, as of Tuesday, around 198,200 applications have been made for visas, and 166,200 visas have been issued. These include 55,000 applications under the family scheme, of which 47,200 visas have been granted, and 143,200 applications under the sponsorship scheme, of which 119,000 visas have been granted. Yesterday Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretry, suggested that if Liz Truss becomes prime minister, and tries to implement her plans to restrict the ability of trade unions to call strikes, the union movement should respond with a 1926-style general strike. In his interview on Sky News this morning, John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, was asked if he would support a general strike. He suggested he would, saying it was sensible for unions to coordinate action. He said: If you look at the ballots that are taking place across the trade union movement, we are talking about millions of workers now voting for industrial action. So, naturally, what people are saying as well, why not coordinate that? I support co-ordinated action, because if that results in a decent pay rise for people, they are protected against the cost-of-living crisis. I think that’s the most effective thing to do. McDonnell said the strikes would not be necessary if workers were paid properly. But, because the government was not listening, coordinated strike action was “inevitable”, he claimed. He said: But, you know, this is completely unnecessary. What it needs is the government to recognise that you can’t expect people to stand on one side when their wages are being cut ... You can understand why unions are saying that if we are going to strike, we might as well coordinate that action. So coordinated action, I think, is going to be inevitable, and I just hope that the government starts listening. Nadine Dorries has suggested in another interview this morning that Rishi Sunak was part of a “coup” that brought down Boris Johnson, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. Boris Johnson wants his supporters to abandon their campaign to get Conservative HQ to give party members a vote on whether he should be allowed to stay on as leader. It is claimed that more than 10,000 members have signed a petition saying. members should get a vote on whether or not Johnson has resigned. But so far the party has not taken any notice, and CCHQ believes some of the people who have signed are not genuine members anyway. In an interview with the Today programme Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, who is close to Johnson, said she had recently discussed this with the prime minister. Johnson told her, “Tell them to stop, it’s not right,” she said. Dorries went on: “They were his words, his exact words.” She also claimed that a report in the Daily Mirror suggesting that she might vacate her Mid Bedfordshire seat, where she has a majority of almost 25,000, to make way for Johnson was “100% nuclear grade tosh”. The Mirror says that the idea had been discussed because Johnson wants to stay in the Commons, and hopes that he may get a chance to lead the Tories again, but feels he needs a safe seat. Currently he represents Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he had a majority of 7,210 at the last election but where a big swing to Labour could see him lose. In her Mirror story Pippa Crerar writes: Mr Johnson’s personal appeal with Tory voters in his West London seat, a popular local Conservative council and strong grassroots campaigners should, in theory, make ousting the top Tory a difficult task. However, modelling earlier this month from Britain Elects predicted that Labour could get 43.7% of the vote in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, an increase of 6.1% on 2019, if there was an election held today. Mr Johnson’s vote share would drop by 11.5%, giving him just 41.1% of the vote. Labour and Lib Dem voters have shown themselves willing to vote tactically in recent by-elections while constituency boundary changes would add Northolt, regarded as a Labour area, to the seat. Young professional graduates who are more likely to vote against the Tories have been moving in droves out of central London to suburbs like Hillingdon. Good morning. Tonight Liz Truss will compete with Rishi Sunak at the first of the official hustings being organised by the Conservative party for members. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary and Truss supporter, has been on the broadcast round this morning and, despite reportedly being told by Truss’s team to tone down her comments about Sunak, she has found it hard to resist, and her interviews have included various studs up attacks on the former chancellor. On LBC she accused him of “mansplaining” in the BBC debate on Monday, and said it was a “terrrible look”. And on BBC Breadkfast she defended her decision to have a go at him over his expensive clothes, saying “it’s about judgment, and it’s about who voters can relate to”. But the Labour party is going through a bout of internal fighting too, triggered by Keir Starmer’s decision last night to sack Sam Tarry as shadow transport minister after he joined an RMT picket line (defying orders from Starmer) and then proceeded to give a series of interviews that had not been authorised by the leadership and in which he flatly contradicted party policy on public sector pay (the real reason why he was sacked, Labour says). My colleague Jessica Elgot has all the details here. As Jess reports, union leaders have criticised Starmer’s move, arguing that it shows Labour is not committed to standing up for working people. This morning leftwingers in the parliamentary party have also accused Starmer of double standards, saying that Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, also gave an interview this week in which she departed form party policy, but that she was not sacked. Reeves said Labour was opposed to rail renationalisation, but later the party said that remained its policy. John McDonnell, shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, told Sky News: Rachel Reeves went on an interview and made up policy on rail nationalisation which had to be contradicted by the shadow spokesperson on transport within hours. I didn’t see Rachel Reeves being sacked. Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary under Corbyn, made the same argument in an interview on the Today programme. McDonnell also told Sky News that Starmer had generated a “completely unnecessary row”. He said: Just at a time when the Tories are tearing themselves apart, and we’ve got the maximum opportunity, I think, to gain an advantage in the polls that will build the support to take us into a government, we’re having this completely unnecessary row. Sam went on the picket lines like shadow minister after shadow minister over the years in support of workers who are asking for a decent pay rise. It’s a just cause ... The Tory leadership election is demonstrating how the Tories are ripping themselves apart. This is the time where we should have maximum unity and maximum solidarity for the support for workers who are desperate to have a decent pay rise because they’ve been impacted upon so badly by this cost of living crisis. The Tory hustings does not start until 7pm this evening. There is not a lot in the diary until then, although Starmer is on a visit in Birmingham, and Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, is doing a phone-in on LBC at 10am. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

Biden is in the restoration business. The US will quickly rejoin the Paris climate change agreement and the World Health Organization. He will offer closer cooperation with allies in Europe and Asia and, as the Covid-19 vaccine rollout accelerates, he plans a big stimulus package to revive the US economy. The appointments Biden makes to his cabinet presage a return to multilateralism and a re-set of the rules-based international order. His flagship initiative is a new “alliance of democracies”. This appears intended to counter China while avoiding head-on confrontation with Beijing. Ties with other authoritarian regimes, such as Saudi Arabia, will be frostier. New trade deals, such as that sought by the UK, are on hold pending a US recovery, he says. Biden’s honeymoon will be brief. Unless Democrats win both run-off elections in Georgia on 5 January and gain control of the US Senate, the president-elect may struggle to make his legislative mark. He must contend with a conservative-dominated supreme court where a battle looms over abortion rights. Those hoping for swift action on police violence, and racism in general, may be disappointed – and may turn against him. Biden faces three personal political challenges in 2021: the “stolen election” myth peddled by Donald Trump, who – if he stays out of jail – will use TV platforms and his fanbase to de-legitimise his successor; leftwing Democrats opposed to his centrist policies; and nagging questions about his health, which, at the age of 78, could become a distraction. February Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Turkey Turkey’s president, who will turn 67 in February and is celebrating 20 years since he founded the ruling Justice and Development party, is the archetypal elected “strongman”. The global power struggle between such leaders and reformist, pro-democracy forces from Peru and Thailand to Belarus and Hong Kong will characterise 2021. Like many such leaders, Erdoğan runs an aggressive foreign policy intended to whip up nationalist-patriotic sentiment and distract from domestic problems. Thus the year will see more violence against Kurds in Syria and more Turkish meddling in Libya, the Balkans and the Caucasus. Yet Trump’s departure, and Biden’s less sympathetic approach, may encourage Erdoğan to patch up relations with the EU, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Copycat authoritarians seem unbowed despite the loss of the defeated US president’s patronage. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may soon succeed the ailing 85-year-old King Salman. At least MBS does not pretend to be a democrat. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, claims a bogus mandate for ever more repressive, incompetent rule, as do Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte. None of them will have it all their own way in 2021. India’s Narendra Modi is another elected autocrat who has successfully replicated the populist majoritarian model. Modi, too, may face growing domestic pushback in 2021. The success of such leaders arises in part from western connivance, indifference or realpolitik. Notwithstanding Biden, there’s scant reason to believe this will change significantly. March Bashar al-Assad Syria Syria’s catastrophic civil war will be 10 years old in March. Its cities have been destroyed, its people killed or displaced in their millions, and yet still the dictator, Bashar al-Assad, survives. Pressure to prosecute him and other war criminals will grow in 2021. But Assad can still count on Russia and Iran to protect him. A final military push this spring in Idlib, the last province outside regime control, threatens a new refugee catastrophe. This year will also mark 20 years of war in Afghanistan, dating back to the 11 September 2001 attacks. Peace talks between the government and Taliban will probably stumble on, even as fighting escalates. Biden wants to get out but will not do so without a credible peace deal. As the Taliban pushes for total victory, that may prove as elusive as ever. And as ever, neighbours and rivals India and Pakistan will try to shape any settlement. For people living in other conflict zones, 2021 will be a year of living dangerously. Hopes are rising that another “forever war”, in Libya, may be nearer resolution after a ceasefire was agreed last autumn. If all goes well, elections could be held this year. But the country remains a proxy battleground for regional states. The Yemen conflict could also begin to wind down if, as pledged, Biden obliges the Saudis to pull back. Meanwhile, Ethiopia enters 2021 fighting a pointless “whatever war” in Tigray. April Emmanuel Macron France It’s four years this month since a young political upstart, Emmanuel Macron, narrowly won the first round of France’s presidential election and went on to seize the Élysée. In April 2022, Macron will face voters again. Prominent among the issues on which he will be judged will be his record as a champion of French secularism – laïcité – and his handling of Islamist terrorism and “separatism”. Unlike other western leaders, Macron offers an ideological rebuttal of extremists’ attempts to divide people by religious belief, upholding the egalitarian, republican principle of universal citizenship. Critics say his stance has provoked the jihadists. France has suffered a string of attacks by individuals or small terror cells. 2021 may bring similar horrors there and elsewhere. Overall, however, the frequency of Islamist terror attacks in Europe declined in 2020, according to the Global Terrorism Index, and this downward trend may continue in 2021. Syria, Iraq and the wider Arab world have also seen reduced Islamist violence. The main focus in 2021, especially for Islamic State (Isis) affiliates, will be sub-Saharan Africa, notably Mozambique, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and northern Nigeria, where a resurgent Boko Haram has been terrorising rural areas. The coming year may also see a continuation of recent increases in far-right and white supremacist violence in Europe and the US, where it has become a bigger threat than jihadism. The rise, fanned by populist politicians and fuelled by social alienation, inequality, poor education and racial hatred, could be exacerbated by the pandemic. May Nicola Sturgeon Scotland Britain faces a daunting triple challenge in 2021: halting the Covid-19 nightmare while attempting an economic recovery; dealing with post Brexit chaos; and avoiding a constitutional crisis and the break-up of the United Kingdom. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will play a key role in all three dramas, but it is the latter – her Scottish National party’s drive for independence – that may dominate as the year goes on. If, as expected, the SNP sweeps to victory in May’s Scottish parliament elections, the drive for a second referendum will be on, but UK prime minister Boris Johnson insists he will not allow another vote. No one knows what might happen then. Some point to Catalonia, which held an independence referendum in 2017 in defiance of Spain’s government. That ended badly. Sturgeon is popular, but many Scots say health and the post-Brexit, post-Covid economy are more pressing issues than independence. Johnson will face more political storms. This year will be Britain’s first fully outside the EU since 1973, and the country looks chronically unprepared. His mishandling of the pandemic destroyed Johnson’s public standing. 2021 will be a bumpy year for him. June Hassan Rouhani Iran Iran’s presidential election on 18 June and the departure of the two-term incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, who cannot stand again, could be a turning point for the Middle East. Rouhani was a disappointment. He failed to deliver promised reforms and oversaw a period of domestic repression and economic recession caused by Covid, corruption and US sanctions. But at least he was not against dialogue with the west. That window is closing. The discrediting of Rouhani’s moderate, pragmatic approach has given Iran’s diehard anti-western conservatives and military chiefs their chance. If their candidate (no one has yet been selected) wins the presidency, it could scupper hopes of a fresh start with Tehran. Hossein Dehghan, a top Revolutionary Guard Corps commander and adviser to the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is a hot tip. Much hinges region-wide on the character of the post-Rouhani era. Iran’s confrontation with Israel, waged through proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Gaza, may intensify if hardliners take charge. So, too, could the regional contest with the Arab Gulf states as Saudi Arabia debates whether to follow the UAE and Bahrain in making peace with Israel. Iran’s moderates hope an early offer of sanctions relief from Biden will turn the election their way. This year may see another big Middle East moment: the political demise of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, who faces bribery and fraud charges and whose governing coalition is tottering. Yet no matter who succeeds him, there may be further erosion of Palestinian hopes of an independent state as more Arab countries cut deals with Israel and each other. July Xi Jinping China This month marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist party by, among others, Mao Zedong. China’s modern-day Mao, de facto president-for-life Xi Jinping, exercises possibly even greater personal power. Under his direction China has moved from “peaceful rise” to aggressive would-be hegemon. 2021 will see increasingly coordinated western push-back. China’s attempts to bully middle-ranking countries such as Australia and Canada by taking hostages and blocking imports, its sneering contempt for declining post-colonial European powers such as the UK, and its new willingness to defy major competitors such as India and the US presages a tough year of deepening friction on a wide range of fronts. Flashpoints include Beijing’s attacks on democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan; its military buildup, especially in the South China Sea and Himalayas; human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet; the global expansion of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei; western trade sanctions and protectionism; and strategic competition for resources and influence in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America – as well as in outer space. The intense debate in Britain about engagement with China – specifically over Chinese investment in critical security infrastructure such as communications and nuclear power – will be mirrored across Europe, where Beijing is wooing disaffected EU members and non-EU Balkan countries such as Serbia. Biden says he wants to cool things down. But he will not lift sanctions until the US economy is stronger and US-led coalitions are assembled to play Beijing at its own global game. August António Guterres United Nations The rescheduled 2020 Olympics – the ultimate symbol and practical manifestation of one-world internationalism – will reach a climax in Tokyo in August, assuming the Games are not delayed again. The spirit of global cooperation will be needed more than ever in 2021 as the world struggles to recover from the pandemic. Leading the comeback fight is António Guterres, the UN secretary-general. Wealthier countries may find their own ways to escape Covid, but it falls to Guterres and the UN’s agencies to try to ensure everyone else is eventually safe. A record 235 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2021, a 40% increase that the UN attributes almost entirely to Covid-19. The world must “stand with people in their darkest hour of need”, Guterres says – and wants $35bn to pay for it. Unfair competition for effective, affordable vaccines may hinder that aim. The independent People’s Vaccine Alliance predicts people in up to 70 lower-income countries will lose out in 2021’s coming “vaccine race”. The Norwegian Refugee Council estimates that 40 million people are at increased risk of discrimination and rights abuses, including human trafficking and child recruitment – part of a Covid-created “coping crisis”. The number of refugees settled in safe countries is at a record low. All this comes on top of existing challenges such as water shortages that will affect more than 3 billion people in 2021, half of them severely, as a result of rising demand and climate breakdown. Six countries – Afghanistan, Yemen, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and South Sudan – face famine in 2021. September Angela Merkel Germany Federal elections in September will mark the political retirement of Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor since 2005 and the first woman to hold the job. Her departure will be a watershed for Germany and Europe. The race to succeed her as leader of the Christian Democrats will climax this month. September’s elections could bring big changes. Attention will focus in particular on the Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany. The loss of Merkel as a steadying, unifying influence will be felt keenly within the EU, especially on touchstone issues such as eurozone alignment, Europe’s budget and Nato. France’s Macron champions a vision of a stronger, more integrated “global Europe” that fights for its values and interests. Merkel often applied a brake. As she bows out and French elections approach, Franco-German tensions may spill into the open. Support for European far-right populist parties has appeared to slip of late but they will remain an important factor in 2021, not least in the unresolved debate over migration. In successfully defying the Brussels commission on rule of law and gender and media freedom issues, the illiberal Polish and Hungarian governments set a bad example that others may follow. With a new US administration focused primarily on domestic problems, with China’s tanks metaphorically parked on its lawn, and with Russia playing the neighbour from hell, Europe faces a year of challenges that could further test its unity. Does it throw itself back into Washington’s arms, try to hold the ring between the US and China, or go it alone? Does it create a “two-speed” EU? These big questions could nevertheless be overshadowed by the extended battle against Covid and, to a lesser degree, fallout from the Brexit fiasco. October Vladimir Putin Russia Vladimir Putin was born in St Petersburg, then Leningrad, on 7 October 1952, 35 years after the October Revolution that eventually produced the Soviet Union. This year marks 30 years since the USSR imploded. The former KGB spook has spent his political career since 1999 as prime minister and president, trying – and failing – to resurrect the Soviet empire. Putin may need a second October revolution to hold present-day Russia together. He appears secure after a rigged constitutional referendum theoretically allowed him two more six-year presidential terms. But Putin looks tired and isolated. He has cut himself off during the pandemic. His popularity is falling. Oil revenue, Russia’s life-blood, has plunged. He and his allies face difficult parliamentary elections in September amid mounting economic problems and unrest in Russia’s far east. The bungled attempt to poison Putin’s best-known challenger, Alexei Navalny, strengthened domestic opposition. Meanwhile, Putin’s efforts to reconquer Russia’s “near abroad” are unravelling. Belarus’s popular uprising refuses to be quelled. Anti-Moscow, pro-democracy sentiment is strong in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. The recent Armenia-Azerbaijan war exposed the limits of Russian power. Syria is a quagmire he cannot escape. After two decades of land-grabs, assassinations, rampant corruption and subversion, Putin has few international allies. Russia is under EU and US sanctions. Trump, always oddly deferential, is gone. Western countries mostly regard Putin with fear and loathing. Talk of a military alliance with China reflects his weakness. In short, he looks vulnerable. In October, Russia will send its first spacecraft to the moon for 45 years. Perhaps Putin should get on it. November Jair Bolsonaro Brazil The UK will host the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow in November, hoping to give fresh impetus to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It will not be a moment too soon. Human beings continue to inflict extraordinary damage on the planet, UN chief António Guterres says. “Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes.” He wants all governments to declare a state of climate emergency in 2021. At the forefront of humankind’s “suicidal war on nature” is Brazil’s rightwing populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, who epitomises climate change denial at its most destructive. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a vital carbon store that slows global warming, is at its highest level for more than a decade – and has accelerated since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. Such environmental hooliganism may get worse in 2021. Yet there are encouraging signs. The UK will ask other countries to match or beat its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by 2030. The appointment of political heavyweight John Kerry as “climate tsar” suggests the US is fully back on board. In rejoining the Paris accord, Biden promises the US will achieve net zero emissions by 2050. China has set 2060 as its target and says emissions will peak before 2030. Others will take their cue. But 2021 will nevertheless see a speeding up of the race against time that is the climate crisis. Attempts to “build back greener” post-pandemic will collide with vested economic interests. Holding politicians to their climate word, and shaming the likes of Bolsonaro, is perhaps 2021’s most urgent challenge. December Kim Jong-un North Korea It will be exactly 10 years in December 2021 since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, as North Korea’s supreme leader. Trump’s vainglorious efforts to cut a deal with Kim to end his UN-proscribed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes flopped, but Biden lacks new ideas. A worrying question for 2021: will Kim resume nuclear testing? Even bigger, additional challenges over nuclear proliferation will arise this year. Fears that Iran is trying to acquire an atomic bomb may grow, particularly in nuclear-armed Israel. The Saudis may seek parallel nuclear capability in response. Meanwhile, continuing border tensions between nuclear weapons states China and India, and between India and Pakistan, are cause for heightened concern. Biden aims to extend the New Start strategic weapons limitation treaty with Moscow that expires in February. But neither Biden nor anyone else is offering to denuclearise in 2021. Most UN member states have ratified a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons that comes into force on 22 January. It lacks teeth, but it’s a hopeful step."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jan/31/ryanair-omicron-disruption-recovery-china-factories-markets-ftse-oil-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-31T22:25:24Z","webTitle":"Markets post worst month since 2020, as recovery slows and rate hike worries rise – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jan/31/ryanair-omicron-disruption-recovery-china-factories-markets-ftse-oil-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jan/31/ryanair-omicron-disruption-recovery-china-factories-markets-ftse-oil-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets post worst month since 2020, as recovery slows and rate hike worries rise – business live","bodyText":"And finally... the US stock market has closed with strong gains, after a turbulent month in which worries about US interest rate rises, and the Ukraine crisis, hit shares. The S&amp;P 500 has jumped by 1.9% today, led by technology stock such as Netflix and Tesla which both gained over 10%. But that still leaves the S&amp;P 500 down around 5.26% in January, its worst month since March 2020. The Nasdaq surged by 3.4% today, but was still down almost 9% this month --also its worst month since the crash of March 2020. According to Reuters it’s the S&amp;P 500’s worst January drop since 2009, while the Dow had its weakest start to a year since 2016, and it was the Nasdaq’s worst January since 2008. Fears that the US central bank would hike interest rates four or more times this year, even as the economy slows, hit markets hard this month As Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, told CNBC: Between the amount of volumes that we saw and the massive swings that we saw in markets, the volatility really felt like it had a crescendo,” Those crescendos usually happen when there is a massive amount of capitulation in markets and everything is for sale,” Hogan added. “For most of the month we would see money coming out of growth but going into cyclical. Then that would unwind and growth would catch a bit. That was all true until this past week. We’ve seen a bit of the aftermath of that storm, and that seems to be more stabilization.” On that note, goodnight... GW Mexico has fallen into recession, as supply chain disruption, a new labour law and a lack of economic support in the pandemic all hit its economy. Mexico’s GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2021, statistics body INEGI reported, following a 0.4% in Q3. Two consecutive quarters of contraction are a technical recession. Reuters adds: The disappointing Mexico data comes as Brazil’s weakened economy is in danger of sinking deeper into recession this year ahead of October’s presidential election, as anxiety over the vote and steep interest rate rises continue to hurt growth, according to a Reuters poll. “With its weak Q4 outturn, Mexico has joined Brazil in technical recession, an extremely disappointing result that leaves real GDP in Mexico a whopping 4% below its mid-2019 pre-Covid peak,” said Fiona Mackie, regional director, Latin America and the Caribbean at Economist Intelligence Unit. Wall Street continues to finish a shaky January on the front foot - with the Dow up over 0.5% in late trading and the Nasdaq Composite over 2% higher. Many investors will be relieved to put January behind them, though, says Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst: “January stormed in full of optimism that Omicron wouldn’t pack the punch Delta did and that recovery would bring revitalisation for global economies. There will be many investors who’d rather like a do-over, but markets can be unforgiving. Today’s action has been pretty subdued but broadly positive, but whilst the Dow Jones has managed to find a forward gear London’s FTSE ended the day in reverse. But casting around at today’s economic data it’s hard to pin down whether the end of the month leaves up with the glass half full or half empty. “On one hand Germany’s inflation numbers have come down, on the other output from the Chinese manufacturing sector fell to its lowest rates in two years in January, suggesting there’s more choppy water ahead. But then if you look at the Baltic Dry Index it suggests shipping costs are finally on their way down, but according the JLR’s latest and rather disappointing update there’s still no end to the global chip shortage. In a nutshell the world is in post-covid flux and it’s also dealing with a soupçon of nerves about how the situation in the Ukraine will ultimately play out. “Whilst Goldman Sachs has cut its US growth forecast growth stocks seemed very much back in vogue today with the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust topping London’s blue-chip index and Baillie Gifford’s US Growth Trust making decent gains on the FTSE 250 and Tesla and Netflix joining e-commerce Pinduoduo to help push up the Nasdaq. But though the day has been full of tech cheer the month has been a difficult one for the tech heavy index and it’s still down more than 10% since the start of the month, whilst the FTSE 100 has managed to emerge slightly up on where the year started. “February will undoubtedly bring its own tribulations beginning with the Bank of England’s latest rate rise decision. Investors are confident another hike is on the cards but there is also that little seed of doubt until the decision drops. Certainly, the pressure to do something to help cash strapped consumers will weigh heavily but there is a time lag and relief won’t be instant. “ Here’s our news story on the closure of Tesco’s Jack’s discount chain: Back in the UK, food producers and brewers have warned of shortages of meat, beer and fizzy drinks, as well as higher prices, after the government opted not to renew support for the carbon dioxide industry. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said last autumn it had brokered a deal between businesses in the CO2 sector, to ensure supplies of the gas to the food and drink industry, as well as hospitals and nuclear power plants. It came after the government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a short-term bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to prop up the company and stave off supply chain chaos. CF Fertilisers, which is owned by a private firm in the US, had halted production at two of its plants, Billingham on Teesside and Ince in Cheshire, as a result of rocketing prices of gas required to power its operations. However, the three-month deal came to an end on 31 January, and BEIS said it was now up to the CO2 industry to work together. A spokesperson from the department said: “We welcome industry’s agreement in October to ensure CF Fertilisers on Teesside can continue to operate even during the current period of high global gas prices. It is for the CO2 industry to ensure supplies to UK businesses.” Here’s the full story: The financier and philanthropist George Soros has warned tonight that China’s president Xi’s position could be threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the crisis in China’s real estate sector. At an event sponsored by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Soros is explaining that China will try to use the Winter Olympics, which start later this week, as a propaganda victory for its system of strict controls. But, Soros warns, domestic problems could yet prevent Xi from extending his rule to a third term. when the Communist Party chooses its president and general secretary later this year. Soros, who fears Chinese leader Xi poses the “greatest threat” to open societies, argues that China is facing an economic crisis centered on the real estate market. Beijing’s efforts to slow the slow the boom has made it hard for indebted developer Evergrande to meet its obligations, causing a market downturn. In prepared remarks for the event, Soros says: When the main selling season started in September, there were many more sellers than buyers. For a while there were hardly any transactions at the advertised prices, but today prices for both land and apartments are starting to fall. That will turn many of those who invested the bulk of their savings in real estate against Xi Jinping. Evergrande is now in receivership and other developers face a similar fate. The creditors of Evergrande started fighting to improve their position in receiving bankruptcy distributions. The courts took charge, and their first move was to protect the subcontractors who employ some 70 million migrant workers. It remains to be seen how the authorities will handle the crisis. They may have postponed dealing with it for too long, because people’s confidence has now been shaken. Xi Jinping has many tools available to reestablish confidence – the question is whether he will use them properly. In my opinion, the second quarter of 2022 will show whether he has succeeded. The current situation doesn’t look promising for Xi. He also claims that Omicron “threatens to be Xi Jinping’s undoing”, and that Beijing is maintaining its lockdown because its vaccines do not provide protection against the more infectious variant: Xi Jinping has also encountered serious problems with vaccines. The Chinese vaccines were designed to deal with the Wuhan variant, but the world is now struggling with other variants, first Delta and now Omicron. Tesco has abandoned its low-cost “Jack’s” format, launched back in 2018 to take on discount rivals Aldi and Lidl. Britain’s biggest retailer says it will no longer operate its 14 “Jack’s” stores, named after Tesco’s founder Jack Cohen. Six will be converted to Tesco superstores, with the remaining seven earmarked for closure in the coming months. The “Jack’s” stores aimed to be the cheapest in town, by offering a much smaller range than a full Tesco and cutting out frills. But the brand hasn’t really been a success, and only makes up a small fraction of Tesco’s total estate. Some 130 roles in the seven stores that are to close and in head office will be affected by the changes. Tesco says it will try to find staff affected other roles within the company, but unions are Tesco UK and Ireland CEO Jason Tarry says: “With the learnings from Jack’s now applied, the time is right to focus on ensuring we continue to deliver the best possible value for customers in our core business,” Daniel Adams, Usdaw national officer, says staff will be devastated: “Tesco has informed us that they are looking to undertake restructures across the business. Clearly this will be incredibly unsettling for those who may be affected. “We should not forget the role that key workers have played throughout the Coronavirus pandemic and to receive this news is devastating. Tesco is also closing meat, fish or hot deli counters in a further 317 stores. Brexit News: Demands by French customs officials over the type of signature they will accept on post-Brexit paperwork has been blamed by UK business leaders for causing long queues of lorries on approach roads to Dover. Two year after Boris Johnson smiled for the cameras, fountain pen in hand over the EU withdrawal agreement, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said a minor disagreement over signatures on customs paperwork had arisen between Britain and France. William Bain, the head of trade policy at the BCC, said the trade body had heard from UK exporters that French customs officials were demanding a wet signature on border documents for shipments of animals and plant products from the UK. However, he said much of the documentation is produced digitally, creating unexpected holdups on deliveries from Dover to Calais. “One of the issues at Dover currently appears to be linked to the export of food products across the Channel,” Bain said. “Like many of the problems this looks to be down to a differing interpretation of how the trade arrangements work after leaving the EU. “It is the latest in a string of issues with the trade deal that speaks to the wider problems of interpretation, inconsistent application and glaring gaps in its coverage.” Meanwhile on Wall Street, stocks are wrapping up January with a late rally, reversing a little of this month’s damage. The Dow Jones industrial average is now up 0.5%, or 162 points at 34,888, taking its losses this month to just 4%. The tech-focused Nasdaq is charging higher, now up 2.4% today -- but that still leaves the index down 10% for January. The mood in equity markets is a lot more optimistic today than it was last week, and even though the headlines about the Federal Reserve potentially hiking interest rates several times this year are still doing the rounds, says David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. This day last week, European and US indices fell to multi-month lows because of mounting fears about a possible war between Russia and Ukraine, worries about quick monetary tightening from the Fed were a factor too. Over the past week, stock markets have ticked up, and it seems that dealers are getting used to the idea the US central bank will carry out multiple rate hikes this year. The NASDAQ 100 has suffered the most during the recent bearish period due to its large exposure to technology stocks, by contrast the NASDAQ 100 is up over 2% today - its high mark in more than one week. The eurozone economy expanded by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2021, and that was a large drop off from the 2.2% growth posted in the preceding quarter. Economists were expecting 0.4%, it wasn’t a surprise that the growth reading was disappointing seeing as last week it was announced that Germany’s economy contracted by 0.7% in the last three months of the year. It spells trouble for the entire currency bloc if the largest economy is going through a phase of negative growth. European stock markets have recorded their biggest monthly fall in over a year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index, which covers a wide range of European stocks, fell by 3.9% this month - despite a modest rally today. That’s the biggest monthly drop since October 2020, when the Stoxx 600 lost over 5% (just before the news of successful Covid-19 vaccines triggered a global rally). Europe’s technology sector had a particularly poor month, falling by 12% in January. That tracked heavy losses among US tech stocks, as investors anticipated a rise in US interest rates and an end to the cheap money that has boosted fast-growing but unprofitable tech stocks. But the oil sector jumped by 8.5% this month, while bank stocks gained 7.3%. Germany’s DAX has lost 2.6% this month, while France’s CAC slipped by 2.1%. Analysts at Oxford Economists say we are seeing an “overdue correction, not the start of a new bear market”. They say: History would suggest there could be some further downside to come as the average non-recessionary correction is around 15%. However, investor sentiment has already adjusted sharply, and we believe we have now seen the bulk of the move in bond yields. A stalling earnings upgrade cycle has added to investor concerns, but top-line growth is likely to remain robust amidst the ongoing global upswing and the listed corporate sector appears relatively well placed to ride out the monetary tightening cycle. We maintain our modest overweight on the asset class. Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, says the sharp fall in some “high-quality tech firms” are creating opportunities for longer-term investor: Rather than giving up on tech in the face of near-term headwinds, we recommend a more selective approach: balancing away from mega-caps toward companies exposed to artificial intelligence, big data, and cybersecurity—the ABCs of tech—which we see as benefiting most from secular growth.” The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have postponed their planned annual meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, by a year, due to “continuing uncertainty” over the COVID-19 pandemic. The Marrakesh gathering has been pushed back by 12 months, to October 2023, meaning this year’s annual meeting will take place in Washington D.C. This is the second time that the meeting in Marrakesh has been delayed by 12 months due to Covid - it was meant to take place in 2021, before the pandemic disrupted plans. The Annual Meetings are usually held for two consecutive years at the World Bank Group and IMF headquarters in Washington, D.C. and every third year in another member country. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which is more domestically-focused, had a very bruising January. It fell by around 6.7% this month, the worst since March 2020. After a choppy month, the UK’s blue-chip index has ended the day little changed. The FTSE 100 index dipped by 2 points to 7464 points, with mining stocks and UK supermarket chains leading the fallers. Rio Tinto lost 3.7%, Anglo American and Sainsbury’s both fell by 2.8%, while Glencore slipped by 2.6% and Tesco finished 2.1% lower. Investment trust Scottish Mortgage jumped 5%, tracking the recovery in tech stocks, with online grocery firm Ocado 4.3 higher. For the month, the FTSE 100 gained 1% -- rather better than other markets this month.... Growth at factories across Texas slowed to an eight-month low, in another sign that America’s economy has slowed this year. The Dallas Federal Reserve’s latest Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey shows that growth weakened this month. The production index, which measures state manufacturing conditions, came in at 16.6, an eight-month low, down from 26 in December. General business activity, which tracks broader business conditions in the manufacturing sector, dropped to 2.0 from 7.8, the lowest level since July 2020. Measures of capacity utilization and shipments also showed a slowdown in growth. Prices and wages continued to increase strongly in January, though price pressures eased slightly. The survey also shows that factory bosses are more concerned about economic prospects. Uncertainty regarding outlooks escalated further, with the index pushing up 12 points to 30.8, its highest reading since April 2020 after the initial onset of the pandemic. Output from China’s manufacturing sector slowed to its weakest in almost two years in January as the country’s tough anti-Covid measures forced factories into temporary shutdowns. A monthly snapshot of industry in the world’s second biggest economy showed production being hard hit by Beijing’s zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic. The Caixin/Markit purchasing managers’ index dropped from 50.9 in December to 49.1 in January – putting pressure on China’s policymakers to step up support for the flagging economy. A reading below 50 suggests output is contracting rather than expanding, with January’s figure the weakest since February 2020, when blanket restrictions were in force during the first wave of the Covid-19 virus. Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said: “Over the past month, there were Covid-19 flare-ups in several regions in China, underscoring the downward pressure on the economy. “Both supply and demand in the manufacturing sector weakened. Several regions tightened epidemic control measures following the resurgence, which impacted production and sales of manufactured goods. The subindexes for output and total new orders in January fell to their lowest since August. Overseas demand shrank at an even faster pace.” More here: Goldman Sachs has cut its forecast for US growth this year. It has warned that the omicron variant and ongoing supply chain problems will slow the recovery, as the boost from government spending weakens. Reuters has the details: Goldman Sachs cut its GDP forecast in 2022 to 3.2% from a consensus 3.8% as U.S. growth is likely to slow abruptly early in the year as fiscal support fades and the Omicron coronavirus weighs. Goldman now expects annualized real GDP growth in the first quarter of 0.5% versus its previous estimate of 2.0%, as spending on virus-sensitive services declined sharply since early December, the bank said. But the rebound from Omicron is likely to be swift, Goldman said. The final day of a torrid month on the New York stock market is underway... and trading is mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies is down 157 points in early trading at 34,568 points, down 0.45%. Aircraft maker Boeing is the top riser, up 1%, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar is the top faller, down 3%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat, around 4,431 points -- having tumbled around 7% this month. The tech-focused Nasdaq, which has borne the brunt of this month’s selling, has gained 0.7%, but is still down 11% for 2022 so far. The Baltic Exchange’s dry bulk sea freight index, which track shipping costs, is on track for its biggest monthly fall in two years. The Baltic Dry index, a measure of dry bulk material transport costs has dropped by around 36% in January, its fourth monthly fall in a row. Reuters says it’s down to seasonal weakness, and lower iron ore shipments from Australia which have weighed on vessel demand (perhaps as demand from China has softened). The index rose through much of 2021 until peaking in early October (when there was a rush to move goods in time for Christmas and Black Friday), and has dropped sharply since. Other measures of shipping costs are higher, though, highlighting that supply chain disruption has not ended. Inflation in Germany has slowed, but prices continue rise much faster than official targets, new figures show. Consumer prices in Germany were 4.9% higher than the previous year in January, down from 5.3% per year in December, but still more than double the European Central Bank’s goal of 2%. Energy prices remained sharply higher, up 20.5% year-on-year. But inflation was broader based, with goods prices 7.2% over the year and food 5% pricier, while services inflation was 3%. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.4% in January, Destatis reports. Inflation was 5.1% per year on an EU-harmonised basis, down from 5.7%/year in December. America’s tech-focused Nasdaq index is on track for its worst January on record, Bloomberg reports: The Nasdaq Composite Index is headed for the worst start to a year in half-a-century of its existence after the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike plans roiled high-flying technology stocks. The tech-heavy index was down 12% in January as of Friday’s close, worse than the 10% drop in 2008 when the global financial crisis rocked markets worldwide. The selloff comes on the back of a surge in U.S. Treasury yields, hurting pricier tech stocks that are valued on future growth expectations. Futures tracking the elite Nasdaq 100 Index -- an indication of what’s to come at open on the last day of the month -- showed a 0.7% rise, extending their rebound from Friday as earnings beats helped somewhat lessen the Fed blow. But even if the Composite index rises by 1%, it would still be on track for the grim milestone. The oil price is on track for its strongest month in almost a year. Brent crude has jumped 17% in January, as rising demand, tight supplies, and the Ukraine crisis pushed energy prices to seven-year highs. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says crude prices could push higher - which would add to the cost of living squeeze. Brent crude is holding firm above key support at $90, having breached this resistance for the first time since 2014 last week. Robust demand coupled with geopolitical tensions and an OPEC mentality to drip feed supply have all underpinned an upward trendline for Brent and WTI as $100 looks set to be the next major round number resistance to eye ahead.” Back in the City, the early rally has rather fizzled out, as global markets complete their worst month since early in the pandemic. The FTSE 100 index is now slightly lower, with supermarket chains Sainsbury (-3.6%) and Tesco (-2.3%), and miners Rio Tinto (-2.7%) and Fresnillo (-2%) in the fallers. France’s CAC has dipped by 0.25%, while Germany’s DAX is 0.3% higher. Anxiety over Russia-Ukraine tensions, and the prospect of several US interest rate rises this year, have knocked shares this month. Although the FTSE 100 is still 1% higher this year, European markets have dropped this year, with the Stoxx 600 down over 4% in January. Heavy losses in the US, where the S&amp;P 500 was down 7% this year, mean the MSCI World index of shares is down over 6% this month -- which would be its worst month since March 2020 (when markets crashed) Reuters reports: The MSCI World index while higher on Monday, remains down 6.2% in January - the worst start to the year since 2016. Before Friday’s rebound the index was headed for its worst January since the global financial crisis in 2008. Before Friday’s rebound the index was headed for its worst January since the global financial crisis in 2008. “This is not the classic selloff affecting lower quality underperforming companies. This selloff is driven not by fundamentals but by the action of central banks at a time when growth is very strong,” said Flavio Carpenzano, Investment Director, Capital One Group. “For years you were like a spoiled child, you could get all the money you wanted and for free and you could buy what you wanted, you didn’t care that much about quality. Now it’s the other way round, you have to be more disciplined so you need to look carefully at valuation.” The Ukraine crisis could threaten Europe’s recovery this year, cautions Walid Koudmani, market analyst at financial brokerage XTB: “Today’s Eurozone data showed a general improvement in GDP of the Member States for the fourth quarter 2021 with Spain (+2.0%) recording the highest increase compared to the previous quarter while declines were recorded in Austria (-2.2%) and Germany (-0.7%). While this is overall a positive report, the situation remains unclear as many factors could slow down or impact economic growth in the area, particularly with growing tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border and rising energy prices.” The energy crisis, and the cost of living squeeze, also weighed on the eurozone economy, points out Rachel Barton, Europe Strategy Lead for Accenture: “Following the rapid proliferation of the Omicron variant across the continent, the impact on eurozone recovery has been clear in the slowing of GDP growth. Ongoing supply chain disruption, the energy crisis and inflation have also intensified. Companies need to continue to shore up their operations against these headwinds as we move through 2022. That said, the recent lifting of Covid restrictions in many European countries should help to get economic and business growth back on track.” Although growth slowed last quarter, the eurozone economy handled the pandemic better than in early waves, says Bert Colijn, economist at ING. Growth could be ‘feeble’ in the first quarter of 2022, due to Omicron, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. But despite that, ING don’t expect growth to turn negative in Q1. Colijn explains: The current Covid impact has seen milder restrictions put in place and mobility data already suggests a smaller impact compared to last year. This GDP data confirms that. Of course, it still marks a slowdown compared to growth in the third quarter, but that was to be expected given the moderating rebound effects, supply chain problems and increased coronavirus infections. The fact that GDP still continued to grow is a sign of strength for the economy. But there were regional differences, he adds: Germany did not manage to grow in 4Q, confirming that the economy continues to trail the eurozone average on the back of being harder hit by supply chain problems than other countries given its high share of automotive production as a share of GDP. France on the other hand, did see growth surprise on the upside with 0.7% growth, mainly driven by catchup consumption in the service sector. Italy did better than expected with 0.6% growth, but Austria showed that economies are not yet immune to lockdowns either. It saw GDP shrink by -2.2% on the back of the harshest lockdown of the eurozone in the quarter. Austria’s economy contracted sharply in the last three months of 2021, after it imposed a lockdown to slow the pandemic. Austrian GDP shrank by 2.2% in July-September, down from 3.8% growth in Q3, which is the worst Q4 contraction recorded among EU countries so far. Austria imposed a full lockdown for three weeks in November and December, after a surge in Covid-19 cases. Those rules forced hospitality and leisure venues, and non-essential shops to close, while people were asked to work from home. It maintained restrictions for longer on unvaccinated citizens, who were told to remain at home for all but a handful of specific reasons, such as buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Austria’s Covid-19 cases fell to a two-month low by the end of December. So while the lockdown hit growth, it also appears to have suppressed the virus, allowing the economy to open up again. Growth across the eurozone slowed at the end of last year, as the winter wave of Covid-19 hampered the recovery, particularly in Germany. GDP across the euro area rose by 0.3% in the October-December quarter, much slower than the pacy 2.3% expansion recorded in July-September. The final quarter of the year saw restrictions imposed in some European countries, as the pandemic surged last autumn. This hit service sector companies, with the Omicron variant dealing another blow to sectors such as travel in December. Germany, the eurozone’s largest member, dragged eurozone growth back. German GDP contracted by 0.7% in the last quarter, as its economy suffered from a surge in virus cases and ongoing supply chain disruption which held back factories. Restrictions on unvaccinated citizens were introduced in December, and some Christmas markets were cancelled. France expanded by 0.7% in the last quarter, stronger than expected, and recorded its best annual growth since 1969. Spain recorded 2% growth, making it the fastest-growing eurozone member to report growth figures for Q4. And as covered earlier, Italy grew by 0.6% in Q4, while Portugal’s GDP rose 1.6%. Statistics body Eurostat also estimates that the eurozone, and the wider European Union, grew by 5.2% during 2021 as the region recovered from 2020’s steep recession. That’s almost as fast as the US, which grew 5.7% last year, its biggest increase since 1984. We don’t yet have UK GDP figures for Q4. Italy’s economy grew by 0.6% in the last quarter of the year, down from 2.6% in the previous three months. Statistics body Istat reports that industry and services both expanded, but there was a decrease of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Domestic demand increased, but net exports dragged on growth, Istat says. On a year-on-year basis, GDP was 6.4% higher than Q4 2020: Portugal has recorded its fastest annual growth in over 30 years, as it recovered from the pandemic. The Portuguese economy grew by 4.9% during 2021, the highest growth since 1990, following a historical decline of 8.4% in 2020. Statistics body INE explains: Domestic demand presented a significant positive contribution to the annual rate of change of GDP, after being markedly negative in 2020, with a recovery of private consumption and investment. The contribution of net external demand was significantly less negative in 2021, with exports and imports of goods and services growing significantly. But, growth did slow in the last quarter of 2021; GDP rose by 1.6% in October-December, down from 2.9% growth in July-September. Ryanair is well-placed to thrive as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell - even it it has to cut prices to fill planes in the next few months: “The latest trading update from Ryanair, covering the last three months of 2021, was always likely to show strong growth on a year-on-year basis given the comparative quarter saw some of the tightest Covid restrictions. “However, the numbers are not as good as they might have been had Omicron not intervened. With his typical tact Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary blamed ‘media hysteria’ about the new Covid variant for the impact on the business. “Ryanair, never usually known for its generosity to customers with O’Leary once suggesting people would have to spend a pound to spend a penny on the carrier’s planes, is being forced to offer discounted tickets in the near-term to fill its flights. “However, the longer-term picture for pricing could be more favourable for Ryanair given the capacity which has come out of the market and likely pent-up demand for foreign travel over the summer. “Ryanair’s model isn’t about great customer service in the traditional sense but about low fares and getting people where they want to go on time and that proposition has proved a winning one over the years. “Ryanair has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and this means it is very well placed for a full recovery in the aviation sector, with the means to invest in new routes and potentially even to swoop on ailing rivals. Notably, it has raised its 2026 annual passenger target today. “In the short term, Ryanair is making no secret of the risk of further Covid disruption to come, with investors at least able to have some confidence it can steer a flight path through any turbulence.” Adam Vettese, analyst at trading platform eToro, says the budget airline has made progress: “Ryanair’s third-quarter numbers demonstrate how far the airline sector has come since the start of the pandemic. “With revenue up 286% year-on-year, load factor at 84% and revenue some 331% higher than it was in Q3 last year, its recovery is fairly advanced. “However, as we have learnt over the past 18 months, the airline sector is perhaps more sensitive to shifts in Covid policy than most others. “Airlines suffered over Christmas due to the imposition of stricter measures to contain the Omicron variant, denying them of revenue during one of the busiest times of the year for travel. “A lot of investors are treating airlines such as Ryanair as a ‘reopening play’, which makes sense, but they should expect some share price turbulence until the sector is completely out of the woods.” Stephen Furlong and Ross Harvey of stockbrokers and wealth managers Davy point out that Ryanair is well-hedged against risks such as rising fuel prices: We see [today’s] Q3 statement as broadly a holding one before we enter the Easter/summer period. But it is important to remember that Ryanair’s cost position (both fuel with hedging and ex-fuel), network expansion, customer proposition, employee growth and obviously balance sheet/cash flows are poised for its next phase of growth. We continue to believe that these ‘low cost’ tenets will show favourably, if not dramatically, this summer. We maintain our forecasts, our ‘Outperform’ rating and €19 price target. Ryanair’s shares have dipped slightly this morning, down 0.3% at €16.50. Ryanair has warned of a “hugely uncertain” financial outlook, even as the budget airline geared up to run more flights this summer than before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The Irish-listed carrier made a loss of €96m (£80m) in the last three months of 2021, although that was a significant improvement over the €321m loss in the same period in 2020, when strict international travel restrictions were still in place. Revenues quadrupled compared with last year, it said in its third-quarter results update. Ryanair added that the first three months of 2022 will require “significant price stimulation at lower prices” to attract customers, which could hit profits. That uncertainty, plus the possibility of new restrictions if another variant of concern were to arise, meant the airline left unchanged its guidance for a loss in the year ending in March, at €250m to €450m – a wider than usual range. The airline blamed “media hysteria” over the Omicron variant for missing its target of 11 million passengers in December, instead carrying 9.5 million. The Omicron variant has proved to be more infectious than earlier dominant variants but widespread vaccines have meant that many governments, including in the UK, have started to loosen some of the stricter travel requirements. That has allowed Ryanair to plan for a summer bookings boom, with a schedule for 2022 that is 114% of 2019, the last year unaffected by the pandemic. More here... Inflation has slowed in Spain, but remains painfully high for households Spanish consumer prices rose by 6% year-on-year in January, statistics body INS reports. That’s a drop on the 30-year high of 6.5% set in December, but higher than forecast, and triple the European Central Bank’s target of 2%. Energy prices have been a key factor, as Bloomberg points out: Spain power prices have been surging since mid-June, having consistently broken new records, driven largely by natural gas prices. This has led to regulatory changes and tax breaks from the government for consumers. Vodafone is among the FTSE 100 top risers, up 3% this morning, after Europe’s largest activist fund took a stake in the telecoms giant. Cevian Capital is expected to push Vodafone to overhaul its business and restructure its portfolio, and take a more aggressive approach to consolidation in some markets, My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: The Swedish investment firm has built up holdings in Vodafone in recent months, according to sources quoted by Bloomberg, privately piling pressure on the firm to improve its performance. Shares in the British multinational have almost halved in value since 2018, with investor sentiment apparently declining through a series of acquisitions and sell-offs, amid belief that Vodafone overpaid for assets such as the German cable business it acquired in an €18bn deal that year. Cevian, which says it is a constructive investor in “overlooked, misunderstood or out-of-favour” firms, has gained prominence in the City after building up a 5% holding in the insurance firm Aviva, and has also owns a significant stake in education publisher Pearson, as well as Swedish telecoms business Ericsson. European stock markets have opened higher, with Germany’s DAX jumping 1% in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 20 points or 0.3%. It’s been a rocky month, though, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 3.6% (although the FTSE 100 has bucked the trend by gaining around 1.5%) Wall Street has been particularly hit by worries about interest rate rises, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7% in January (with one day to go), its worst month since March 2020. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says stocks are delicately poised: Investors are currently grappling with valuation metrics following a strong run over recent years for the main indices, with higher rates not only increasing borrowing costs for companies but also discounting the value of future profits. At the same time, the latest non-farm payrolls report at the end of the week is expected to show a weaker reading given the rise of the variant in December and a bout of adverse weather, with the current forecast being that around 150000 jobs will have been added. In the meantime, the main indices have reduced some of their losses in the year to date, although the Dow Jones remains down by 4.4%, the S&amp;P500 by 7% and the Nasdaq by 12%. Japan’s manufacturers ended 2021 on a low note. Japan’s factory output shrank by 1% in December, for the first time in three months, a larger fall than expected. It was pulled down by a decline in output of general-purpose and production machinery, such as chip-making equipment and engines used in manufacturing. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, suggests the global semiconductor shortages hit demand: Output especially fell among capital goods makers, probably due to the strong impact from the chip shortages. “It suggests its impact is widening even though the focus has been on the car industry.” A second survey of China’s factories released on Sunday also showed that coronavirus outbreaks and lockdowns in China took their toll on factories. A private index measuring activity at factories in China fell to 49.1 in January from December’s 50.9, the weakest since February 2020 in the first wave of the pandemic. That shows that the sector shrank this month, a gloomier view than the official PMI (see earlier post). The Caixin/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index found that companies saw drop in output and new orders during January, at a modest pace. New export business fell at the quickest pace since May 2020, and supply chain delays worsened. Firms also reported that inflationary pressures increased, with average input costs rising, and their own prices increasing. Dr. Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, says the ongoing pandemic hit China’s factory base: “The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.1 in January, down from 50.9 the previous month. The index slumped into negative territory for the fourth time since February 2020, with January’s reading being the lowest in 23 months. Over the past month, there were Covid-19 flare-ups in several regions in China, underscoring the downward pressure on the economy. Both supply and demand in the manufacturing sector weakened. Several regions tightened epidemic control measures following the resurgence, which impacted production and sales of manufactured goods. Both the subindexes for output and total new orders in January fell to their lowest since August. Overseas demand shrank at an even faster pace. The spread of the omicron variant of Covid-19 overseas dampened China’s external demand, with the gauge for new export orders in January being the lowest in 20 months. China’s factory growth slowed this month, as the latest wave of Covid-19 infections hits its economy. The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) dropped to 50.1 this month, showing a slowdown from December’s 50.3, data released this weekend shows. That’s only just above the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It suggests the Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in several Chinese provinces in recent months have disrupted factories and hit demand, ahead of the Lunar New Year. A subindex for production in January fell to 50.9, down from 51.4 in December, while a subindex for new orders came in at 49.3, down from 49.7 in December, showing orders fell at a faster rate. New export orders rose to 48.4 compared with 48.1 a month earlier, suggesting overseas demand remained subdued. China’s services sector also showed slower growth, pulling the wider composite PMI down to 51.0, from 52.2. Ryanair is also hoping it may be able to lift fares this summer, pointing out that its rivals have cut capacity in the pandemic. Reuters explains: Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters in an interview that the fact so many rivals were cutting capacity compared to pre-COVID levels meant “there absolutely could be upward pressure on fares.” He added that if Ryanair did need to cut fares to stimulate demand, its relatively large fuel hedging position means it is in a much better position than rivals to do so. Ryanair has kept expanding, ready to win market share as travel returns. Since April 2021 it has announced 15 new bases and 720 new routes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Budget airline Ryanair has struck a cautious note over the speed of the recovery in the travel sector this morning, after posting a net loss of €96m for the last three months. With Omicron hitting operations in recent weeks, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has warned that the outlook in the current quarter (its Q4) is “hugely uncertain”, despite a recent pick-up in demand. Demand has improved recently after travel restrictions were lifted, O’Leary says. But bookings are coming in later than usual, so the airline is planning price cuts this quarter to stimulate demand. Ryanair cut its capacity for January by a third in response to the latest variant which caused a “collapse in bookings” over the Christmas/New Year period. In December, traffic fell to 9.5m passengers, below its target of 11m. O’Leary warns that the outlook for this quarter (January-March) is very uncertain, saying: The outlook for pricing and yields for the remainder of FY22 is hugely uncertain. Ryanair is sticking to its target of carrying ‘just under’ 100m passengers this financial year. But due to Covid uncertainty its earnings guidance is wider than usual - with a net loss of between €250m and €450m expected. O’Leary adds there could be further Covid disruption ahead: This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us.” Europe’s stock markets are expected to open higher, after a turbulent January that’s seen the pan-European Stoxx 600 drop over 4%.

An accidental leader, he lacked drive and colour when placed beside his predecessors at the head of the party, Roy Jenkins and David Owen. In 1981 he was one of 28 Labour MPs who followed Jenkins, Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers in splitting from Labour and forming the SDP. Although not as newsworthy as “the Gang of Four”, Maclennan designed the structure of the new party, which, supposedly learning the lessons of Labour’s system, excluded the membership from making party policy. Following general elections in 1983 and 1987, when the SDP failed to gain more than a handful of MPs in either contest, a ballot of its members in 1987 agreed that the party should merge with the Liberals. Initially Maclennan was opposed to a merger, as was Owen, who resigned as leader in protest at the prospect. Other key SDP figures, including Rodgers, Jenkins and Williams, favoured a link up with the Liberals, but as they were no longer MPs there was no experienced person in the House of Commons to head the party in merger talks. They were therefore surprised and delighted when Maclennan made a U-turn and declared that he would now back the merger. As the new leader of the SDP he agreed the merger details with the Liberal party leader David Steel and also prepared, with the help of some young aides, what was widely regarded as a disastrous founding policy statement for the Lib Dems – a document so widely disparaged on all sides that it led, in part, to Steel’s resignation. With Paddy Ashdown voted in as the new Lib Dem leader in 1988, Maclennan became a frontbench spokesman for the new party and, eventually, their president from 1994-98. Maclennan was born in Glasgow into a medical family. His father, Sir Hector Maclennan, a gynaecologist, was president of the Royal College of Obstetricians, and his mother, Isabel (nee Adam), was a doctor. Educated at the Glasgow Academy, Maclennan then studied history and law at Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Columbia University in New York. Called to the bar at Gray’s Inn in 1962, he practised in London as an international lawyer. As a Labour party candidate in 1966 he won the remote Caithness and Sutherland seat from the Liberals with a majority of 64 votes. He held on to it over the next 35 years under three different party labels, Labour, SDP and Lib Dem, often canvassing in his tweed suit with a rolled-up umbrella and steadily increasing his majority by attracting a substantial personal vote. He tried to make his constituency a centre for the arts in Scotland and spoke up for nuclear power (Dounreay, the local nuclear plant, was the largest employer). As a Labour MP he was a “Jenkinsite”, a supporter of Jenkins; such MPs, often Oxbridge educated and recently elected, wanted to keep alive the flame of the late Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. Many distrusted Gaitskell’s successor, Harold Wilson, and Maclennan backed one of the first attempts to unseat Wilson in 1968. Along with like-minded MPs such as Rodgers, Williams, David Marquand, John Roper and Roy Hattersley, he also defied the party line in the early 1970s by supporting British accession to the EEC. He was a passionate supporter of the European Union until the end. Maclennan’s one experience in government was as a junior minister in the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, between 1974 and 1979. Given the government’s battle against high inflation, the department was often in the news. He worked well with his two secretaries of state, Williams and then Hattersley, but less so with trade union leaders; he found them abrasive and demanding. Maclennan felt that he deserved promotion, but it never came, and colleagues believed that he failed to make the most of the opportunities to advance himself. More impressive in private than in public, and blessed with intellectual confidence, he was diffident in manner and often hesitant on the platform. After his defection to the SDP and once the creation of the Liberal Democrats had gone through, Maclennan worked with Labour’s Robin Cook on a proposed programme of constitutional change for a future Labour government, perhaps in coalition with the Lib Dems. Labour’s landslide election victory in 1997 stymied hopes of a coalition, but Maclennan’s work helped to pave the way for an ambitious programme of reform carried out by Tony Blair’s government, which included devolution for Scotland and Wales, changes in the House of Lords and a freedom of information bill. In 2001, after deciding to relinquish his seat, he took a life peerage as Lord Maclennan of Rogart (his father had owned a hotel in Rogart, which was in his son’s constituency) and was Liberal Democrat spokesman on Europe, Scotland and Cabinet Office matters. Despite also serving as president of the Liberal Democrats in the late 90s, in private he thought that too often the party’s members went in for moralising and virtue signalling. Uneasy about the Cameron-Clegg coalition, he retained many of his Labour attachments but decided he was “too old to cross the floor again”. Friends and constituents saw his thoughtfulness and kindness in ways that were not always appreciated in the cut and thrust of Westminster or in the intrigues of internal party politics. A keen collector of art, he once wrote a libretto for an opera, and he also played the violin. In 1968 he married Helen Noyes (nee Cutter), an American teacher. She survives him, as do his children, Adam and Ruth, and a stepson, Nicholas. • Robert Adam Ross Maclennan, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, politician, born 26 June 1936; died 18 January 2020 • This article was amended on 20 January 2020 to clarify that Maclennan studied history at Balliol College before he studied law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/aug/09/angus-taylor-will-not-rule-out-taxpayers-paying-to-replace-or-extend-liddell-coal-plants-life","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-08T23:36:15Z","webTitle":"Angus Taylor will not rule out taxpayers paying to replace or extend Liddell coal plant’s life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/09/angus-taylor-will-not-rule-out-taxpayers-paying-to-replace-or-extend-liddell-coal-plants-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/aug/09/angus-taylor-will-not-rule-out-taxpayers-paying-to-replace-or-extend-liddell-coal-plants-life","fields":{"headline":"Angus Taylor will not rule out taxpayers paying to replace or extend Liddell coal plant’s life","bodyText":"Angus Taylor has announced a taskforce to study the expected closure of the Liddell power station, leaving all options on the table including extending the life of or replacing the ageing coal plant at taxpayer expense. The energy and “emissions reduction” minister who has presided over steadily increasing greenhouse gas emissions announced the review on Friday, a week after AGL revealed it would extend the life of Liddell from 2022 to April 2023. Taylor told ABC News Breakfast the taskforce was made possible by the “very collaborative” approach of the New South Wales government. It would consider “everything from extension to replacement with like-for-like capacity”, arguing Australia did not want a repeat of power price rises and blackouts after the Hazelwood coal station in Victoria was decommissioned. Asked if this could include taxpayer funding, Taylor at first said “no” before qualifying that “all options are on the table” and repeatedly refusing to rule it out. “We’ve got to have all options on the table and I’m not going to front-run the conclusion of this taskforce,” he said. “What matters is we get a solution as quickly as possible. We’ve got four years to put the answer into place.” Asked about whether renewables could provide baseload power, Taylor said “storage is expensive” and argued that “gas is very, very important in this mix”, calling on states including Victoria to lift moratoriums on exploration and fracking. After the Morrison government was re-elected in May, the Coalition set up an inquiry into nuclear power after calls from several backbenchers to consider the controversial means to provide baseload power. The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, weighed into the debate on Tuesday saying renewables combined with storage was “the cheapest form of new generation … cheaper than new coal and far cheaper than nuclear”. Turnbull’s energy minister in the 45th parliament, Josh Frydenberg, failed to persuade AGL to keep Liddell open, leading to a chorus of outrage from Coalition MPs including Craig Kelly who called for options including nationalising the plant and the government building coal-fired power plants. The coal baron Trevor St Baker has signalled an interest in redeveloping Liddell but claims he has not sought taxpayer support for the idea. In March Taylor confirmed the Morrison government was continuing to assess new coal power projects as part of its underwriting scheme to fund new power generation despite pushback from moderate Liberals. Last week the NSW energy and environment minister, Matt Kean, said he was “pleased to see AGL doing the right thing by the people of NSW by delaying the closure” of the plant. Kean said he was focused on long-term solutions to introduce new electricity supply into the market and called on companies to “deliver more dispatchable generation that drives down prices and ensures reliability into the future”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/oct/10/welsh-government-refuses-to-halt-nuclear-mud-dumping","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-10T18:41:17Z","webTitle":"Welsh government refuses to halt 'nuclear mud' dumping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/10/welsh-government-refuses-to-halt-nuclear-mud-dumping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/oct/10/welsh-government-refuses-to-halt-nuclear-mud-dumping","fields":{"headline":"Welsh government refuses to halt 'nuclear mud' dumping","bodyText":"The Labour-led Welsh government has been heavily criticised after refusing to halt the dumping of “nuclear mud” from a power station project in the sea off Cardiff. It insisted that the debris from the Hinkley Point C construction site in Somerset was safe and argued that it would be breaking the law if it suspended the disposal licence. During a fierce debate at the assembly in Cardiff Bay, close to where the mud is being dumped, the Welsh cabinet secretary for energy, Lesley Griffiths, dismissed as “scaremongering” claims highlighted by the campaigners that the Hinkley Point sludge could have been contaminated by weapons-grade plutonium in the 1960s. She said: “Points have also been raised about historic issues with cooling ponds and the production of weapons-grade plutonium. This has understandably caused concern, but the test results on this marine licence show the dredged material is within safe limits and poses no radiological risk to human health or the environment and is safe to be disposed of at sea.” Griffiths also expressed concern that campaigners had threatened to organise a “people’s flotilla” to block the vessels bringing in the mud. “I was alarmed by the call to blockade these works. This is dangerous and risks public safety,” she said. “I urge members to support science, not scaremongering.” There has been growing concern and anger that 320,000 tonnes of sediment from the Hinkley Point C site is being disposed of at the Cardiff Grounds sandbank. Campaigners claim that the mud has not been tested properly and could contain particles that pose a health risk. They have described the sediment as “nuclear mud” and nicknamed the sea off Cardiff “Geiger Bay”, a play on Tiger Bay, the old slang name for the city’s docklands. One of their main concerns is that the sediment could be washed ashore in a storm. Scientists, surfers and a pop star, Cian Ciarán, the keyboard player from Super Furry Animals, are among those who have been involved in protests and legal action against the dumping. Some have claimed that Wales’s famous beaches, such as Rhossili on the Gower peninsula, could be affected. Before the debate, scores of people protested outside the Welsh assembly’s Senedd building, chanting: “We don’t want your mud.” During the debate, the independent assembly member Neil McEvoy said the Welsh government had “welcomed” the mud without making sure it was safe. He claimed the new information about the alleged cooling pond accidents with weapons-grade plutonium had been ignored by an “incompetent and arrogant” government. McEvoy added: “The UK and Chinese governments struck a deal worth tens of billions of pounds, and as part of their deal, they plan to dump 320,000 tonnes of mud from a nuclear power station off the coast of Wales without testing it properly.” Some Welsh Labour members also expressed concern. Mike Hedges, who represents Swansea East, said he had asked the energy company building Hinkley Point C, EDF, three times if they would provide samples of mud that could be tested again by academics, but had been ignored. An EDF source rejected this. Outside the chamber, the shadow energy secretary, Andrew RT Davies, said it was a sad day for Welsh democracy. “The debate on nuclear mud dumping shows how shockingly out of touch the Welsh Labour government is with the concerns of the general public. Welsh Labour government ministers have the power to intervene and stop the mud dumping – but instead have scandalously turned their backs,” he said. EDF insists that the mud is safe. A spokesperson said: “EDF did everything that it was requested to do when it applied for a licence to dredge and deposit mud in the Severn estuary. The mud is no different to mud found anywhere else up and down the coast and it has been thoroughly tested by independent experts, who confirmed it poses no threat to human health or the environment.” Asked about the cooling pond and weapons-grade plutonium claims, a spokesperson for Magnox, the nuclear management and operations contractor, said: “The discharges from Hinkley Point A are a matter of public record, and have never exceeded the authorised limits. The type of event referred to was not classed as an accident and therefore not recorded as such. Such events occurred very infrequently and we had recovery operations in place to minimise any environmental impact.” • This article was corrected on 11 October 2018.

Last Saturday morning, a gunman entered a Walmart store in the border city of El Paso, Texas, and shot dozens of people, killing at least 22. Hours later, another killer wearing body armour and carrying 100-bullet magazines shot nine people in Dayton, Ohio, and would have killed dozens more if he had not been shot by police within a minute. There have been more mass shootings in America this year than there have been days – and everyone knows what happens next: condemnation from Republican politicians before they proceed to block any significant gun controls. But the shooting in El Paso has opened up another debate. A racist manifesto that appeared to be linked to the El Paso shooting seemed to make it clear that racist violence by white terrorists has become a global problem – from Utøya, Norway, to Christchurch, New Zealand, and now Texas. This week’s cover stories look at Donald Trump’s predictably flimsy response to the white nationalist violence that has been fomented under his presidency and investigate the rise of a global network of white supremacist terror. In Turkey, civic elections in Istanbul have proved a focal point of resistance to president Erdoğan. Could Moscow’s local elections prove a turning point in Russian politics? That’s the hope of anti-Putin figures such as Alexei Navalny and Lyubov Sobol.

In late July protests about access to the election boiled over with the largest number of protest arrests in recent history. Shaun Walker, who spent a decade reporting on Russia, reports from Moscow and wonders if the country is looking to a post-Putin future. Elsewhere in from Russia, Andrew Roth reports on somewhat terrifying plans to build a floating nuclear power station in the Arctic – a vision that Greenpeace has already dubbed “Chernobyl on ice”.

In comments echoed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president demanded continued regulatory harmonisation as the price for protecting the flow of trade, a demand that will be a cause of concern for the Conservative government. Macron, who noted in an aside that his country would soon be the only nuclear power in the EU, told reporters: “If Boris Johnson wants a very ambitious trade deal, there has to be very ambitious regulatory convergence”, adding in English: “Be my guest.” “We do not want them to be an unfair competitor,” Macron said. “My message to the UK is that the more loyal we are vis-a-vis each other, the closer relationship we can have. “If the British prime minister and the British parliament want an ambitious trade deal, they know where the European standards are … The more they are attracted to reducing standards – on climate, social standards or anything else – the more they walk away from the European market, the more they will be away from us. The more ambitious the trade deal, the more we need regulatory harmonisation.” The intervention from Macron came as the new commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned that the post-Brexit negotiations on the future relationship would drag on beyond 2020. Johnson has said he will not extend the 11-month transition period, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union, but that this provides “ample” time for a comprehensive deal on the future relationship to be finalised. Von der Leyen appeared to directly contradict the prime minister by warning that certain parts of the deal would need to be prioritised, including trade in goods, fisheries and security cooperation, but that others, potentially including the arrangements for the financial services sector, would be left for later. “We will have to prioritise,” Von der Leyen said at the end of a two-day leaders’ summit in Brussels. “We will put specific focus on those issues that were an economic cliff edge at the end of 2020 if they would not be done. Why is that? These are issues where we have neither a framework to fall back on nor the possibility to take unilateral contingency measures covering the period after 1 January 2021.” Von der Leyen described the plan as a matter of “sequencing” adding that “there will be more emphasis on a certain ranking”. The size of Johnson’s majority has been welcomed in Brussels, where the 27 heads of state and government have gathered for a two-day summit. Charles Michel, the European council president, said he expected the withdrawal agreement to be passed through parliament within weeks to allow the UK to leave on 31 January. “We expect as soon as possible a vote by the British parliament on the withdrawal agreement,” Michel said. EU leaders believe the Conservative majority will give Johnson free rein to decide his negotiating objectives and compromise in the talks where necessary. EU leaders are now waiting to see what incarnation of the prime minister will emerge now he is secure in Downing Street. Johnson had initially approached the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement with bullish, uncompromising talk, but swiftly broke his red lines to concede to a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, hinted at private assurances from Johnson that he would sign up to EU standards in order to secure a trade deal. “I’d like that to ensure we still have tariff-free and quota-free trade between Britain and the EU and to have a set of minimum standards so that nobody feels that there’s unfair competition or anyone’s trying to undercut them when it comes to labour rights, environmental protection and issues like that,” he said. “And [from] my conversations with Mr Johnson, I think he’s probably in a similar space, so it’s a case of now getting on with it. “It’s a case of now getting on with it and I think the prospect is there to develop a new future economic partnership between the EU and UK, and one that’s going to be mighty and good for all of us.” There is a debate among the EU27 and with the European commission on what might be possible to negotiate between 31 January, when the UK is expected to leave, and the end of the transition period 11 months later. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, conceded at the summit that it would be “quite a challenge given the short time available” to find agreement even on trade by the end of next year. “We have to discuss the precise approach to these negotiations,” he said. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said her government would be pushing hard to maintain access to UK waters for Denmark’s fishing industry. “There is no doubt that fishing really matters,” she said. Satisfaction that there will now be clarity from the UK over the next steps has, however, been tempered by sadness at the its imminent departure. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said: “It is obviously a giant success for Boris Johnson. He is a charismatic leader. He won and now they will leave, unfortunately. That is bad news for Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2020/mar/05/bridgend-braces-fallout-ford-factory-closure-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-05T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"'It's scary': Bridgend braces for fallout from Ford factory closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/bridgend-braces-fallout-ford-factory-closure-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2020/mar/05/bridgend-braces-fallout-ford-factory-closure-wales","fields":{"headline":"'It's scary': Bridgend braces for fallout from Ford factory closure","bodyText":"In May, Ford will clock up 40 years of making car engines in Bridgend, south Wales. But the anniversary will pass without any celebration. Just months later, by 25 September, the production lines will come to a halt for the final time. About 1,700 people were working at the 60-acre site halfway between Cardiff and Swansea when the closure was announced in June 2019, with Ford blaming “changing customer demand and cost”. Dick Jenkins, a 47-year-old electrician, has clocked in and out of the plant for three decades, the only workplace he has ever known, since he joined a few days after his 17th birthday. “I have never filled out a CV until now because I never had to. It’s scary. I know I’m not alone, but whatever happens next will only be the second job I have ever had.” The community is braced for the loss of some of the region’s best-paid manufacturing jobs. The average Ford salary is £41,000, according to the GMB trade union, and the carmaker has spent a significant sum of money to close the factory. A source described the redundancy and pension payouts for workers as the most generous they had ever seen. Local businesses fear the impact on the town nonetheless. Craig Williams, 34, runs Capelli Salons at the bottom of the town’s main shopping street, where takeaway restaurants and a row of barber shops sit alongside vacant premises. On a wet weekday afternoon, behind the hairdresser’s steamed-up windows, a couple of clients are being shampooed and blowdried. When the Ford closure was first announced “there was almost mass panic”, and a few regular customers stopped coming. “If their husbands or whoever worked there, we are going to lose custom. It’s a luxury to have hair and beauty done, you’ve got a priority to pay your mortgage,” said Williams. Ford is the town’s largest employer and its biggest business rates payer. Property consultancy Altus Group calculates the plant paid £1.6m in rates in 2019-20, far more than any other company in the town. Business rates, which are paid as a proportion of the value of the property owned by a company, are pooled in Wales between councils, and distributed centrally, meaning the effect of the shortfall will also be felt further afield. Six villages or estates in the Bridgend local authority area are among the nation’s 10% most deprived, according to the most recent Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation. One is Bettws, a former mining village in Ogmore valley, where a colourful mural on the community centre wall recalls its industrial heyday. In the 1970s, when the region began to lose mining and heavy industry, Wales enjoyed some success attracting foreign investment, often to Bridgend, with its proximity to the M4 motorway. However many locals can reel off a list of the big foreign firms that have come and gone: Sony, LG, Bosch – and concerns remain about the long-term future of Tata Steel in Port Talbot. The Ford workers and the Welsh government hope new arrivals will help to fill the hole left by Ford. The chemicals firm Ineos will assemble its Land Rover Defender-inspired 4x4 at a plant being built next to the Ford factory. But the first car will not roll off the line until 2021, and Ineos is initially hiring only 200 staff. Jenkins has sent his CV and is awaiting a response. Other Ford workers are looking to Aston Martin Lagonda, which will start building its first SUV at St Athan, 10 miles from Bridgend, in the summer. However both of those companies combined will employ only a fraction of the Ford workforce. The Welsh government has responsibility for economic development among its devolved powers over health, education, transport and planning. A block grant received from the UK government accounts for the majority of Cardiff’s £20bn annual budget. Many in Wales feel overlooked by Westminster, and believe they are at the back of the queue after the English regions and other UK nations. “Wales is only equivalent to 5% of the English population, it gets forgotten about,” says Victoria Winckler, the director of the Welsh thinktank the Bevan Foundation. “The UK government must not wash its hands of places in Wales.” Infrastructure is not a devolved power, an issue that rankles locally, especially since the former transport secretary Chris Grayling in 2018 scrapped plans to electrify the rail line beyond Cardiff. The £106bn for the HS2 high-speed line connecting London with Birmingham and the north of England was “another reminder of the gross inequality,” said Huw David, a Labour councillor and leader of Bridgend county borough council. “We are still waiting for them to electrify the railway between the capital and Swansea, the second city, never mind high-speed.” Local Carwyn Jones was first minister of Wales until 2018, and the Labour politician is in his final term as Welsh assembly member for Bridgend. He believes Westminster has “let Wales down sorely” over infrastructure and energy strategy, chiefly the scrapped £1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project and the cancelled £16bn nuclear power station on Anglesey. Bridgend went blue for the first time in 32 years in the election, making the serial entrepreneur Jamie Wallis only the constituency’s second Conservative MP since its creation in 1983, with a majority of just over 1,000. His office did not respond to requests for comment. One in six workers in Bridgend are employed in manufacturing, according to the TUC, double the UK figure. Future economic success means securing high-tech, quality jobs, says Jones. “We’re not going to compete with low-cost economies even if we try. We want to attract jobs into Bridgend and elsewhere on the basis that we have a skilled workforce and a pipeline of training,” he said. Spectrum Technologies offers those kind of jobs, if a limited number, with a 58-member workforce that makes laser-marking equipment for aircraft wires and cables. The chief executive, Peter Dickinson, plans to take on a handful of new employees in the next year, but has historically found it hard to recruit engineers from the company’s doorstep. Lamenting the local rail, road and air infrastructure, Dickinson says if he was choosing where to locate the company now, he would not pick Bridgend, “unless and until there is a levelling up and the government addresses the issues that impact both the region and us as a company”.

Among them was Hinkley Point in Somerset, one of the eight proposed sites for new nuclear power stations around the coasts. That was before the increasing volume of melting of the Greenland ice cap was properly understood and when most experts thought there was no net melting in the Antarctic. Satellite measurements released earlier this month and other recent observations of how warmer seas are eroding ice shelves and glaciers have removed uncertainty. Estimates of sea level rise in the next 50 years have gone up from less than 30cm to more than a metre, well within the lifespan of the nuclear stations the UK government has planned. The extra coastal erosion and threat of storm surges that this increase in sea level will bring to our shores might make sensible people think twice about siting any buildings in vulnerable places, let alone nuclear power stations. So far, however, the government has yet to respond and is pressing ahead with its plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2020/jan/16/lord-chalfont-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-16T15:04:15Z","webTitle":"Lord Chalfont obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/lord-chalfont-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2020/jan/16/lord-chalfont-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Lord Chalfont obituary","bodyText":"The former Labour defence minister Lord Chalfont, who has died aged 100, had perhaps the most precipitous and unlikely rise to a political career in modern history. He was Alun Gwynne Jones, defence correspondent of the Times, at the time of the election of Harold Wilson’s first Labour government in October 1964, and in a matter of days was summoned for an unexpected briefing with the prime minister at No 10, leaving a short time later as both a minister – for disarmament, based in the Foreign Office, not the Ministry of Defence – and a life peer. “If the word had been invented I would have said I was gobsmacked,” Chalfont told the Independent in 1995. “I have never expressed any political views that could characterise me as left or right.” In that, over time, he advised all three main parties on defence issues, he was correct. Many, however, would query that assessment, as he later took increasingly authoritarian stands in support of the Thatcher government, which led to her recommending his appointment in 1989 as deputy chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and in 1990 as chairman of the Radio Authority. In 1964, since he had never been a member of the Labour party (or indeed any political party), running him in a byelection for the Commons was regarded as too risky, especially as Wilson’s majority was only four. When he pointed out to the prime minister that he was not necessarily a Labour supporter, Wilson imperturbably replied: “Such ideological commitment if conscientiously pursued would mark you as unique in my administration.” It was an astonishing career development for Gwynne Jones, born in Monmouth, south Wales, to Arthur, an electrician, and Liza (nee Hardman), a teacher. Educated at West Monmouth school in Pontypool, he was commissioned in the South Wales Borderers in 1940 and served with the regiment for 21 years. Chalfont won the Military Cross in a hand-to-hand firefight with communist guerrillas in Malaysia in 1957, shooting an attacker at a range of two yards and disabling his grenade before it could explode. He became an intelligence officer and fluent Russian speaker during the cold war, retiring in 1961 when passed over for command of his regiment, to become the Times’s defence correspondent. On his appointment as a minister, his editor, William Haley, told him he would have much less influence on government policy than he had working for the paper. This may have been correct: Chalfont diligently pursued Labour’s nuclear disarmament strategy, seeking to redirect resources to conventional arms, but the British proposals were eventually undermined by the Americans. An ancillary task was to prevent the frequently inebriated foreign secretary George Brown from embarrassing the government; Chalfont was the source of the famous story of Brown requesting a dance from a scarlet-clad figure at a reception who turned out to be a cardinal. In 1967 Chalfont was placed in charge of Britain’s negotiations to join the European Common Market, during which he inadvertently caused a diplomatic incident by advising journalists that Britain might seek a free-trade deal with the US if rejected again and would consider removing troops from the defence of Germany. His offer to resign was refused by Wilson, De Gaulle vetoed the British application and troops stayed on the Rhine. After the government’s defeat in 1970, Chalfont veered away from frontline politics, becoming a commentator – including, for a period, for the Guardian and New Statesman – a regular broadcaster and an author of eight books, mainly on military subjects, including a 1976 biography of Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. His memoir, The Shadow of My Hand, was published in 2000. He spent increasing time on directorships in the City, including Lazard merchant bank, IBM, Shandwick public relations and the VSEL shipbuilding consortium until its takeover by BAE in 1995. Not all of these ventures ended happily: within six months of his being taken on to the board of Spey Finance, a property company, in 1974, it crashed, leaving him to rue City morality: “an insight not only into what could happen but into the dubious methods of a lot of people”. There was also an increasing obsession with supposed communist infiltration that led to his association with various rightwing pressure groups including Freedom in Sport – championing the right of cricketers to play in apartheid South Africa and of the South African athlete Zola Budd to run for Britain in the Olympics – the Institute for the Study of Terrorism, the UK Committee for a Free World and the European Atlantic Group. There was also the Media Monitoring Group, primarily focused on alleged leftwing bias at the BBC; the corporation, Chalfont announced in 1987, employed “communists, militants and leftwing agitators of all persuasions”. The previous year he had said: “What we need is not less secrecy but a great deal more,” adding that the government had “a duty to be as draconian and severe as it thinks fit”. Such attitudes led Thatcher to support his appointment to the oversight bodies for broadcasters, which came to a rapid end when it became clear that Shandwick and the security firm Hamilton Ingram, with which he was associated, were advising ITV companies on how to secure their franchises. These and Chalfont’s links to Zeus Security Consultants and Securipol had been denounced in the Commons, to Tory jeers, by the Lib Dem leader, Paddy Ashdown. Zeus had been engaged in the investigation and surveillance of anti-nuclear objectors to the Sizewell B nuclear power station inquiry. Chalfont’s last campaign sought the exoneration of two RAF pilots whose helicopter crashed with the loss of 29 lives, mostly senior intelligence personnel, on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. The pilots were initially blamed by the RAF, but cleared in 2011. Chalfont had a brief wartime marriage, then in 1948 married Mona Mitchell, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. She died in 2008 and their daughter also predeceased him. • Alun Arthur Gwynne Jones, Lord Chalfont, politician and journalist, born 5 December 1919; died 10 January 2020"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jul/17/us-voters-whats-your-reaction-to-trump-and-putins-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-17T12:30:07Z","webTitle":"US voters: what's your reaction to Trump and Putin's meeting?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/17/us-voters-whats-your-reaction-to-trump-and-putins-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jul/17/us-voters-whats-your-reaction-to-trump-and-putins-meeting","fields":{"headline":"US voters: what's your reaction to Trump and Putin's meeting?","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s meeting on Tuesday with Russian president, Vladimir Putin and his failure to condemn Russian meddling in the US election has drawn strong criticism from within the Republican party.

But other Republicans defended the US president.

The renewables record was set in the third quarter of this year after its share of the electricity mix rose to 40%. It is the first time that electricity from British windfarms, solar panels and renewable biomass plants has surpassed fossil fuels since the UK’s first power plant fired up in 1882. The new milestone confirms predictions made by National Grid that 2019 will be the first year since the Industrial Revolution that zero-carbon electricity – renewables and nuclear – overtakes gas and coal-fired power. A string of new offshore windfarms built this year helped nudge renewables past fossil fuels, which made up 39% of UK electricity, in a crucial tipping point in Britain’s energy transition. Fossil fuels made up four-fifths of the country’s electricity fewer than 10 years ago, split between gas and coal, but the latest analysis by Carbon Brief shows that coal-fired power was less than 1% of all electricity generated. British coal plants are shutting down ahead of a 2025 ban. By next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Gas-fired power makes up the bulk of the dwindling share of fossil fuels in the energy system at 38%. Nuclear power provided slightly less than a fifth of the UK’s electricity in the last quarter, the report said. Wind power is the UK’s strongest source of renewable energy and made up 20% of the UK’s electricity following a series of major windfarm openings in recent years. Electricity from renewable biomass plants made up 12% of the energy system, while solar panels contributed 6%. The world’s largest offshore windfarm, the Hornsea One project, began generating electricity off the Yorkshire coast in February, reaching a peak capacity of 1,200MW in October. It followed the opening of the Beatrice windfarm off the north-east coast of Scotland over the summer. Together these schemes almost doubled the 2,100MW worth of offshore capacity which began powering homes in 2018. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the renewables record is “yet another milestone on our path towards ending our contribution to climate change altogether by 2050”. He said: “Already, we’ve cut emissions by 40% while growing the economy by two thirds since 1990. Now, with more offshore wind projects on the way at record low prices we plan to go even further and faster in the years to come.” Luke Clark, of Renewable UK, said the industry hopes to treble the size of its offshore wind sector by 2030 to generate more than a third of the UK’s electricity. Under the Labour party’s plans for Green Industrial Revolution the offshore wind industry would grow five-fold in a decade, with the addition of an extra 37 giant offshore windfarms and 70,000 new jobs. According to Renewable UK, the growth of the renewables industry is good news for energy bills, as well as the environment, due to the steep fall in the cost of wind and solar power technologies over recent years. “The cost of new offshore wind projects, for example, has just fallen to an all-time low, making onshore and offshore wind our lowest-cost large scale power sources,” Clark said. The next generation of offshore windfarms is expected to cost about £40 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, less than the average market price for electricity on the wholesale energy markets. “If government were to back a range of technologies – like onshore wind and marine renewables – in the same way as it is backing offshore wind, consumers and businesses would be able to fully reap the benefits of the transition to a low carbon economy,” Clark said. • This article was amended on 14 October 2019 because an earlier version said the Hornsea One project was off the Norfolk coast, when the Yorkshire coast was meant.

A temporary closure of two of the country’s eight nuclear plants resulted in a double-digit drop in nuclear generation in January, compared to the same period last year. Prospects for new nuclear projects have commanded headlines and government attention in recent weeks, with Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping their plans for major new plants. But the fate of the existing plants, which usually provide about a fifth of the UK’s electricity supplies, has been pulled into focus by outages due to safety checks and engineering works running over schedule. Nuclear outages also push up carbon emissions because any capacity shortfall will typically be replaced by fossil fuel power stations. Seven of the nuclear power stations use an advanced gas reactor (AGR) design, the oldest of which is 43 years old and the youngest 30 years. Most were built with a lifetime of about 35 years in mind. All are due to be closed in the 2020s after owner EDF Energy extended their lives, but there are now fears that ageing infrastructure may reduce their output or even lead them to shut early. Iain Staffell, lecturer in sustainable energy at Imperial College, which compiled the nuclear output data, said: “Just as Toshiba and Hitachi have pulled out of building new reactors, we have one third of the existing nuclear capacity unavailable either for maintenance or because their maximum power has been reduced as they get older. “Many of our reactors were built in the late 70s, and like your typical 40-year-old they aren’t in peak physical condition any more.” Hunterston B on the west coast of Scotland is temporarily offline after inspections revealed more cracks than expected in the reactor’s graphite cores. The graphite bricks slow down the neutrons in a nuclear reaction, but over years the process changes the graphite’s structure. Reactor 3 at Hunterston has been offline for nearly a year since it powered down in March last year. EDF Energy told The Guardian last May it was “very confident” the reactor would come back online by last November, but the latest estimate is 30 April. The power station’s other reactor is due back on 31 March. However, the company will only be able to restart the plant if the nuclear regulator gives the green light for the safety case presented by EDF. The company also announced this week that it was pushing back the reopening of its Dungeness plant in Kent, due to maintenance related to pipes carrying steam from its boiler. Rather than restarting in late February, Dungeness should now come back in April. Martin Freer, head of nuclear physics at the University of Birmingham and director of the Birmingham Energy Institute, said: “It is clear they are showing their age. When they were originally built they weren’t built to operate as long as they will.” The issue is not one of safety because of tight regulation of the plants, he said, but it showed the UK’s need to get on and build new nuclear power stations. By the time Dungeness is hoped to return, another old plant, Hinkley B in Somerset, will have been taken offline for graphite inspections. Any unexpected rate of cracking found there could lead to a longer outage. Francis Livens, director at the University of Manchester’s Dalton Institute, said the struggle to green-light new nuclear projects had made the need to keep the old ones on more acute. Freer said he hoped the plants would make it to their planned closure dates rather than retiring early – Hunterston is officially meant to last until 2023 – but feared some would not. “It may just be a run of unfortunate incidents, or it might be a trend of reducing reliability,” he said. “My suspicion is not all of them will make it through to the end.” EDF said its investments meant the old plants were performing well and it had spent more than £100m over the past six years on the issue of graphite cracking. The company’s figures show generation from the company’s eight plants, including the newer one at Sizewell, growing after it bought them in 2008 before peaking in 2016 and declining since. Brian Cowell, managing director of generation, said: “EDF Energy’s seven advanced gas-cooled and one pressurised water nuclear power stations [Sizewell B] are delivering at ever better levels thanks to sustained investment and the expertise accumulated over more than 40 years of operation.” Several of the old plants are also undergoing safety reviews by the Office for Nuclear Regulation. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool both had a periodic safety review in January, with Heysham 2 and Torness to follow next January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2019/dec/12/detectors-jammers-and-cyber-attackers-the-rise-of-anti-drone-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-12T12:10:46Z","webTitle":"Detectors, jammers and cyber-attackers: the rise of anti-drone tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/12/detectors-jammers-and-cyber-attackers-the-rise-of-anti-drone-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2019/dec/12/detectors-jammers-and-cyber-attackers-the-rise-of-anti-drone-tech","fields":{"headline":"Detectors, jammers and cyber-attackers: the rise of anti-drone tech","bodyText":"One of the first drone deliveries was operated not by a tech giant from Silicon Valley but by small-time criminals who saw potential in the new technology. In late 2013, days before Amazon announced its futuristic plan to operate a fleet of automated vehicles, four people were arrested for attempting to smuggle contraband into a Georgia state prison using a drone. Guards had noticed a remote-controlled helicopter hovering above Calhoun prison. Later, they found the six-rotor drone in a nearby car alongside what appeared to be its cargo: pouches of tobacco and mobile phones. Five years later, Amazon still hasn’t launched its sky delivery service, while the proliferation of cheap, commercially available drones worldwide has far outpaced the ability of authorities to control them. In the past two years, non-military drones have shut down Gatwick airport for 36 hours, been used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuela’s president and even been flown by Isis fighters to drop grenades on their enemies. Responding to the threat, a host of companies – from state-run defence contractors to startups – have developed products that can detect, track, jam, destroy or even commandeer rogue drones. These services comprise a market that is expected to grow by between 20% and 30% in the next few years and could be worth £4bn by the middle of the next decade. “It’s a very, very big issue,” said Alex Riahi, who works for Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Israel’s major aerospace and defence manufacturer. In September IAI released its Popstar system, which can detect and track drones up to 4km away in day or night. IAI sells drone defence to foreign governments to place along their borders or around sensitive sites such as army bases or power plants to avoid spying or air attacks, and also provides equipment to shoot down military drones. But it is increasingly finding interest from other clients – airports, for example – who want to protect against shop-bought drones. Although coy about pricing, Riahi said the cost of these systems was less than the expense to a major airport of shutting down for an hour. Israel, with its history of drone warfare, has become a key producer of anti-drone products, especially as members of the military intelligence services often transfer their knowledge to start hi-tech companies after they leave the army. The booming industry has also sprung up in the US, Europe and China. A host of smaller firms are entering the market. Vorpal, another Israeli company, has compiled a database of signals emitted by 95% of drones that are available to buy, giving its clients the ability to detect most drones buzzing overhead. “There is no civil technology today that gives you 100%, bulletproof, all-cases, all-drone-types solution,” said Avner Turniansky, Vorpal’s vice-president of strategy. His VigilAir product has been tailored to work in dense urban environments where high buildings and radio “noise” often hide drone signals. During this year’s Eurovision song contest held in Tel Aviv, Israeli police bought his system and caught more than 20 people who were operating drones in no-fly zones over venues. Authorities wanted to clear the air to prevent any potential attacks, but also to make sure drones did not accidentally fall over large crowds. Turniansky said none of the perpetrators had apparent nefarious aims and in most cases they were completely clueless that they were flying illegally. Drones often have internal safeguards such as software that prevents them from flying over sensitive sites, meaning the drone will stop in midair as if it has hit a virtual wall. But Turniansky said at least one confiscated drone at Eurovision had been tampered with to block its GPS, allowing it to fly freely. Once detected, drones can be taken control of with a remote cyber-attack or, more straightforwardly, shot out the air with net guns. Radiofrequency jammers are also used, although not in airports where they could affect safety systems. “In an airport, nobody wants to jam,” Turniansky said. He said Vorpal’s system not only tracks drones but also allows users to locate the people flying them. This information is often more crucial than the location of the drone, as taking down one drone disrupting an airport is useless if the operator has more to hand. “In such cases, the ability to tell you where the operator is very valuable,” Turniansky said. Nimo Shkedy is also Israeli but his drone defence company, ApolloShield, is headquartered in New York. He sells counter-drone technology, including jamming “guns” that block drones with radio waves. In the US, these types of systems can only be sold to government agencies or with official authorisation, but the list of potential clients is growing. “We started with stadiums and public events,” said Shkedy. “But now this technology and these requirements are all over the place – airports, VIPs, prisons, borders, power plants, oil refineries, nuclear power plants, seaports, yachts,” he said. Shkedy and his business partner started the firm in 2016 after hearing that the Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli had unsuccessfully attempted to shut down the airspace above her wedding to prevent paparazzi from using drones. If she and her billionaire fiancé, Adi Ezra, had anti-drone products, they could have blocked off their area themselves. “We realised it was a big problem and it’s on the rise,” Shkedy said. “And it’s been on the rise ever since.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/oct/07/russia-nord-stream-2-gas-energy-uk-house-prices-markets-ftse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-07T15:51:38Z","webTitle":"Petrol retailers say recovery from fuel crisis is too slow; inflation warnings rise – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/oct/07/russia-nord-stream-2-gas-energy-uk-house-prices-markets-ftse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/oct/07/russia-nord-stream-2-gas-energy-uk-house-prices-markets-ftse-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Petrol retailers say recovery from fuel crisis is too slow; inflation warnings rise – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up. UK petrol retailers have called for an independent inquiry into the UK’s fuel crisis. The PRA reported that just 71% of forecourts in London and the south east are offering petrol and diesel again, two weeks after panic buying began, and claimed that “failed government intervention and inappropriate prioritisation” are leading to “chaotic delivery schedules”. The Bank of England’s new chief economist warned that the UK is facing a longer and larger spike in inflation than expected. Huw Pill told MPs that “the current strength of inflation looks set to prove more long lasting than originally anticipated.” The pound has rallied, up half a cent at $1.3635, as traders anticipate that the Bank could be pushed into raising interest rates in the coming months. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has reiterated that ministers won’t bail out struggling energy suppliers, despite predictions that more could fail this winter, and that bills will surge again next spring. The founder of green energy supplier Ecotricity accused the government of “killing energy companies right now” by operating a retail price cap but not a wholesale one. Dale Vince told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s illogical to hold prices at one end of the supply chain and not the other end, and the natural consequence is companies going out of business. “The government currently have closed their eyes and ears to this and said they don’t care, they’re not going to help energy companies but that kind of misses the point because they’re killing energy companies right now.” Gas prices have eased back, after Russia appeared to use the crisis as leverage to get its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline approved: But....the National Grid’s electricity system operator, ESO, warned that the risk of winter blackouts has increased after a fire affecting a key subsea cable further eroded Great Britain’s backup electricity supply cushion. UK industrial groups said the warning highlighted the need for emergency measures to keep factories running this winter. The supply chain crisis continued.... Nearly one in three UK firms saw the price paid for materials, goods or services jump by more than “normal price fluctuations” in early September, with builders worst hit. One in 10 firms said they’d hiked prices last month, by more than usual. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, says there are rising concerns that the UK is being caught in an inflationary spiral ‘’The anecdotes from truckers, turkey farmers, builders and bosses about escalating problems in the supply chain are far from isolated cases. Rising costs hitting industries across the board are backed up in the latest large scale survey from the ONS. The Business Insights research shows that almost a third of businesses (29%) questioned reported that the price of materials, goods and services purchased over the last fortnight had increased by more than normal price fluctuations. The situation is particularly acute in the construction industry, given that more than half of firms surveyed said prices had increased higher than usual levels over the last two weeks. Costs of materials like bricks, timber and steel were already rising before this week’s latest spike in gas prices, with companies like British Steel hiking costs per tonne by £30 last week because of escalating energy and haulage costs. Over in Germany, industrial production tumbled by 4% as supply chain bottlenecks hit factories. But there’s a welcome drop in weekly jobless claims in the US.... ...where Senate leaders have also hammered out a short-term deal to extend the debt ceiling, giving a couple of months grace. This has driven markets higher, with the FTSE 100 index closing 82 points higher at 7078, up 1.1% today. UK house prices continued to surge, up 1.7% in September alone: Sky is to launch its own range of smart TVs, removing the need for customers to use a satellite dish or set-top box. The competition regulator has dropped its investigation into whether British Airways and Ryanair broke the law by failing to offer refunds to customers who could not legally take their flights because of coronavirus restrictions – but said the airlines should have given them their money back... And finally....the maker of Quality Street has said the supply chain crisis may affect deliveries of some of its confectionery in the run-up to Christmas. Goodnight. GW Media news: Sky is launching its own range of smart TVs, removing the need for customers to use a satellite dish or set-top box. The move shows the pay-TV company is shifting its offering to remain competitive in the streaming era. The broadband-powered TV set, called Sky Glass, will be launched in the UK on 18 October and in Sky’s other European markets next year. The new service will aggregate content from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, as well as Sky channels and content from other broadcasters. More here: Back in the markets, shares are pushing higher after US Senate leaders agreed a temporary deal to extend the debt ceiling. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has announced there is an agreement between him and minority leader Mitch McConnell on suspending the debt limit through early December. “We have reached agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early December and it’s our hope we can get this done as soon as today,” Schumer said referring to a vote on passage of the legislation. That will avert the risk that the US defaults on its debts later this month, which would have triggered turmoil in the markets. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 531 points, or 1.5%, to 34,948, with the broaded S&amp;P 500 up 1.4%. Every sector is up. European stock markets have pushed higher too, with the FTSE 100 index now up 94 points or 1.3% in late trading at 7090 points. The PRA have also argued that the UK’s shift towards less polluting petrol was a ‘major factor’ in the fuel crisis. They say the switch to E10 petrol (which contains more renewable ethanol than the E5 blend) led forecourts to run down supplies. Government data this morning (see here) showed that fuel stocks had dipped in September before the panic buying began... and the PRA reckons the move to E10 is behind it. The Telegraph explains: Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the data showed that the fuel crisis had been an “unintended consequence” of the Government’s switch to greener petrol. “For weeks we had been emptying our tanks of E5, the old fuel, as fast as we could to get ready for E10. We had all run our petrol stocks down,” Mr Madderson said. “So when the panic buying started, many of our members ran out pretty quickly. Then the shortage of HGV drivers meant we couldn’t get supplies quickly enough. “I don’t blame the Government particularly but the E10 switchover clearly had an unintended consequence: we couldn’t cope with the surge in demand.” UK’s petrol retailers are calling for an independent inquiry into the fuel crisis, warning that the recovery is happening too slowly. The Petrol Retailers Association says that fuel stations still aren’t being restocked fast enough, two weeks after the crisis began. Its members report that just 71% of filling stations in London and the South East of England are offering both petrol and diesel today, compared to 90% in the rest of the country. That leaves 12% of filling stations in London and the South East still dry, while 17% have just one grade of fuel. Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, (whose members operate around two-thirds of forecourts) says: “The recovery is simply not happening quickly enough. We are into our 15th day of the crisis. There needs to be an independent inquiry into the crisis, so that motorists are protected from such acute fuel shortages in the future. The PRA says that the “current inept prioritisation policy” is not working, and that the government’s decision to suspend competition law to help energy firms work together “has been a failed experiment”. Madderson claims that fuel supplies are being sent to the wrong parts of the UK: “Since the Downstream Oil Protocol was invoked at 20:00 hrs on Sunday 26 September (more than ten days ago), we understand that meetings have taken place between BEIS and specialist hauliers and oil companies. These meetings were supposed to involve information sharing so that deliveries went to the areas where there were acute shortages. The independent dealer network (which numbers 65% of the total) has not had access to any of the information which was supposed to have been shared. We do not know when the deliveries are arriving and we do not know how they are being prioritised. The PRA wrote to BEIS to ask how the suspension of competition law would benefit our dealers and we have not yet received a reply. As things stand, we are yet to see any benefits arising from the suspension of competition law. Fuel supplies are being sent to the wrong parts of the country, giving oil companies an excuse not to fulfil the spirit of their contracts with our members. Madderson adds the petrol retailers in London and the south east of England have seen ‘chaotic’ delivery schedules during the crisis: “Our members in London and the South East are indignant that the fuel crisis persists for a 15th day, as a result of failed government intervention and inappropriate prioritisation. They report chaotic delivery schedules, including one case of a tanker having to return to the depot full because it had arrived at a filling station which had just been stocked. “Whilst we thank the Government for making available drivers from the military (which may in time feed through to increased supplies), suspending competition law has been a failed experiment. It is now time for the Government to step back, reimpose competition law, and restore market disciplines so that ordinary business incentives drive the fuel to the filling stations which need it. The lesson for us all may be that, however well-intentioned the Government is, regrettably, officials do not have the ability nor the capacity to command and control a crisis such as this. UK natural gas prices remain calmer today, after dropping back from their record levels. The contract for gas delivery next month is down 10% today at 245p per therm. That’s down on yesterday’s spike over 400p, but still painfully high for suppliers. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, says: Russia’s offer to ease Europe’s energy crunch has been the biggest talking point in the markets today, as gas prices sold off. Russia wants to get the ball rolling on its controversial Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, would be one way to solve Europe’s energy crisis. Although it remains uncertain whether Russia will be granted the approval, investors know the pressure is growing on European leaders to do something about the surging energy prices – and fast. Along with natural gas prices, both crude oil contracts sold off yesterday and although we saw further downside follow-through earlier in today’s session, oil prices have since bounced off their lows to turn flat. Natural gas prices remained lower on the day at the time of writing, but likewise off their lows. The key question is whether energy prices will head lower from here, or if this is just a pause before we see more gains. The maker of Quality Street has said the supply chain crisis may affect deliveries of some of its confectionery in the run-up to Christmas. Mark Schneider, the chief executive of Nestlé, said: “Like other businesses we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues, but it’s our UK team’s top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them.” When asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas, he told the BBC: “We are working hard.” In a later statement, Nestlé – which also makes Smarties, Milkybars, Aeros, KitKats and Lion bars, said there would be plenty of Quality Street to go around this festive season.... More here: In the US, the number of people filing new claims for jobless support has dropped for the first time in four weeks. There were just 326,000 initial unemployment claims filed in the week to Saturday October 2nd, down from 364,000 the previous week. That 38,000 drop suggests that the labor market is recovering from the disruption caused by Hurricane Ida, and the jump in Delta variant cases that hit the US this summer. The initial jobless claims total had risen for the previous three weeks. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, predicts that jobless claims will keep falling towards their pre-pandemic levels (in the low 200,000s): “The three-week detour away from declining jobless claims appears to have ended. While the most recent week is above the pandemic-era low of 312,000 a month ago, we may be able to chalk the temporary rise to a combination of reporting issues in some states, layoffs from hurricanes and maybe the spike in the COVID-19 Delta wave. With Delta infections dropping rapidly and hurricane effects mostly finished, we should resume the path toward normal levels of weekly layoffs, about 100,000 less than current levels.” The number of Americans on jobless support for at least two weeks (the continuing claims total) has also dropped, points out Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor: The Bank of England’s new chief economist has warned that the UK is facing a longer and larger spike in inflation than expected. Huw Pill told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the concerns about rising price pressures are increasing. In a questionnaire to the committee, he says that ongoing global supply chain disruption, high demand, and rising raw material costs have pushed up imported goods prices, lifting UK inflation. As the pandemic recedes and the level and composition of global demand and supply normalise, these inflationary pressures should subside. But the magnitude and duration of the transient inflation spike is proving greater than expected. Pill also told MPs that the UK appears to be facing an ‘adverse supply shock’ as firms struggle to hire workers. He also predicts that energy bills could jump again when the price cap is reassessed next spring (as analysts also fear), saying: Taking the August Monetary Policy Report as the benchmark, over recent months inflation has surprised to the upside, UK activity data have disappointed somewhat, while the labour market has tightened. This combination has all the hallmarks of an adverse supply shock, centred on mismatches in the labour market. Supply problems within the UK owe to the ‘pingdemic’ and shortages of specific skills (such as HGV drivers). Moreover, the rise in wholesale gas prices threatens to raise retail energy costs next year, sustaining CPI inflation rates above 4% into 2022 Q2. Pill joined the Bank of England last month, replacing Andy Haldane who left in June (warning that his Bank colleagues were too relaxed about inflation). Pill explains that the “benign view” is that these supply constraints as temporary, and that ending the furlough scheme will release more workers into the labour market. But a “malign view” sees mismatches as persistent or even structural, and that ending furlough simply drives up long-term unemployment. Reality will lie somewhere between these two polar characterisations of the risks, says Pill, adding: In my view, that balance of risks is currently shifting towards great concerns about the inflation outlook, as the current strength of inflation looks set to prove more long lasting than originally anticipated. UK petrol station stocks were already lower than normal before last month’s panic buying left many forecourts dry, new government figures show. Fuel stock and sales data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show that average stock levels had dropped to 33% for several days up to Wednesday 22nd September. That’s down from around 40% in July, or 45% in late January 2020 before the pandemic hit the UK (which is a normal level). Stocks dipped to 32% on Thursday 23rd, the day when reports that BP was preparing to ration fuel deliveries due to driver shortages hit the media. On Friday, when queues began, stock levels shrank to 20%, and slumped again to just 15% on Saturday 25th September as panic buying gripped the UK (14% for petrol, and 17% for diesel). The figures also show that levels recovered slowly last week, after an increase in deliveries. They reached 25% by Sunday 3rd October, just before the military began helping to restock. But there was a clear regional difference. Last Sunday, stock levels in Scotland had recovered to 35%, with north east England at 33%, while London was still at 18%, and the south east of England just 16%. UK firms were hit by rising prices last month, forcing many to lift their own costs. Nearly 30% of companies saw the price paid for materials, goods or services jump by more than “normal price fluctuations” in early September. That included more than half of construction firms, and almost half of manufacturers, as supply chain problems hit the economy. That’s according to the Office for National Statistics’s latest survey of the impact of the pandemic, and other events. It also found that 10% of firms have hiked their prices by more than normal - including a quarter of manufacturers, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The report also found that 22% of firms reported that a lack of hauliers to transport goods or lack of logistics equipment had hit their efforts to import goods. That’s up from 11% in late April 2021, showing that the lorry driver shortage is hitting businesses. The ONS explains: The wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles industry reported the largest percentage of lack of hauliers to transport goods or lack of logistics equipment as a challenge at 26%. Additional paperwork and change in transportation costs remained the biggest challenges to both importing and exporting goods. Here’s our news story on the jump in UK house prices last month, with Wales and Scotland leading the way: The competition regulator has dropped its investigation into whether British Airways and Ryanair broke the law by failing to offer customers refunds who couldn’t legally take their flights because of pandemic restrictions – but said the airlines should have given them their money back. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is scrapping its four-month investigation due to a “lack of clarity in the law [which] makes it insufficiently certain that it would be able to secure refunds for customers”. More here: Kwasi Kwarteng is also continuing to rule out any bailouts for energy suppliers who risk collapse due to the energy price spike. He told industry leaders at the Energy UK conference that it is going to be “a difficult time”. We may well see more companies leave the market (although Kwarteng doesn’t want to prejudge this). And despite the pressure on the industry from record wholesale prices, Kwarteng insists that: “The most vulnerable must continue to be protected from exorbitant price spikes”. [He’s insisted before that the energy price cap will stay, even though suppliers face surging costs, if they haven’t hedged against them]. Reuters have more details: Britain’s energy minister warned on Thursday more energy companies could go bust amid record prices, but ruled out offering any support to struggling firms. Soaring wholesale energy prices have led some energy suppliers to collapse, with nine going bust in September alone. “We may well see companies going out of the market,” Kwasi Kwarteng told the Energy UK conference. Kwarteng said the government would not provide support to struggling energy suppliers and that the current system was working, with a supplier of last resort appointed by regulator Ofgem to take on the customers from any failed companies. “Government will not bail out failed companies, there cannot be a reward for irresponsible management,” he said. In the longer-term, Britain’s plan to produce only “clean” energy by 2035, which could be renewable power such as wind or solar or nuclear power generation, will ultimately help to protect consumers, Kwarteng said. Kwarteng also said the government was aiming to get at least one new large scale nuclear plant to financial investment decision by the end of this parliament, which could run until 2024. The British government is confident the country’s energy supplies will meet demand this winter, energy and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng has said. Kwarteng told the Energy UK conference that more suppliers could exit the market (as analysts have also predicted, given the surge in wholesale energy prices): “We may well see companies going out of the market.” He also argued that decarbonising the UK’s power supply will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices in the long term: “The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices... “Relying on homegrown power generation will protect consumers from gas price fluctuations. And it will, in the long run, bring down bills, we will use the wealth of Britain’s natural resources to deliver cleaner, cheaper power.” (thanks to PA Media for the quotes) UK industry is urging the government, and Ofgem, to implement “emergency measures this winter” to help power-hungry sectors keep running. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) says the National Grid’s warning of a greater risk of blackouts (see earlier post) emphasizes the need for Government and Ofgem to implement emergency measures this winter. The EIUG represents a swathe of manufacturers, such as steel, chemicals, paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics and industrial gases. They are calling for measures to ensure reliable energy that isn’t prone to emergency interruption this winter, and available at affordable prices that let its members keep operating.. EIUG Chair, Dr Richard Leese, warned that current energy prices are uneconomical: ‘The issue is not just whether the supply of gas and electricity will be available but also one of price. Energy intensive industries could simply be priced out of the market. This danger is massively heightened given this winter’s global energy outlook plus competition from Europe and other parts of the world for gas, including LNG. The surge in energy prices this autumn has pushed the market towards ‘demand destruction’ mode, the point where costs are too high that users cut back. Reuters analyst John Kemp explained yesterday: Energy bills could rise by as much as 30% next year if gas and electricity prices continue to soar and more suppliers go bust, according to a new report. Research firm Cornwall Insight is forecasting that the energy price cap, set at a record £1,277 a year from 1 October, is going to have to be significantly boosted in spring 2022 as the energy crisis continues. The firm expects the energy price cap to be put up by about 30%, to around £1,660, by the industry regulator. Ofgem has said that if gas prices rise, or stay at such elevated levels, it will have to push the price cap up when it is reviewed on 1 April. Craig Lowery, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight, warned: “With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on the edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,” Stocks have opened higher in London, as anxiety over the energy price crunch eases. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is up 50 points, or 0.75%, at 7046 points - recovering some of Wednesday’s 1.1% drop. Mining companies are leading the rises, indicating that fears over the economic outlook are easing. Copper producer Antofagasta are up 3.15%, followed by Anglo American (+3%). Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says the spike in energy prices has unsettled investors: “Risk appetite has briefly returned for investors, although sentiment remains delicately poised. Progress on debt ceiling talks in the US seems to suggest a temporary deal to avoid default, which gave markets a shot in the arm as the trading session progressed. At the same time, indications that Russia may be stepping up gas supplies also steadied energy prices, which have been the main culprit for the volatility which is currently being experienced. The risk of winter blackouts has increased after a fire affecting a key subsea cable further eroded Great Britain’s backup electricity supply cushion, already diminished by the shutdown of gas plants and nuclear reactors. The National Grid’s electricity system operator, ESO, said the “de-rated margin” – the amount of excess capacity that could be called upon if needed – was expected to be 6.6% or 3.9 gigawatts (GW). That would be higher than the margins seen in 2015-16 and the following year. But the ESO said a worst-case scenario, such as multiple power plant outages, low wind speeds, and a bitterly cold winter, could cause the margin plunge to just 4.2%, or 2.5GW. That would be well below the 5.1% it forecast in 2015, before a notoriously difficult winter when National Grid was forced to ask businesses to reduce their electricity usage to keep the lights on. With margins likely to be tighter than the Grid would like, it expects to issue a similar number of electricity market notices to last year, when it sent six of the official pleas to energy suppliers to increase the amount of electricity they make available. The ESO took the unusual step this year of issuing an early version of its Winter Outlook, its annual assessment of Great Britain’s electricity safety net. Here’s the full story: Dale Vince, founder of green energy supplier Ecotricity, has accused the UK government of “killing energy companies right now” through the retail price cap. Vince told Radio 4’s Today programme that the government should either let energy be a free market, or nationalise it. Vince explained that the price cap means companies are being forced to sell power and gas for a lower price than they can buy on the wholesale market. That’s why 12 have gone out of business this year. He said: It doesn’t make sense to have a retail price cap but not a wholesale one. Fifty percent of Britain’s gas today comes from the North Sea, our North Sea. Those operators’ cost of operation has not gone up, but they’re selling their gas at five times what they did in January. They’re making billions, while the government resists the natural ability of energy companies to put their prices up to stay in business, in order to save consumers from, basically, world events. Vince argues that it’s “illogical” to hold prices at one end of the supply chain and not the other end, and the natural consequence is companies going out of business. “The Government currently have closed their eyes and ears to this and said they don’t care, they’re not going to help energy companies but that kind of misses the point because they’re killing energy companies right now.” The government should get out of the energy market, argues Vince -- “either let it be a free market, or nationalise it”. “At the moment it’s neither one thing nor the other.” That cap rose at the start of October, hitting families with higher bills. But it’s likely to rise again in April, possibly by hundreds of pounds more, given the jump in wholesale price in recent weeks. Asked if there is a “compelling argument” for the industry to be brought back under state control, Vince adds: “Absolutely. “I’ve been saying that probably for the last decade, because, you know, energy is of vital national importance and at times like this, we can see that. “These energy crises of the winter - they come around every three or four years. This is not a new event.” Vince adds that Vladimir Putin made “perfect sense” yesterday, when he said Europe’s energy crisis was partly caused by the move to buying gas at “spot prices” not long-term contracts. It’s the pinnacle of the free market, where the price changes every day In doing that we’ve exposed ourselves to incredible fluctuations. The price of gas for next-day delivery in the UK has also dropped this morning. It’s down 5.8% to 218p per therm, after a wild day’s trading yesterday when it briefly hit 355p per therm (a record). UK wholesale gas prices have dropped in early trading, away from yesterday’s record highs. The contract for delivery next month has fallen by 16% to around 229p per therm - having spiked over 400p yesterday, before Vladimir Putin said Russia was prepared to stabilise the market. The benchmark Dutch wholesale gas contract for November delivery has also dropped, as Europe’s energy crunch eases a little..... The supply chain crisis is hurting Germany’s factories badly. German industrial output fell 4% in August, as disruptions and shortages of key parts such as semiconductors hits factories. Automakers were particularly hit. Production of cars and car parts fell by 17.5% on the month, while manufacture of machinery and equipment was down 6.3%. The Federal Statistics Office says: Producers continue to report production being constrained by a shortage of supply of intermediate products. Annual house price inflation is weakest in the South and East of England, Halifax adds, with London (where average prices are highest) lagging. The South West remains the strongest performing region in England, with annual house price growth of 9.7% (average house price of £276,226). The North West saw the next biggest increase, with house prices up by 9% year-on-year (average house price of £201,927), marginally ahead of Yorkshire and Humber at 8.9% (average house price of £186,815). Eastern England has seen annual growth of 7.2% (average house price of £310,664) while in the South East it’s 7% (average house price of £360,795). Greater London remains the outlier, with annual growth of just 1% (average house price of £510,515), and was again the only region or nation to record a fall in house prices over the latest rolling three-monthly period (-0.1%). British house prices rose at the fastest rate in almost 15 years in September, the final month before the stamp duty tax break finally ended in England and Northern Ireland. Mortgage lender Halifax has reported that prices rose by 1.7% during September, the biggest monthly increase since February 2007. That lifts the annual rate of house price inflation up to 7.4% from 7.2% in August, with the average property now costing a record £267,587. Wales and Scotland continue to outperform the UK average, Halifax reports. Wales saw 11.5% house price growth in September, with Scotland up 8.3% -- even though stamp duty tax breaks in both countries ended earlier in the year. Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director, said a shortage of homes for sale was pushing up prices, along with demand for larger home following the move towards home working in the pandemic. Galley explained: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in England – and a desire amongst homebuyers to close deals at speed – may have played some part in these figures, it’s important to remember that most mortgages agreed in September would not have completed before the tax break expired. This shows that multiple factors have played a significant role in house price developments during the pandemic. “The ‘race-for-space’ as people changed their preferences and lifestyle choices undoubtedly had a major impact. Looking at price changes over the past year, prices for flats are up just 6.1%, compared to 8.9% for semi-detached properties and 8.8% for detached. This translates into cash increases for detached properties of nearly £41,000 compared to just £6,640 for flats. Galley also warned that demand may be cooling: “Against a backdrop of rising pressures on the cost of living and impending increases in taxes, demand might be expected to soften in the months ahead, with some industry measures already indicating lower levels of buyer activity. Nevertheless, low borrowing costs and improving labour market prospects for those already in employment are likely to continue to provide support. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, points out that the ‘race for space’ is one of several factors: Here’s Bloomberg’s take on Russia’s move: On a chaotic day that saw European benchmark gas surge 40% in a few minutes, Putin eased prices by offering to help stabilize the situation. Russia could potentially export record volumes of the vital fuel to the continent this year, he said. Quick certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline would be one way to achieve this, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Russia’s message is pretty obvious, says Jeffrey Halley, analyst at OANDA: Putin sparked a near 10% sell-off in natural gas prices overnight after he offered to “stabilise” the natural gas market in Europe by potentially pumping more supplies through the Ukraine. The Russian Vice-President also mentioned certifying Nord Stream 2 once again as a potential solution to Europe’s gaseous woes. President Putin also alluded to the benefit of long-term as to short-term supply contracts. Mr Putin’s comments were high on rhetoric but very low on detail such as how much and when. The message is fairly clear though, you can have all the gas you want in the future, you just need to sign here…. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the UK’s supply chain crisis and business. The surge in energy prices gripping Europe has eased a little, as Russia tries to use its leverage as an oil and gas superpower to assist -- and get approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 undersea natural gas pipeline. UK gas prices fell back from record highs after president Vladimir Putin suggested that state-backed Gazprom could increase supplies to help Europe avoid a full-blown energy crisis. At a televised meeting on Wednesday, Putin hinted: “Let’s think through the potential increase of supply on the market, only we need to do it carefully.” Moscow appears to be using the crisis to push for Nord Stream 2 to get the green light. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that approval for Nord Stream 2, which connects Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, could cool soaring European gas prices. Novak told a meeting of government officials and heads of energy companies. “I think there are two factors, which could somewhat cool off the current situation. First of all, of course, this is, definitely, completion of certification and the fastest clearance for gas supplies via the completed Nord Stream 2,” These comments dragged gas prices back from record levels last night, in wild trading. UK gas contracts for November delivery surged almost 40% early on Wednesday over 400p per therm, but closed 9% lower at 271p. But Nord Stream 2 is controversial - it circumvents Ukraine, which relies on existing pipelines for income, and still needs to be certified by Germany’s regulator. Back in March, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned it was “a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security”. Nord Stream 2 needs approval from the energy regulator in Berlin to start operating commercially. They need to be satisfied that it meets EU ‘unbundling’ rules separating of gas transport from production and sales -- a certification process that could take months. And some EU MEPs are worried that Nord Stream 2 may decide to start flows without the necessary approvals. Senior lawmakers on Tuesday called on the European Commission to exercise all its powers to ensure compliance with EU law, Bloomberg reports. European stock markets are on track to recover yesterday’s losses, with the FTSE 100 called up over 1%. Investors are relieved that Republicans and Democrats in Congress said they would consider a stop-gap measure extending the country’s borrowing limit until December. It would be a temporary solution to America’s debt ceiling crisis, which is threatening an unprecedented default.

New offshore wind projects will power millions of British homes under “zero-subsidy” support contracts within the next four years, following a record-breaking government subsidy auction. On Friday, the results of the auction showed offshore wind costs had tumbled by a third to about £40 per megawatt hour, which is less than the price of electricity in the wholesale energy market. This means households will not face extra costs to support the new projects, which may even help to bring down energy bills. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: “It’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices. Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.” New subsidy contracts will be handed to energy companies including Norway’s state-owned Equinor for four new windfarms on remote islands, and another six windfarms off the coasts of England and Scotland. They are expected to start powering UK homes within the next four years. Most of the projects will receive as little as £39.65 for every megawatt hour of electricity they produce. The most expensive projects to win a subsidy contract will cost £41.61/MWh. The winning bidders include Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, and SSE, which together plan to build the world’s largest offshore wind project in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea. They are aiming to develop an “industrial wind hub” made up of three interconnected offshore windfarms with a total capacity of about 3.6 gigawatts, enough electricity to power the equivalent of 4.5m UK homes. Eldar Sætre, the chief executive of Equinor, said the Dogger Bank project would be able to deliver low-cost energy due to the “excellent wind speeds, shallow waters and scale”. He added: “A full-scale development of Dogger Bank will constitute an industrial wind hub in the heart of the North Sea, playing a major role in the UK’s ambitions for offshore wind and supporting the net zero ambition.” Hugh McNeal, the chief executive of RenewableUK, said the subsidy results marked “a new era of cheap power, as the cost of offshore wind is now lower than the expected market price for power. Reaching that ‘zero-subsidy’ level is made possible by the certainty these long-term contracts provide.” Offshore wind has plummeted below the cost of fossil fuels in just over half a decade. The earliest offshore windfarms in the UK received contracts worth about £120/MWh in 2015. Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy and clean growth minister, said: “The support we’re announcing today will mean that over 7m more homes will be powered by renewable energy as we decarbonise our energy system – crucial as we continue on the road to net zero emissions by 2050.” Two windfarms, the Hornsea 2 project off the Yorkshire coast and the Moray offshore windfarm in Scotland, secured a guaranteed price for their electricity of £57.50/MWh through a similar auction two years ago. The sums were nearly half the £92.50/MWh awarded the year before to Britain’s first new nuclear power site in a generation, Hinkley Point C. The plummeting cost of offshore wind is attracting more interest from major energy companies. Earlier this week, the Crown Estate opened what is expected to be its most competitive leasing round for new seabed licences to host the next generation of wind projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:03:38Z","webTitle":"UK missing deadlines for post-Brexit nuclear safeguards, leak shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/16/uk-missing-deadlines-for-post-brexit-nuclear-safeguards-leak-shows","fields":{"headline":"UK missing deadlines for post-Brexit nuclear safeguards, leak shows","bodyText":"Brexit deadlines have put the supply of nuclear raw material for power stations at risk, a leaked government document has suggested. The document, obtained by Sky News, shows that the UK is already missing critical deadlines to put full safeguards in place to keep the flow of components and raw material needed to fabricate nuclear fuel after Brexit. The UK does not produce uranium. It must have its own safety measures in place, including a governing body to regulate the safe transport of the raw material, once it leaves the European safeguarding body Euroatom after Brexit. Five “high-level risks” in setting up this government body have been identified by the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, according to an internal “risk register” paper obtained by Sky. Work on a new IT system, which should have started by the end of March, is already behind and the deadline has already been “irretrievable lost”, the document says. The other four areas categorised as “red” on a red, amber, green (RAG) project management ranking including recruitment, lack of training for inspectors and funding. Failure to arrange the “comprehensive handover” of hardware from Euratom are also cited in the document. The document was leaked just days after the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, warned that Britain could have a period with no nuclear fuel unless the safeguards were in place in time. “Whilst you may have a stock of raw material to be able to produce fuel. Eventually, you are going to be in the position where you use that up,” said Greatrex. He told Sky News the Brexit decision had created “a very exacting timetable” to set up the independent British body and there was “no shortcut” to achieve it. Scientists have warned that British power stations may not be able to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders. There have also been reports that shipment of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment could be jeopardised. “We could end up in a situation where you have got a perfectly well-functioning fleet of nuclear power stations but we haven’t got enough fuel ... We don’t want to end up in the position where we have got power stations and haven’t got fuel,” Greatrex told reporters on Monday. The government said the UK’s ability to import medical radioisotopes from Europe and the rest of the world would not be affected by Brexit as they are not subject to international safeguards. A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had made “significant progress in preparing to leave Euratom to ensure safeguards are in place from day one”. “The nuclear safeguards bill is making good progress through parliament and we continue to work closely with the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure we continue to have a robust regime in place.” The spokesman added that the UK had signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US, which it was hoped would be the first of a series of deals to ensure no disruption to the nuclear supply chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-20T17:30:08Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on transport emissions: the trouble with planes and automobiles | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on transport emissions: the trouble with planes and automobiles","bodyText":"If the success of an event like Friday’s school strike can be measured, it is in the extent to which it changes the climate of opinion. Individuals, unions and other organisations that took part in the strike must play their part in reducing emissions. But when it comes to limiting global heating, governments have far more levers than anyone else. Global cooperation by politicians is essential to tackling the climate emergency. Since states are the world’s most powerful organisations, many of the solutions will inevitably be national. In terms of their current and historic carbon emissions, and efforts to reduce them, there are huge differences between countries. There is no one-size-fits-all model of decarbonisation. In the UK, like everywhere else, progress is nowhere near fast enough. Carbon dioxide emissions have been falling for six years, and are at their lowest level since the reign of Queen Victoria. A law passed in June commits the government to reduce them to net zero by 2050, with any residual greenhouse gas pollution offset by emissions-reduction schemes. But the energy policies pursued by Theresa May’s and David Cameron’s governments were more harmful than beneficial, with the deeply unpopular fracking industry propped up, and the astronomically expensive Hinkley Point C nuclear power station pushed through, while the wind and solar industries were attacked through the removal of subsidies – even though Conservative voters, like everyone else, prefer wind energy to fracking by a huge margin. The official body that advises the UK government on climate change has warned that we are on course to miss the targets set out in the carbon budgets covering the years 2023-32, with just seven out of 24 indicators showing progress in 2018. In fact, the headline figure of a 44% fall in emissions below the 1990 baseline conceals multiple failures, with almost all the advances of recent years due to decarbonisation of the energy supply and phase-out of coal. Home insulation is one area where there has been little improvement. Farming is another. But since transport overtook energy to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions in 2016 – making up 33% of the total, higher than in much of the EU, where closer to 25% is typical – it is arguably here that policymakers and others should most urgently focus attention. Motor vehicles, which are responsible for around a fifth of the UK’s total emissions, are by far the worst offender. The solution to the problem they present is relatively simple, but that does not make it easy. Bringing forward a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040 to 2035 or sooner, imposing strict regulations on heavy goods vehicles, and investing in electric car manufacturing and infrastructure, would please some people. So would increasing spending on public transport, reducing traffic in cities using congestion charging, and promoting walking and cycling with schemes such as car-free days. London will have its first such event on Sunday, four years after Paris. Such policies reduce the harm associated with air pollution, and make urban environments quieter and safer. But since many people enjoy driving and feel entitled to use their cars, they are also politically challenging. The same goes for any attempt to reduce air travel. But with figures this week showing that aviation emissions are rising much faster than expected, and that the UK, with a 4% global share, is behind only the US and China, reduce it we must. People should be encouraged to think about their transport decisions. But climate action must never be reduced to individual choices, and the onus is on politicians of all parties, starting with government ministers, to be brave. Momentum following this week’s demonstrations must not give way to drift. Big steps to reduce transport emissions would be one good way to keep moving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2019/oct/26/uk-economy-high-rents-eating-away-at-future-public-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-26T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"We all want to live the good life – but how can we afford it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/26/uk-economy-high-rents-eating-away-at-future-public-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/oct/26/uk-economy-high-rents-eating-away-at-future-public-spending","fields":{"headline":"We all want to live the good life – but how can we afford it?","bodyText":"A 21st-century life costs too much. At least, the glistening modernity we seek in all aspects of our lives costs too much. There is widespread agreement that Britons deserve the best healthcare modern methods, equipment and trained staff can provide. There are transport networks desperately in need of funding for upgrades and much-needed maintenance, and for new railway lines to take polluting and carbon-generating cars off the road. The costs run into billions of pounds. Talking of cars, we want subsidy schemes to swap the UK’s current complement of 39 million petrol and diesel vehicles (cars, lorries and buses) to something more environmentally friendly. When no more than 250,000 currently comply with the definition of environmentally friendly, that’s a tall order. Sticking to the environmental theme, millions of homes need to be insulated and there need to be more of them, preferably offering subsidised rents, to accommodate millennials currently living with their parents and the extra 220,000 legal migrants who arrive each year and want somewhere to live. There are campaigns to keep TV licences free for the 3.7 million aged over 75 while the BBC, which is currently suffering huge cuts to the finance needed to cover most of that £750m cost, should remain well funded to maintain its role as a cornerstone of British values. The eclectic and long wish list goes on and on, spanning calls for a sophisticated border force ready to keep out illegal immigrants and a national superfast broadband network to making sure that the Royal Navy, which has admitted that a quarter of its 76 ships are unseaworthy, has enough money to refit them. These bills add up to hundreds of billions of pounds over the next 20 years, a period when the population will age and Brexit will chase away many of those companies that have stationed themselves in the UK exactly to benefit from access to the EU. This is all before we have reviewed the broader welfare system and decided how much more money it needs to provide a decent living for disabled people, the elderly and those unable to find work. Such is the shortfall between what we want and what we can afford that something needs to give. We can tax more or borrow more or work harder and produce more stuff to sell. Had the chancellor gone ahead with his planned budget on 6 November, we might have heard a little of his thinking on the subject. Javid said last month he would spend around £13.8bn extra a year, restoring the police and schools budgets to something near to their previous peaks. He has pledged to increase spending on infrastructure and has backed higher spending on health, increasing the NHS budget by £20bn over a decade. But he knows this just scratches the surface of what is needed to make up for nine years of austerity and to keep pace with developments in the digital age. The Tory plan is to limit public spending on infrastructure to the bare minimum, leaving the bulk of the upgrade to the private sector. In the 21st century, that means leaving the building of nuclear power stations to the French, digital infrastructure to the Americans and Chinese, and steel manufacture to the Turkish military pension fund currently in the throes of buying British Steel. These foreign owners want two concessions: firstly to pay zero corporate taxes and, when they provide domestic services, charge a whopping rent. All of this might be affordable if we weren’t paying such high rents to the owners of Britain’s land and property. The US, France and Germany have their property hotspots, yet most of the land remains cheap and rents in large cities can be still be affordable. In the UK, we are all shelling out huge sums on rent and mortgages that could be used to pay tax on collective goods and services, or to buy those goods and services directly. In 2017, the total amount of rent paid by tenants in Britain soared to more than £50bn, more than double the level seen a decade ago. The total level of mortgage payments has changed little in that time, as the old pay off their loans and own homes outright, while the young take on bigger loans over longer periods to pay ever higher property prices. It’s easy to see why the left dodges the issue of rent when so many voters are either landlords themselves, invest in property or think property will one day be their financial saviour. In his book Who Owns England, Guy Shrubsole lays out the problem with startling clarity. He shows that excessive rents are the virus eating away at Britain’s economic future. It should be tackled now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-donetsk-governor-urges-evacuations-amid-russian-offensive","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-07T00:08:57Z","webTitle":"Putin’s forces have made ‘genuine headway’ after capturing Lysychansk, say western officials – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-donetsk-governor-urges-evacuations-amid-russian-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-donetsk-governor-urges-evacuations-amid-russian-offensive","fields":{"headline":"Putin’s forces have made ‘genuine headway’ after capturing Lysychansk, say western officials – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the day’s events below. The capture of the city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine has given Russian forces “genuine headway”, while its forces in the south have shown signs of “better cooperation”, analysts say. Western officials said the sustainability of Russia’s attacks on Ukraine was “challenging”, but described the impact on their munitions and morale as “remarkable”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said heavy weapons from western allies have finally begun working at “full capacity” on frontlines. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian military has been able to target Russian warehouses and locations that are “important for logistics”. Resistance remains ongoing in villages around Lysychansk, where 15,000 civilians remain, according to Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai. On Telegram, Haidai said: “Today’s videos from Lysychansk are painful to watch.” He accused Putin’s troops of engaging in a scorched earth policy, “burning down and destroying everything on their way”. The evacuation of civilians from Sloviansk continued on Wednesday as Russian troops pressed towards the eastern Ukrainian city in their campaign to control the Donbas region. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said that about 23,000 people out of 110,000 were still in Sloviansk but claimed Russia had been unable to surround the city. The governor of Donetsk has also urged the region’s 350,000 people to flee. The battle for Sloviansk is likely to be the next key contest in the struggle for Donbas as Russian forces approach within 16km of the Donetsk town, British intelligence said. Russian forces from the eastern and western groups of forces are likely now around 16km north of Sloviansk as central and southern groups of forces also pose a threat to the town, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Ukraine has rejected the claim that Russian forces destroyed two advanced US-made Himars rocket systems and their ammunition depots in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff said the claims by Russia’s defence ministry were fake and that it was using the US-supplied Himars to inflict “devastating blows” on Russian forces. Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin visited the war-scarred suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv on Wednesday. Martin said he and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed a joint response to the threat to food security, the energy crisis and the preparation of the seventh sanction package against Russia. Martin reiterated his country’s solidarity with Ukraine. The head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, Yevgeny Balitsky, has said the region plans to sell Ukraine’s grain to the Middle East. The main countries involved in the deal were Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain, a charge that Moscow has denied. Russian forces have occupied about 22% of Ukraine’s arable land, according to Nasa’s Harvest mission. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Nasa has been focusing on the impact of the war on the global food system. Its findings have revealed that Ukrainian fields where 28% of winter and 18% of spring crops are sown are under Russian occupation. Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, said he asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin to help import fuel to his country as it faces its worst economic crisis in seven decades. Rajapaksa tweeted that he had a “productive” telephone call with Putin, while thanking him for “all the support extended by his [government] to overcome the challenges of the past. Zelenskiy called on the world’s largest independent oil trader to stop shipping Russian oil, accusing it of “brazen profiteering from blood oil”. Ukraine’s military announced plans to introduce a system of permits that would prohibit men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered. The move, based on legislation from 1992, was intended to enable the country’s armed forces to locate potential conscripts more easily, but it prompted an immediate backlash. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has admitted that he met the former KGB agent, Alexander Lebedev, without officials present while foreign secretary. Johnson told MPs he accepted he met the former KGB agent on a trip to Italy. Asked whether he reported the meeting to officials, Johnson said: ‘I think I did.’ Russia’s parliament has rushed through two bills imposing strict controls on the economy, requiring businesses to supply goods to the armed forces and obliging employees at some firms to work overtime. The bills will allow the government to introduce “special economic measures” once signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. Nearly 9 million people have left Ukraine since Vladimir Putin invaded, the UN refugee agency has said. With Russia stepping up its offensive in the east of the country, there are increasingly loud calls from the Ukrainian authorities for people to escape while they can from frontline areas. Russia’s parliament has rushed through two bills imposing strict controls on the economy, requiring businesses to supply goods to the armed forces and obliging employees at some firms to work overtime. The bills will allow the government to introduce “special economic measures” once signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. “In the context of operations carried out by the armed forces of the Russian Federation outside of Russia, including on the territory of Ukraine, there is a need to repair weapons, military equipment and provide the armed forces with material and technical means,” Reuters cites an explanatory note to one of the bills as reading. The bills were submitted to the lower house State Duma by the Kremlin on 30 June. After being passed on their first reading, Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said further discussion would be held behind closed doors due to national security. According to one of the drafts, the state will be able to purchase goods and services necessary for conducting military special operations from a single supplier without the need for a competitive tender. In addition, businesses will be required by law to supply goods and services necessary for conducting the “special military operation” to the armed forces. A second bill mandates the government to require employees of certain enterprises producing goods and services needed by the Russian military to work overtime. The government may also oblige some employees to work at night, on weekends or during holidays, in return for increased wages. Artillery provided by the west is beginning to work “very powerfully” against Russian forces in Ukraine, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Noting the development in his latest national address, Zelenskiy said: Finally it is felt that the western artillery - the weapons we received from our partners - started working very powerfully. Its accuracy is exactly as needed. Our defenders inflict very noticeable strikes on depots and other spots that are important for the logistics of the occupiers. And this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the Russian army. The losses of the occupiers will only increase every week, as will the difficulty of supplying them.” France is to renationalise its indebted electricity giant EDF in response to the energy crisis aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the country’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, has said. “We must have full control over our electricity production and performance,” Borne told parliament in her first state-of-the-nation speech to parliament on Wednesday, as she tried to court opposition parties to avoid parliamentary deadlock. “We must ensure our sovereignty in the face of the consequences of the war and the colossal challenges to come … That’s why I confirm to you the state’s intention to own 100% of EDF’s capital.” The French state holds an 84% stake in EDF, one of the world’s biggest electricity producers, but the company is facing delays and budget overruns on new nuclear plants in France and Britain, and corrosion problems at some of its ageing reactors, which have heavily hit its shares price in recent months. It’s 1am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said heavy weapons from western allies have finally begun working at “full capacity” on frontlines. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian military has been able to target Russian warehouses and locations that are “important for logistics”. The non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders has called for Ukraine’s internet liberation on Wednesday. “The Russian forces are colonising the Ukrainian digital infrastructure and are installing their telecommunications companies in southern Ukraine,” said Vincent Berthier, the head of RSF’s tech desk. Over 21,000 war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces are being investigated by Ukrainian authorities, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Irina Venediktova. Her office receives reports of 200 to 300 such crimes daily, it said. Russian forces have occupied about 22% of Ukraine’s arable land, according to Nasa’s Harvest mission. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Nasa has been focusing on the impact of the war on the global food system. Its findings have revealed that Ukrainian fields where 28% of winter and 18% of spring crops are sown are under Russian occupation. The evacuation of civilians from Sloviansk continued on Wednesday as Russian troops pressed towards the eastern Ukrainian city in their campaign to control the Donbas region, as Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, visited Kyiv to voice solidarity. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said that about 23,000 people out of 110,000 were still in Sloviansk but claimed Russia had been unable to surround the city. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said heavy weapons from western allies have finally begun working at “full capacity” on frontlines. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said that the Ukrainian military has been able to target Russian warehouses and locations that are “important for logistics”. According to Zelenskiy, the counterattacks have significantly reduced Russia’s offensive potential and that Ukrainian forces have begun advancing in multiple directions including Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The non-governmental organisation Reporters Without Borders has called for Ukraine’s internet liberation on Wednesday. “The Russian forces are colonising the Ukrainian digital infrastructure and are installing their telecommunications companies in southern Ukraine,” said Vincent Berthier, the head of RSF’s tech desk. “This strategy imposes an alternative reality into which the Kremlin has already plunged its own citizens. Ukraine’s occupied networks must be freed at once. The right of Ukrainian citizens to online access to reliable news and information is a matter of life and death in time of war,” he added. In the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, the internet is being diverted towards Russia and is being subject to Kremlin censorship. According to RSF, Kherson’s online news that its residents have access to now passes through two Russian internet service providers. Over 21,000 war crimes allegedly committed by Russian forces are being investigated by Ukrainian authorities, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general Irina Venediktova. Venediktova’s office receives reports of 200 to 300 such crimes daily, it said. Russian forces have occupied around 22% of Ukraine’s arable land, according to NASA’s Harvest mission. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NASA has been focusing on the impact of the war on the global food system. Its findings have revealed that Ukrainian fields where 28% of winter and 18% of spring crops are sown are under Russian occupation. The evacuation of civilians from Sloviansk continued on Wednesday as Russian troops pressed towards the eastern Ukrainian city in their campaign to control the Donbas region, as Ireland’s prime minister visited Kyiv to voice solidarity. Agence France-Presse reports: Sloviansk has been subjected to heavy bombardment in recent days as Russian forces push westwards on day 133 of the invasion. “Twenty years of work; everything is lost. No more income, no more wealth,” Yevgen Oleksandrovych, 66, told AFP as he surveyed the site of his car parts shop, destroyed in Tuesday’s strikes. AFP journalists saw rockets slam into Sloviansk’s marketplace and surrounding streets, with firefighters scrambling to put out the resulting blazes. Around a third of the market in Sloviansk appeared to have been destroyed, with locals coming to see what was left among the charred wreckage. The remaining part of the market was functioning, with a trickle of shoppers coming out to buy fruit and vegetables. “I will sell it out and that’s it, and we will stay home. We have basements, we will hide there. What we can do? We have nowhere to go, nobody needs us,” said 72-year-old greengrocer Galyna Vasyliivna. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said that around 23,000 people out of 110,000 were still in Sloviansk but claimed Russia had been unable to surround the city. “Since the beginning of hostilities, 17 residents of the community have died, 67 have been injured,” he said, adding, “Evacuation is ongoing. We take people out every day.” Many of the evacuees were taken by bus to the city of Dnipro, further west. “The city is well fortified. Russia does not manage to advance to the city,” the mayor said. Vitaliy, a plumber, said his wife and their daughter, who is six months’ pregnant, were evacuated from Sloviansk on Wednesday. “I am afraid for my wife,” he told AFP. “Here, after what happened yesterday, they hit the city centre; need to leave … I sent my wife, and I have no more choice: tomorrow I will join the army.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The governor of Donetsk, the last remaining eastern province of Ukraine partially under Kyiv’s control, has urged the region’s 350,000 people to flee amid reports of fresh deaths and injuries. At least seven civilians have been killed in Russian shelling over the past 24 hours and 25 are said to have been wounded as the Kremlin continues to step up its offensive in eastern Ukraine. The capture of the city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine by Russian forces has meant Moscow has made “genuine headway”, while its forces in the south have shown signs of “better cooperation”, western officials said. Western officials said the sustainability of Russia’s attacks on Ukraine was “challenging”, but described the impact on their munitions and morale as “remarkable”. Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said resistance was ongoing in villages around the city of Lysychansk, where 15,000 civilians remain. On Telegram, Haidai said: “Today’s videos from Lysychansk are painful to watch.” He accused Putin’s troops of engaging in a scorched earth policy, “burning down and destroying everything on their way”. The battle for Sloviansk is likely to be the next key contest in the struggle for Donbas as Russian forces approach within 16km of the Donetsk town, British intelligence said. Russian forces from the eastern and western groups of forces are likely now around 16km north of Sloviansk as central and southern groups of forces also pose a threat to the town, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Ukraine has rejected a claim by Russia’s defence ministry that Moscow’s armed forces had destroyed two advanced US-made Himars rocket systems and their ammunition depots in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff tweeted that the claims by Russia’s defence ministry were fake and that it was using the US-supplied Himars to inflict “devastating blows” on Russian forces. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU needs to make emergency plans to prepare for a complete cut-off of Russian gas. The commission is working on a “European emergency plan” with the first proposals to be presented by the middle of the month, she said. “If worst comes to worst, then we have to be prepared,” she said. Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin visited the war-scarred suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv on Wednesday to reiterate his country’s solidarity with Ukraine. Martin said he and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, discussed a joint response to the threat to food security, the energy crisis and the preparation of the seventh sanction package against Russia. Russia has denied reports that a Russian-flagged ship is being held and investigated by Turkish authorities in the Black Sea port of Karasu over claims its cargo was stolen from Ukraine. Turkish customs officials acted after Kyiv claimed the Zhibek Zholy was illegally transporting 7,000 tonnes of grain out of Russian-occupied Berdiansk, a Ukrainian port in the south-east of the country. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexei Zaitsev, said the ship was “undergoing standard procedures”. The head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, Yevgeny Balitsky, has said the region plans to sell Ukraine’s grain to the Middle East. The main countries involved in the deal were Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain, a charge that Moscow has denied. Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, said he asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin to help import fuel to his country as it faces its worst economic crisis in seven decades. Rajapaksa tweeted that he had a “productive” telephone call with Putin, while thanking him for “all the support extended by his [government] to overcome the challenges of the past. Ukraine’s military has announced plans to introduce a system of permits that would prohibit men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered. The move, based on legislation from 1992, was intended to enable the country’s armed forces to locate potential conscripts more easily, but it prompted an immediate backlash. Latvia is to reinstate compulsory military service amid growing tension with Russia in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Latvia, which borders Belarus and Russia, had scrapped mandatory service a few years after joining the Nato military alliance. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has admitted that he met the former KGB agent, Alexander Lebedev, without officials present while foreign secretary. Johnson told MPs he accepted he met the former KGB agent on a trip to Italy. Asked whether he reported the meeting to officials, Johnson said: ‘I think I did.’ Ukraine’s military has announced plans to introduce a system of permits that would prohibit men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered. The move, based on legislation from 1992, was intended to enable the country’s armed forces to locate potential conscripts more easily, but it prompted an immediate backlash. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised the announcement in his nightly TV address to the nation on Tuesday, saying that the general staff should not make decisions without him. Two parliamentarians immediately filed draft legislation that would scrap the army’s initiative, which they described as “outdated”. It remains unclear if movement permits for men will be introduced, but the army’s announcement highlights the precarious position facing Ukrainian men who could be conscripted to fight at any moment. Since Zelenskiy declared martial law at the start of Russia’s invasion, all Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are eligible for military service and are forbidden from leaving the country. (There are a few exceptions such as men with poor health, or fathers of three or more children.) “I don’t want to fight. I want to continue working,” said Roman, a 31-year-old software developer in Kyiv. “But I also don’t want to think negatively about it because many of my friends have been mobilised and it’s not fair on them. I try not to think that if I’m mobilised it 100% means I will die or be injured or see fighting.” Read the full article by Isobel Koshiw here. A crowdfunded Turkish-made military drone is expected to be delivered “immediately” from Lithuania, the country’s defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas said. The “Vanagas” (which means “Hawk” in Lithuanian), along with ammunition, arrived in the Baltic country on Monday, Anušauskas said. “Very soon it will be delivered to Ukraine,” he tweeted. The crowdfunding campaign raised nearly €6m (£5m) for the Bayraktar TB2 drone over three days last month, before its Turkish manufacturer announced it would donate the drone free of charge. A portion of the crowdfunded funds were used to equip the drone with munitions while the rest went towards humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The capture of the city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine by Russian forces has meant Moscow has made “genuine headway”, while its forces in the south have shown signs of “better cooperation”, western officials said. Western officials said the sustainability of Russia’s attacks on Ukraine was “challenging”, but described the impact on their munitions and morale as “remarkable”. But one official said it “remains highly uncertain whether Russia will secure the limits of Donetsk oblast this year”. Russia has made “some significant command changes” in recent weeks, one official said, notably the recently appointed Gen Sergei Surovikin, who has taken over command of the southern group of forces overseeing the occupation of southern Ukraine and the advances on the Donbas from the south. The official said: He’s a controversial figure even by the standards of Russian general officers. It is unclear whether it’s his influence which has led to the recent successes around Lysychansk, but certainly there’s been better cooperation amongst groups of forces on the Russian side than we saw in the earlier phases of the war. There are “very serious issues” over the stocks of Russian munitions and of morale, an official said, while long-range weapons systems are starting to make a “significant operational difference for Ukraine”. The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has been speaking at a joint news conference with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv. He said the pair discussed a joint response to the threat to food security, the energy crisis and the preparation of the seventh sanction package against Russia. Ukraine “belongs to the European Union”, Martin said, adding that his country would support Kyiv “every step of the way”. Martin said: Russia’s brutal war against this beautiful, democratic country is a gross violation of international law. It is an affront to everything that Ireland stands for. It cannot and it will not be allowed to stand. He pointed out that Ireland had welcomed 40,000 Ukrainians fleeing the war and that they were “welcome to stay in Ireland for as long as they need to”. The US president, Joe Biden, and vice-president, Kamala Harris, have spoken to the wife of the US basketball player, Brittney Griner, who is detained in Russia, the White House said. Biden reassured Cherelle Griner he was “working to secure Brittney’s release as soon as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other US nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world”, the White House said in a statement after the call. From CNN’s Kylie Atwood: Earlier we reported that Boris Johnson has admitted to MPs that he met the former KGB agent, Alexander Lebedev, without officials present while foreign secretary. Asked by Labour’s Dame Diana Johnson at the Commons liaison committee if he met with Lebedev without officials on 28 April 2018, Johnson said: I certainly have met the gentleman in question who used to be the proprietor of the London Evening Standard when I was mayor of London. I certainly am not going to deny having met Alexander Lebedev, I certainly have. He added: I have certainly met him without officials. I met him on a very few occasions. On the occasion you are mentioning, if that was when I was foreign secretary, then yes. Our Luke Harding has tweeted the clip: Ukraine has rejected a claim by Russia’s defence ministry that Moscow’s armed forces had destroyed two advanced US-made Himars rocket systems and their ammunition depots in eastern Ukraine. Russia earlier claimed that its armed forces destroyed two launchers for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) that America and its allies had been supplying to Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff tweeted that the claims were fake and that it was using the US-supplied Himars to inflict “devastating blows” on Russian forces. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. The number of people going hungry in the world has risen by 150 million since the start of the Covid pandemic, the UN has said, warning that the food crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks pushing the worst-hit countries into famine. Globally, the number suffering from chronic undernourishment rose to as many as 828 million last year, a rise of about 46 million on the previous year, and three times that increase if measured since the world shut down due to Covid, a report has found. With the price of fuel, food staples and fertiliser soaring since the invasion of Ukraine, however, that total is expected to rise even further in the next year – a scenario that could see some of the world’s poorest fall into famine, the most extreme form of food deprivation. “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead,” said David Beasley, executive director of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP). “The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilisers as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. “The result will be global destabilisation, starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale,” he warned. “We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.” Due to the uncertainty caused by the lingering impact of Covid shutdowns, the report, released on Wednesday, is unable to give a precise figure for the number of people going hungry in 2021, instead estimating that the total was somewhere between 702 million and 828 million. If the latter, that would equate to about 10.5% of the world population. Nearly 9 million people have left Ukraine since Vladimir Putin invaded, the UN refugee agency has said, as the governor of Donetsk called on civilians still in the region to flee. With Russia stepping up its offensive in the east of the country, there are increasingly loud calls from the Ukrainian authorities for people to escape while they can from frontline areas. The UN refugee agency announced on Wednesday that 8.793 million people had crossed out of Ukraine since 24 February, while Donetsk’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, urged the region’s 350,000 people to flee amid reports of fresh deaths and injuries. Donetsk is the last remaining eastern province of Ukraine partially under Kyiv’s control. Reports suggested on Wednesday that at least seven civilians had been killed in Russian shelling over the past 24 hours and 25 are said to have been wounded. Kyrylenko said two people had died in the region’s central city of Avdiivka while fatalities were also reported in Sloviansk, Krasnohorivka and Kurakhove. “The destiny of the whole country will be decided by the Donetsk region,” Kyrylenko said. “Once there are less people, we will be able to concentrate more on our enemy and perform our main tasks.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

The first rotation of Ukrainian soldiers has arrived in the UK for training, according to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. The training is part of an innovative programme that aims to train up to 10,000 new Ukrainian recruits alongside a £2.3bn military aid package. The US and other allies have called for Russian and Belarusian national governing bodies of sports to be suspended from international sports federations. The Russian embassy in the United States described the move as “Russophobic” and said “sports should stay out of politics.” Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Boris Johnson is still answering questions at the Commons liaison committee, where he was asked whether he met the former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev without officials when he was foreign secretary in April 2018. Johnson says he did meet Lebedev, because he used to own the Evening Standard, but he says he cannot remember when. When pressed, he says he thinks it is correct that he met Lebedev without officials when he was foreign secretary in Italy. Asked if he reported the meeting to his officals, he says he thinks he did. Johnson was referring to this meeting. From the i’s Paul Waugh: And ITV’s Robert Peston: The European parliament has backed plans to label gas and nuclear energy as “green”, rejecting appeals from Ukraine and climate activists that the proposals are a gift to Vladimir Putin. One senior MEP said the vote was a “dark day for the climate”, while experts said the EU had set a dangerous precedent for countries to follow. The row began late last year with the leak of long-awaited details on the EU’s green investment guidebook, intended to help investors channel billions to the clean power transition. The European Commission decided some gas and nuclear projects could be included in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities, subject to certain conditions. Under the plans, gas can be classed as a sustainable investment if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low-carbon gases”. Nuclear power can be called green if a project promises to deal with radioactive waste. Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: “I am in shock. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war paid for by climate-heating fossil fuels and the European parliament just voted to boost billions of funding to fossil gas from Russia. How in the world is that in line with Europe’s stance to protect our planet and stand with Ukraine?” Read the full article here. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee including covering the situation in Ukraine. Asked what he considers victory for Ukraine, Johnson replies that it is ultimately up to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to decide the terms “but he’s been very clear that he would like to return at least to the status quo” before Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Johnson says even if Zelenskiy wanted to do a land deal in exchange for peace, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin isn’t offering any such deal. He says the UK government is helping Ukrainians with de-mining areas of the country and “doing what we can” to help small packets of grain to leave the country on rail routes. As our Andrew Sparrow writes, it is not obvious from the questions that MPs on the committee have been closely following what is happening elsewhere in the building. Andrew is covering the developments from the UK on our politics live blog.

While it has been a very busy day in British politics today, as my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering on our UK politics live blog, there is still some government business being done. Truss, who would be a frontrunner to replace the beleaguered prime minister Boris Johnson, has just tweeted about the process of the UK ratifying Finland and Sweden’s application to join Nato. She said: Important moment signing the instrument of ratification to fast-track Nato membership for Finland &amp; Sweden. It will now go to Washington to come into force. Russian aggression is being met with unity and resolve. Truss then linked to her written statement to parliament which says, in part: The government is committed to strengthening security and defence at home and overseas. A strong Nato is at the heart of our ability to deter and defend against state adversaries. With Russia conducting an illegal and barbaric war in mainland Europe, it is unsurprising that countries that already work closely with Nato would consider applying to join the alliance and to benefit from its collective security guarantees. We must ensure that Finland and Sweden are integrated into Nato as quickly as possible. She then says she will move that the accession is ratified on a fast-track before parliamentary recess on 21 July without the usual process of ratifying a treaty. She says Using this process will ensure the UK’s part is concluded swiftly and use our example to encourage other Allies to think radically about how quickly they can respectively ratify Sweden and Finland’s accession. All thirty Allies need to ratify the protocols before Finland and Sweden can join the Alliance. I have been pushing my Allied colleagues hard to complete the ratification process as soon as possible. It is important that the UK does everything we can to do likewise. She cites the risk that Finland and/or Sweden could be attacked by Russia prior to them coming under the umbrella of Nato’s collective security, saying: “Russia has already made several threatening comments in the public domain regarding the possibility of Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato.” Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said ahead of her trip to Indonesia that Russia must not be allowed to use the G20 meeting this week as a platform. “It is in the interest of us all to ensure that international law is respected and adhered to. That is the common denominator,” Reuters reports Baerbock said in a statement. “And it is also the reason why we will not simply stand aside and allow Russia to use the meeting as a platform.” Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces destroyed two advanced US-made HIMARS rocket systems and ammunition depots in eastern Ukraine. The ministry said Russia’s armed forces destroyed two launchers for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that America and its allies had been supplying to Ukraine. It also said Russian forces destroyed two ammunition depots storing rockets for the HIMARS near the frontline in a village south of Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. These claims have not been independently verified. Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, said he asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin to help import fuel to his country as it faces its worst economic crisis in seven decades. Rajapaksa tweeted that he had a “productive” telephone call with Putin, while thanking him for “all the support extended by his [government] to overcome the challenges of the past”. Rajapaksa added: I requested an offer of credit support to import fuel to [Sri Lanka] in defeating the current [economic] challenges. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU needs to make emergency plans to prepare for a complete cut-off of Russian gas. The EU chief accused Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, of using energy as a weapon in an address to lawmakers in Strasbourg today. The commission is working on a “European emergency plan” with the first proposals to be presented by the middle of the month, she said. Von der Leyen said: If worst comes to worst, then we have to be prepared. She stressed the importance of having a European overview and coordinated approach “to a potential complete cut-off of Russian gas”. Ukrainian emergency services have released drone footage showing smoke rising above a residential area in the Mykolaiv region. Russia launched a missile attack on Tuesday, hitting homes and infrastructure, including the highway connecting Kherson and Odesa. Some more lines from Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexei Zaitsev, who said US basketball player Brittney Griner may appeal her sentence or apply for clemency once a verdict has been delivered. Griner, one of America’s most decorated women’s basketball players, was detained by Russian authorities in February after it said it discovered vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. Zaitsev said in a briefing: The court must first deliver its verdict, but no one is stopping Brittney Griner from making use of the appeal procedure, and likewise asking for clemency. He added that “attempts to present the case as though the American woman was illegally detained do not stand up to criticism”. Griner made a direct appeal to US president Joe Biden for her freedom in a handwritten letter that was delivered to the White House on Monday, according to her representatives. “I’m terrified I might be here forever,” an excerpt shared by Griner’s representatives with the Guardian said. “I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don’t forget about me and the other American Detainees. Please do all you can to bring us home.” Latvia is to reinstate compulsory military service amid growing tension with Russia in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “The current military system of Latvia has reached its limit. Meanwhile, we have no reason to think that Russia will change its behaviour,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, told reporters on Tuesday. Latvia had scrapped mandatory service a few years after joining the Nato military alliance. Since 2007, the EU member’s military has consisted of career soldiers along with National Guard volunteers who serve in the infantry part-time at weekends. The country of under 2 million people, which borders Belarus and Russia, has only 7,500 active-duty soldiers and National Guard members, backed by 1,500 Nato troops. Russia has denied reports that a Russian-flagged ship is being held and investigated by Turkish authorities in the Black Sea port of Karasu over claims its cargo was stolen from Ukraine. Turkish customs officials acted after Kyiv claimed the Zhibek Zholy was illegally transporting 7,000 tonnes of grain out of Russian-occupied Berdiansk, a Ukrainian port in the south-east of the country. Officials in Karasu said the ship was waiting off port while inquiries were undertaken into the provenance of the shipment. But Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexei Zaitsev, told reporters today that the ship was “undergoing standard procedures”. On Monday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, confirmed that the ship was Russian-flagged, while appearing to muddy the waters while claiming the Kremlin was seeking clarity. Kyiv has accused Russia of stealing grain from occupied Ukrainian territory to sell on the international markets. The country’s grain exports are responsible for almost 15% of the world’s total. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin has witnessed the devastation inflicted by Russian forces in the war-scarred suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin while on a visit to Ukraine to reiterate his country’s solidarity with Kyiv. Martin began his visit today with a trip to Borodianka, where he met the town’s mayor and viewed apartment blocks gutted by fire during the Russian shelling. From there, he visited the site of a mass grave in Bucha on the grounds of the church of St Andrew before travelling to nearby Irpin. After viewing the war-scarred suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin, Martin tweeted that it was “difficult to comprehend the devastation and inhumanity of Russia’s attacks” during its invasion of Ukraine. Martin is due to discuss how Ireland and the EU can support Ukraine in meetings later today. He will restate Ireland’s full backing for continuing sanctions against Russia and for Ukraine’s path to full EU membership. Speaking ahead of his visit to Kyiv, Martin said Ireland would continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing the war in Ukraine. Martin said: The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror. The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes, and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable. The Norwegian government has stepped in to end a strike that had threatened supplies of gas to Britain. The labour dispute had shut down oil and gasfields and was expected to cut Norway’s gas supplies by almost 60% by the weekend. Gassco, Oslo’s state-owned pipeline operator, had even warned that “in a worst-case scenario, deliveries to the UK could stop totally”. Workers demanded a pay increase to handle rising inflation, which has been triggered in part by a jump in oil and gas prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Norwegian government has the power to intervene to end industrial disputes. The country’s labour minister, Marte Mjøs Persen, said: “When the conflict can have such great social consequences for the whole of Europe, I have no choice but to intervene in the conflict.” Gas prices had soared in recent days as the strike action threatened to exacerbate the existing supply crunch, but their rally was halted on Wednesday after the announcement. European nations have been scrambling to fill their gas storage sites before the winter for fear that Russia will cut off supplies altogether. Britain sources about a third of its gas from Norway and the remainder from a combination of the North Sea, other parts of Europe and imports of liquefied natural gas from the rest of the world, including the US. Germany is far more reliant on Russian gas and fears are growing over the knock-on effect of Russia reducing gas supplies. The key Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia into Germany is also scheduled for maintenance from 11-21 July. Read the full article by Alex Lawson here. At least two people have been killed and seven injured after “massive shelling” pummelled the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, officials say. City mayor, Vadim Lyakh, called on residents to evacuate after Russian forces struck a market and a residential area. The governor of the Donetsk region has also urged 350,000 civilians to evacuate in light of an imminent Russian offensive. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that getting people out is necessary to save lives and to enable the Ukrainian army to better defend towns from the Russian advance. Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk said on Wednesday that fighting continues in the villages around Lysychansk. Serhai Haidai said “some settlements have already been under one or another control twice”. He repeated that up to 15,000 civilians remain in Lysychansk and 8,000 in Sievierodonetsk, adding “today’s videos from Lysychansk are painful to watch”. The battle for Sloviansk is likely to be the next key contest in the struggle for Donbas as Russian forces approach within 16km of the Donetsk town, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday. Russian forces from the eastern and western groups of forces are likely now around 16km north of Sloviansk as central and southern groups of forces also pose a threat to the town, according to the latest British intelligence report. The premises of a higher educational institution in the Kyiv region of Kharkiv have been destroyed by Russian fire, according to the governor of the region, Oleh Synyehubov The first rotation of Ukrainian soldiers has arrived in the UK for training, according to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. The training is part of a programme that aims to train up to 10,000 new Ukrainian recruits alongside a £2.3bn military aid package. Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin is in Ukraine today, and has visited the Borodyanka area on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. The Irish prime minister said: “The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror. The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes.” Austria has begun the process of ejecting the Russian energy company Gazprom from its major gas storage facility at Haidach. The US and other allies have called for Russian and Belarusian national governing bodies of sports to be suspended from international sport federations, prompting Russia to describe the move as “Russophobic”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has called on all parties in the world to make efforts to protect international laws as “the world is evolving in a complicated manner”. China is willing to deepen cooperation with Russia within multilateral frameworks including the G20, the Chinese vice-foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, told the Russian ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, has given his daily briefing call to the media. The two key lines that Reuters are reporting out of it are that: He said Japan had taken an “unfriendly” position toward Russia which does not help to develop ties in either trade and economy or the energy sector. The Kremlin had not had substantive contact with the Vatican regarding a potential visit by Pope Francis to Russia. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has issued its daily military operational briefing. It claims, alongside other pro-Russian forces, to have “liberated” 241 settlements, an increment of one on yesterday’s figure. It claims 11 of these settlements were shelled by the Ukrainian armed forces in the last day, causing four civilian deaths and 14 civilian injuries. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia and Syria are the only UN member states to recognise the Donetsk People’s Republic as a legitimate authority. Dmitry Medvedev, a long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has posted a long message to Telegram about the prospect of anybody from Russia facing an international tribunal for their actions in Ukraine. Quoting his own address at the St Petersburg international legal forum, he says: I called crazy any attempts to create tribunals or courts for the so-called investigation of Russia’s actions. These proposals are not only legally void. The idea of punishing the country that has the largest nuclear potential is absurd in itself. And potentially threatens the existence of mankind. He then goes on to ask “who is this daredevil or idiot” calling for these actions, and names the UUS. He then gives a long list of examples of military aggression from the US since the second world war, and says: Vietnam and Korea, Yugoslavia and Iraq, Cuba, Afghanistan and Syria are well aware of how disastrous the consequences of such invasions are – the list is long, and constantly updated. America has killed more than 20 million people in 37 countries since the end of World War II, according to a study published in Global Research. Think about it – more than 20 million! The author of this article, James A Lucas, asks a fair question: how much “9/11” has the US staged in other states? The answer is about 10 thousand. Medvedev is citing this article by Lucas on the website Vox Populi. He finishes: So who is going to give us a show trial? Those who kill people and commit war crimes with impunity, but do not meet real condemnation in the international structures financed by them? Those who so firmly believed in their exclusivity and impunity? Those who believe they have the right to judge others, but be beyond the jurisdiction of any God’s judgment? With Russia, this will not work. Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin is in Ukraine today, and has visited the Borodyanka area on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. PA Media reports that on the 30-minute drive from the railway station, he passed Hostomel airport, where his convoy stopped to observe a demolished bridge. The delegation also drove past bombed-out warehouses, shopping centres and petrol stations. In Borodyanka, Martin met the town’s mayor and viewed apartment blocks gutted by fire during the Russian bombardment. Austria has begun the process of ejecting the Russian energy company Gazprom from its major gas storage facility at Haidach. Reuters reports from Vienna that energy minister Leonore Gewessler told a news conference “If customers do not store, then the capacity must be handed over to others. It is critical infrastructure. We need it now in such a crisis. That is exactly what is happening now in the case of Gazprom and its storage at Haidach.” Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk has said this morning that fighting continues in the villages around Lysychansk. On Telegram, Serhai Haidai said “some settlements have already been under one or another control twice”. He repeated that up to 15,000 civilians remain in Lysychansk and 8,000 in Sievierodonetsk, adding “today’s videos from Lysychansk are painful to watch”. He added: “The Russians are advancing, first of all, due to the fact that they are superior in artillery, with which they destroy cities and defence positions.” Sergei Besov, a Moscow-based printer and artist, has given an interview to Associated Press about his project, Partisan Press, which started making posters saying “No to war” when Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine. He says he felt he couldn’t stay silent. Video of the poster being printed became popular on Instagram, and demand for copies was so great that they were given away for free. After some of his posters were used at a demonstration in Red Square and some people displaying them were arrested, it became clear that the police “would inevitably come to us”, Besov said. They showed up when Besov wasn’t there, charging two of his employees with participating in an unauthorised rally by printing the poster used in it. The case has dragged on for over three months, he said, causing all of them lots of stress over whether they will be penalized and to what extent. Besov has stopped printing the “No to war” posters and went for subtler messages such as “Fear is not an excuse to do nothing.” He considers it important to keep speaking out. “The problem is we don’t know where the lines are drawn,” Besov said. “It is known that they can prosecute you for certain things, but some manage to fly under the radar. Where is this line? It is very bad and really difficult.” The latest status update from Lviv in western Ukraine is that 131 internally displaced people arrived via evacuation train yesterday, and there were two air raid warnings but no strikes. That is according to regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi, who also posted to Telegram that 822 people had been evacuated abroad by train to Przemyśl in Poland. The premises of a higher educational institution in the Kyiv region of Kharkiv have been destroyed by Russian fire, according to a message on Telegram from the governor of the region. Oleh Synyehubov writes: At night, the occupiers launched rocket attacks from the territory of the Russian Federation on the Novobavarskyi, Kyiv, and Osnovyansky districts of Kharkiv. During the day, the occupiers shelled the Izium, Kharkiv, Chuhuiv, and Bohodukhiv districts throughout the region. Residential buildings, open areas, and a wheat field were on fire. During the day, three people were injured in the region among them – a child of one year and 11 months and a 64-year-old man. While the Russian “army” is destroying educational institutions, residential buildings and fields with crops – our defenders are holding their ground. Offensive operations of the Russian Federation are unsuccessful. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has arrived in Kyiv. The Irish prime minister is expected to have a series of meetings designed to reiterate Ireland’s solidarity with the Ukrainian authorities. PA Media quotes him saying: The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror. The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable. The spirit and resolve of the Ukrainian people has inspired us all and Ireland will provide every support for Ukraine’s path to full EU membership, and continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing this war. The Irish State has given €20m (£17.2m) in humanitarian support and assistance to the country, as well as health equipment and medical donations worth more than €4.5m (£3.8m). China is willing to deepen cooperation with Russia within multilateral frameworks including the G20, Chinese vice-foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, told the Russian ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov. China is also willing to strengthen strategic coordination with Russia and expand practical cooperation in various fields, Ma told Denisov in a meeting on Tuesday, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday as as reported by Reuters. Officials met for the World Peace Forum in Beijing where US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, said the greatest threat to the world order is the Russian war in Ukraine. The first rotation of Ukrainian soldiers has arrived in the UK for training, according to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. The training is part of an innovative programme that aims to train up to 10,000 new Ukrainian recruits alongside a £2.3bn military aid package. A statement issued by Wallace reads: The first rotation of Ukrainian soldiers has recently arrived in the UK. Training will take place on military training areas across the North East, South West and South East regions. The training will be conducted by elements from 11 Security Force Assistance Brigade. These Ukrainian soldiers will undertake courses based on the UK’s basic soldier training. This includes weapons training, battlefield first aid, fieldcraft, patrol tactics and training on the Law of Armed Conflict. Each course will last several weeks.” The battle for Sloviansk will likely be the next key contest in the struggle for Donbas as Russian forces approach within 16km of the Donetsk town, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Russian forces from the eastern and western groups of forces are likely now around 16km north of Sloviansk as central and southern groups of forces also pose a threat to the town, according to the latest British intelligence report. There is a realistic possibility that the battle for Sloviansk will be the next key contest in the struggle for the Donbas.” Russia likely continues to consolidate its control over Lysychansk and Luhansk, the report adds. To the north, it has committed most of the remaining available units from the eastern and western groups of forces to the Izium axis. Over the last week, Russian forces have likely advanced up to another 5km down the E40 main road from Izium, in the face of extremely determined Ukrainian resistance.” Daily life in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv rumbles on amid Russia’s invasion. Here, two young women enjoy a moment together as they sit on a wall at sunset. Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has called on all parties in the world to make efforts to protect international laws as “the world is evolving in a complicated manner.” Lavrov was speaking at a meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Bui Thanh Son, in Hanoi on Wednesday. “Vietnam is a key partner (of Russia) in ASEAN...and the two countries’ relations are based on history and their common fight for justice,” Lavrov said at the meeting, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Vietnam and Russia have close ties dating back to the Soviet era and Hanoi has not so far condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine. Lavrov’s visit to Hanoi comes as the two nations mark the tenth anniversary of their “comprehensive strategic partnership”. The Russian foreign minister is due to fly on to Indonesia to attend a meeting of G20 foreign ministers this week. The United States and other allies have called for Russian and Belarusian national governing bodies of sports to be suspended from international sport federations, prompting Russia to describe the move as “Russophobic”. The Russian embassy in the United States described the move as “Russophobic” and said “sports should stay out of politics.” “Using it as an instrument to exert pressure and settle scores directly violates the basic principles of the Olympic movement and is contrary to the spirit of competitiveness as well as healthy competition,” it said. The Russian response came hours after the US State Department issued the joint statement with allies, in which they also urged sports organisations to consider suspending the broadcasting of competitions into Russia and Belarus. Other signatories included Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea. China, India and states in Latin America and Africa were among countries that were not listed as signatories. The joint statement said in cases where sports organisations permit athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete, it should be made clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states. The use of official Russian and Belarusian flags, emblems and anthems should be prohibited, the statement added. Here is a closer look at the battle for Ukraine’s Donbas. Russia concentrated its forces to capture the cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk between May and July, the last two cities in Luhansk province it did not control, through an unrelenting and often untargeted artillery barrage. Ukraine said on Monday it had retreated from Lysychansk, prompting speculation that Russia would now focus on Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to the south, the two main cities in Donetsk province held by Kyiv. The provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk make up Ukraine’s industrial Donbas region. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region has urged 350,000 civilians to evacuate in light of an imminent Russian offensive. The call comes a day after Russian president Vladimir Putin declared victory in seizing the the neighbouring eastern province of Luhansk. It is now widely believed Russia intends to escalate their offensive in Donetsk, prompting authorities to urge more than a quarter-million residents to evacuate. Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said that getting the 350,000 people remaining in Donetsk province out is necessary to save lives and to enable the Ukrainian army to better defend towns from the Russian advance. The destiny of the whole country will be decided by the Donetsk region. Once there are less people, we will be able to concentrate more on our enemy and perform our main tasks.” Another Donetsk city came under sustained bombardment on Tuesday. Mayor Vadim Lyakh said on Facebook that “massive shelling” pummelled Sloviansk and urged residents hours earlier to evacuate, advising them to take cover in shelters. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you as we unpack all the latest news from Ukraine this morning. Here are all the latest lines as of 8am in Kyiv. At least two people have been killed and seven injured after “massive shelling” pummelled the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, officials say. City mayor, Vadim Lyakh, called on residents to evacuate after Russian forces struck a market and a residential area. Ukraine earlier retreated from Lysychansk, prompting speculation that Russia would now focus on Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to the south, the two main cities in Donetsk still held by Ukraine. The governor of Donetsk has urged 350,000 civilians to evacuate as Russian troops escalate their offensive in the region. “The destiny of the whole country will be decided by the Donetsk region,” Pavlo Kyrylenko told reporters. “Once there are less people, we will be able to concentrate more on our enemy and perform our main tasks.” Ukrainian forces have taken up new defensive lines in Donetsk, where they still control major cities, and plan to launch counter-offensives in the south of the country. The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, said the weeks-long battle for Lysychansk had drawn in Russian troops that could have been fighting on other fronts, and had given Ukraine’s forces time to build fortifications in the Donetsk region to make it “harder for the Russians there”. Russian-backed separatists have seized two foreign-flagged ships in the Russian-occupied port city of Mariupol and claimed they are “state property”. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) informed two shipping companies that their vessels were the subject of “forcible appropriation of movable property with forced conversion into state property”. A Russian-flagged ship carrying thousands of tonnes of grain is being held and investigated by Turkish authorities over claims its cargo was stolen from Ukraine. Turkish customs officials acted after Kyiv claimed the Zhibek Zholy was illegally transporting 7,000 tonnes of grain out of Russian-occupied Berdiansk, a Ukrainian port in the south-east of the country. Ukraine has asked Turkey to investigate three additional Russian ships that it alleges transported stolen grain. A 13 June letter seen by Reuters revealed that the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office asked Turkey’s ministry of justice to investigate and provide evidence on three ships that it believes to have allegedly transported stolen grain from occupied Ukrainian territories such as Kherson. The head of the Russian-imposed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, Yevgeny Balitsky, has said the region plans to sell Ukraine’s grain to the Middle East. The main countries involved in the deal were Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain, a charge that Moscow has denied. Russia is planning to launch a railway link between Rostov region and the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk it occupies in eastern Ukraine, Russian state media reports. Building transport links has also been a priority for the Russian occupiers between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and the areas of Kherson which it occupies. The 30 Nato member countries have signed accession protocols for Finland and Sweden, sending the membership bids of the two Nordic countries to allied parliaments for approval. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, urged allies to swiftly ratify and assured the two countries of the alliance’s support in the meantime. Canada became the first country to formally ratify Finland and Sweden’s accession. The UN has documented 270 cases of “arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance” of civilians in parts of Ukraine held by Russian and Russian-backed forces, according to the UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. In a speech at the same session at the UN’s human rights council, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzhaparova accused Russia of kidnappings on a “massive” scale. Latvia will reinstate compulsory military service, its defence minister, Artis Pabriks, announced on Tuesday following growing tension with neighbouring Russia amid Moscow’s war in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-08T17:54:22Z","webTitle":"US lifts UK travel ban; UK consumer confidence lowest since March; Dow hits record – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/nov/08/uk-us-flights-resume-travel-ban-markets-crypto-rally-tesla-musk-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US lifts UK travel ban; UK consumer confidence lowest since March; Dow hits record – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap up..... with today’s main stories: Goodnight. GW The Bank of England will have to act if it sees expectations of higher inflation pushing up wages, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said this afternoon. Days after the BoE surprised the markets by leaving interest rates on hold, Bailey told an online Q&amp;A session that the Bank doesn’t want the recent increase in inflation to become “generalised in the economy.” He also pointed to the risk of more bottlenecks in the economy, especially in demand for labour which could fuel expectations of higher inflation. “And that’s why we would, and will, have to act on interest rates if we see that evidence becoming clear.” More here. Last week, Bailey explained that the Bank wants to see more data showing how ending the UK’s furlough scheme has affected unemployment, and insisted the bank wouldn’t ‘bottle’ a rate rise. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham has been speaking to some of the passengers travelling to the US on BA flight 001 from Heathrow today. Here’s a flavour: Jemmi Fajer, 22, an easyJet flight attendant from Lyon, had planned trips to visit friends in New York city three times during the pandemic in the hope that the rules would change, but had to cancel each time. She said: “I’m so excited to be finally going – just to see old friends, stroll around, see all my favourite neighbourhoods. Jean Berrigan, 72, a retired nurse from Suffolk, described herself as a solo traveller – frustrated during the pandemic – and was heading out for a four-night stay in the US, where she used to work. “I was watching and thought as soon as it opens up, I’m going. I’m so pleased it’s opened up for everyone, families reuniting.” A ticket for the first flight cost more but, she said: “I just thought I’m going regardless – I booked the first flight I could.” More stories here, including Bhavna and Bindiya Patel from south Croydon who were flying to reunite with family, and businessman Nigel Scorey who says technology such as Zoom means he won’t need to travel as much. After a day lacking in drama, the UK stock market has closed with the FTSE 100 down just 3.5 points, or 0.05%, at 7,300 points. Germany’s DAX also dipped a little, while France’s CAC inched up. Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6%, after solid gains on Friday, with hotel groups and banks dropping. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital says: It has been a quiet start to the week following the exciting moves seen in the markets last week. The actions of the Federal Reserve and Bank of England pushed up stocks, and Friday’s US non-farm payrolls report was the icing on the cake. Today, the European session is lacklustre, which is why the DAX, and the FTSE are showing modest gains. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are higher on account of the rally in oil, and that is helping the British market. The Dow Jones has posted a new record high as the House of Representatives passed a $1 trillion infrastructure spending bill, the S&amp;P 500 is up on the session but the sell off in Tesla shares is holding back the index slightly. In other takeover news, cyber security software company McAfee has agreed to be taken over for $14bn by a consortium of investors led by private equity firms Advent International and Permira Advisers. It’s one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year, and the Financial Times have more details: The takeover consortium, which also includes minority investors made up of private equity firm Crosspoint Capital Partners, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, will pay McAfee shareholders $26 a share, a 21 per cent premium to its market price on November 4. As IT departments move on to cloud networks, cyber security companies have grown and received heavy investment from private equity firms with specialist practices dedicated to the technology. If completed as expected in the second half of 2022, the deal will end McAfee’s brief run on public stock markets after private equity owners TPG and Thoma Bravo listed it in October 2020. More here: The British satellite communications company Inmarsat has agreed a $7.3bn (£5.4bn) takeover by the California-based Viasat, becoming the latest UK tech firm to be taken over by a foreign rival. The deal is the latest in which a UK company that plays a key role in Britain’s economy and national security is to be taken over by foreign rivals or private equity firms. Inmarsat was listed on the London Stock Exchange before being taken private two years ago by a consortium including the private equity firm Apax. Viasat, which described the deal as “transformative” for the global communications industry, said it intended to work with the government to continue to invest and grow Inmarsat’s presence in the UK. More here: Back in monetary policy...one Federal Reserve policymaker has suggested today that America’s central bank could lift interest rates twice next year - while another was more dovish. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard said he expects the Fed to raise interest rates twice in 2022 after it wraps up its bond-buying programme by the middle of next year. Bullard, who is generally a hawkish voice, also suggested the Fed could speed up its tapering if needed (it has begun cutting $15bn per month off its $120bn/month bond-buying stimulus, which would see it end next June). He told Fox Business Network: “If inflation is more persistent than we are saying right now, then I think we may have to take a little sooner action in order to keep inflation under control. Asked if the Fed could then raise rates three or four times next year, Bullard said “That is not my base case right now.” Federal Reserve vice chair Richard Clarida took a more cautious approach today, suggesting that the “necessary conditions” to raise the U.S. central bank’s benchmark lending rate from near-zero will probably be in place at the end of next year. Clarida told a symposium on monetary policy that the Fed was “clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates”. Given the progress it is seeking towards mximum employment and price stability, he added: “I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022,” Airline pilot Scott Bateman, who founded the Pilots Together charity, has some interesting observations on today’s flights: The British Airways and Virgin Atlantic A350-1000s which left London together this morning after the US lifted their ban on fully vaccinated international visitors have both now landed in New York. The trip took just over 7 hours, according to FlightRadar24 data, which shows Virgin’s VS3 landing at JFK at 10.51am local time (3.51pm in the UK) and British Airways’ BA001 at 11am EST (4pm UK). Shares in Tesla dropped in early trading in New York, after millions of Twitter users polled by chief executive Elon Musk voted he should sell 10 per cent of his stake in the electric carmaker. But Musk’s unorthodox poll hasn’t caused a rout. After dropping at the open, Tesla’s shares are now down just 2.7% at $1,190, from Friday’s closing price of $1,221, as traders anticipate future stock sales. That would knock around $30bn off Tesla’s market capitalisation (which broke through the $1 trillion mark last month). But it only takes the stock back to levels seen last week, when it hit fresh record highs after surging more than 44% during October. Musk, who is sitting on a paper fortune of more than $338bn in Tesla and Space-X shares, proposed selling 10% of his Tesla shares in order to generate enough money to pay a proposed “billionaires tax” on “unrealised capital gains”. But... Musk did flag back in September that he’d soon have to sell a huge block of options before they expired -- so there are suggestions that the Twitter poll could provide a handy smokescreen. And the whole episode has been criticised by senator Ron Wyden, who is pushing for a billionaires tax. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate finance committee, said yesterday: “Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll. It’s time for the billionaires income tax.” In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The Dow jumped by 188 points, or 0.5%, to 36,516 points at the open. The rally is led by construction equipment maker Caterpillar (+3.8%), financial services groups American Express (+2%) and Visa (+1.5%), chemicals firm Dow Inc (+2%) and chipmaker Intel (+1.6%). Materials, energy, financial stocks and industrials are the best-performing sectors across the market. Investors are in upbeat mood after the US economy added more jobs than expected in last Friday’s non-farm payroll report, and the House of Representatives finally passed a $1tn bill to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. Tightening monetary policy now to fight the surge in inflation across the eurozone would be counterproductive, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane has warned today. Lane pushed back against pressure to take action, after consumer prices inflation hit 4.1% last month - more than double the ECB’s target. In a speech to the ECB Conference on Money Markets, Lane said three temporary factors were pushing up inflation today but are projected to fade over the course of next year. First, the pandemic initially exerted powerful downward pressure on inflation, hitting activity and leading to temporary tax cuts (such as VAT in Germany) which are now being reversed Second, the unexpectedly-strong European and global recovery from the pandemic shock has caused bottlenecks, and mismatches between supply and demand of commodities and manufactured goods Third, energy prices have been the largest single contributor to the currently-high inflation rate. And as Europe is a net importer of energy, that actually pushes down underlying inflation as it depressing the net revenues of European firms and the disposable income of European households. As such, Lane argues there are “solid reasons” to expect inflation to decline through the course of next year. And as it takes time for monetary policy to affect the inflation rate, tightening too early would hurt the economy. As Lane puts it: In particular, an abrupt tightening of monetary policy today would not lower the currently-high inflation rates but would serve to slow down the economy and reduce employment over the next couple of years and thereby reduce medium-term inflation pressure. Given our assessment that the medium-term inflation trajectory remains below our two per cent target, it would be counter-productive to tighten monetary policy at the current juncture. Lane added that it will be crucial to watch wage growth, to deduce the path of underlying inflation. But he also signalled that a one-off jump in pay might not show that inflation was taking off. In particular, a one-off shift in the level of wages as part of the adjustment to a transitory unexpected increase in the price level does not imply a trend shift in the path of underlying inflation. Back in Heathrow, travellers excited to see family and friends for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began have been arriving to fly to the US. Months of pent-up demand triggered a major spike in bookings on Monday, with travellers only required to show official proof of vaccination and a recent, negative viral test. Alice Keane, travelling to Miami to see her sister, told Reuters at London’s Heathrow airport that the resumption of flights was very exciting. I mean, I was meant to go just before Covid happened, and obviously it’s been delayed this long, so it’s really exciting to finally be able to go.” More here. Heads-up: It was UK business output growth that slowed again in October (see earlier post, now updated). Sorry for the confusion, and thanks to kind readers for flagging. Gambling companies are among the heaviest advertisers on radio during “school run” hours when millions of children are in the car, according to research that prompted warnings about their exposure to promotions for the national lottery, online casinos and sports betting. Data shows gambling came second in a list of industries that spend the most to appear on commercial radio between 7am and 8am and from 3pm to 4pm, according to an analysis for the Guardian by market analysis firm Nielsen. The analysts found that gambling accounted for 5% of all spending during school-run hours, with about 1,200 hours of ads airing during those times over the past 12 months. The amount spent on gambling ads was exceeded only by government communications – including Covid-19 messages – and motor supplies. Nielsen does not disclose the actual spending figures because it is commercially sensitive data. Here’s the full story. Workers at two Weetabix factories are launching four-day strikes from today in a dispute over pay and conditions. Members of Unite at the company’s Kettering and Corby factories have been on strike every Tuesday and Wednesday since September over proposed changes to working practices that they claim could leave them up to £5,000 a year worse off. The union claims engineers face cuts to their pay, terms and conditions, describing it as an example of a “fire and rehire” policy and Weetbix’s “corporate greed”, which the company denies. In an escalation of the dispute, strikes are to take place every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. More here: A spokesperson for Weetabix Food Company says the group has plans to mitigate shortages: “We are working hard to minimise disruptions to our operations. We have a naturally resilient supply chain and have robust planning in place to help mitigate any shortages as a result of the strikes,” There could be shortages in the snacks aisle too, after a botched computer upgrade disrupted the world’s biggest crisp factory. Walkers has been forced to prioritise its most popular varieties – including cheese and onion, ready salted and salt and vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits – after the glitch forced it to slow production. A spokesperson said “more niche” varieties had been slowed, explaining: “A recent IT system upgrade has disrupted the supply of some of our products. Our sites are still making crisps and snacks but at a reduced scale. “We’re doing everything we can to increase production and get people’s favourites back on shelves. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.” There’s not much drama in the City so far today, with the FTSE 100 flat and the pound slightly higher after last week’s losses. Cyber-security firm Darktrace is doing its best to provide some excitement, surging 10% this morning after analysts at Berenberg reiterated its ‘buy’ stance after a visit to its headquarters last week. Darktrace had tumbled last week, as the lock-up on insiders selling shares expired. Asset manager Abrdn have jumped 3.4%, after it confirmed it’s in talks to potentially buy Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-largest fund supermarket. A deal could value II at over £1.5bn. It would boost Abrdn’s direct-to-consumer offering, and derail II’s plans to float on the stock market. Travel and hospitality stocks are having a weaker day, though, having surged on Friday after Pfizer announced that its experimental antiviral pill, paxlovid, had cut hospitalisations and deaths from Covid by nearly 90% in a large trial. British Airways parent company IAG is down 2.3%, despite the reopening of the US borders, alongside broadcaster ITV (+2.3%), conference organiser Informa and property developer British Land. Rolls-Royce is expected to announce a major investment this week in its plans to develop small-scale modular nuclear reactors to rival the floundering multi-billion plans for large-scale nuclear plants. The company is expected to confirm that a consortium of investors has agreed to back plans for an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMR) based on the same nuclear technology which propels submarines. The imminent announcement, which was first reported by the BBC, comes after the UK government promised to provide £210m in funding to SMR developers if they could match the funds with private capital as part of the Prime Minister’s ten point Green Plan. Small modular reactors have emerged as an alternative to building large-scale nuclear power plants - such as the 3,200MW Hinkley Point C project - which face enormous construction risks, and are prone to spiralling costs and delays. Rolls’ SMRs are expected to have a generation capacity of 500MW and cost around £2bn each, meaning they should cost less than a tenth of the £20bn each of EDF’s Hinkley project, and its successor plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Here are more details from last month: Here’s the scene at Heathrow airport as the US reopens its borders: Here’s our news story on the resumption of UK flights to the US this morning, as a 20-month ban was lifted. Robert Courts, under-secretary of state for transport, has told the PA news agency that today is a ‘massive moment for the aviation sector’. “It’s about people fundamentally, it’s about getting families back together... “That’s particularly important with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up. “That’s on top of the massive economic benefit that there is from having the United States and Great Britain - these great friends and allies, countries that have so much in common - back in regular contact with each other again.” Hotel group Hilton has seen a jump in bookings since the US announced it would lift travel restrictions for fully vaccinated arrivals today. Simon Vincent, EVP &amp; President, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa at Hilton, says: “Since news broke of the planned reopening of US borders, we’ve seen a surge of interest from European and UK guests planning to visit our US hotels. Hilton search data reveals the extent of that demand, with a 63% increase in digital reservations in the five weeks following the news of plans to ease restrictions. We’ve seen similar trends across Europe, with inbound demand from US guests growing as travel rules have lifted. The reopening of the US border signals the next important phase of recovery for the industry, and we look forward to welcoming a new dawn of international travel.” Today’s report shows that people’s confidence in their household finances is deteriorating, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. Airlines may be in celebratory mood today, but UK consumers are feeling less optimistic. Pessimism about household finances have dragged down consumer confidence for the third month running, as people judge that their financial situation has deteriorated - and is going to get worse. This follows rising inflation, surging gas prices, looming tax increases, growing supply chain problems, and the recent fuel shortages. The latest poll from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that consumer confidence is the lowest since the last Covid-19 lockdown ended this spring. Confidence about household finances over the next year has taken a sharp dive. The survey, conducted during October, shows: Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level since March 2021, down -1.3 points to 109.2 Outlook on household finances continued its five-month freefall, dropping 9.7 points October’s household finances fell by 5.0 points for the second month Expectations for business activity continued to worsen for the second month in a row But business activity reported for October saw largest leap since March 2021 For the second consecutive month, Britons reported a decline in their household finances over the past month. This measure dropped by 5.0 points to 84.6. People are also more pessimistic about their economic outlook. The outlook on household finances slumped to 81.1 – a decline of 9.7 points and the third-largest fall on record. Darren Yaxley, direct of reputation research at YouGov, says there’s a mood of ‘general pessimism’. “October’s index confirms that consumer confidence is on a downwards trajectory, largely propelled by Britons’ concern for their personal finances. The decreases seen for household financial situation over the past 30 days and the coming 12 months are the largest since the start of the pandemic. “While three metrics saw improvements - October’s business activity, and job security for the past month and coming year - the remaining metrics decreased indicating this month’s index is one of general pessimism. This indicates that the last few months of fuel and food shortages paired with rising bills and prices have led Britons to be concerned for the future.” There is one bright note: Despite the end of the government furlough scheme, workers feel more optimistic about their job security in the next 12 months than they did in September. But generally, families are worried about living standards. Kay Neufeld, Head of Forecasting and Thought Leadership, says: “The slump in consumer confidence continued in October, meaning that the YouGov/Cebr Index has erased the gains made since March 2021, when strict lockdown measures were still in place. Consumers judge their financial situation to have deteriorated in October and show even greater pessimism for the year ahead. With inflation expected to exceed 4% before the end of the year and steeply rising energy prices, households are understandably worried about the impact on living standards. On a more positive note, increases in the two job security measures highlight the ongoing resilience of the UK labour market that seems to have coped well with the end of the furlough scheme. However, ongoing shortages of inputs could lead some firms to scale back production in coming months, which would reduce labour demand.” Tesla’s Frankfurt-listed shares are down nearly 6% this morning as investors prepared for the chief executive Elon Musk’s proposed sale of about a tenth of his holdings in the electric carmaker after his Twitter poll. Musk, the world’s richest person, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stock if users of the social media network approved the proposal. The poll attracted more than 3.5m votes and 57.9% of people voted “yes”. Musk had said previously he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes. “I was prepared to accept either outcome,” Musk said, after the voting ended. Market participants expected speculators would try to front-run his selling. Tesla’s stock is currently down over 5% in pre-market trading in New York (although only to its lowest level in a week). British businesses’ output growth has fallen for the sixth month in a row amid a supply chain crisis, energy price rises and a shortages of workers, according to a closely watched survey of big employers [updated]. UK business output growth hit its lowest level since March (during the last national coronavirus lockdown), according to the accountancy firm BDO. Its measure fell from 105.23 points in September to 103.35 points in October. BDO’s manufacturing index dropped two points to 97, nearing the 95 mark, which indicates declining output, while staff shortages prompted a slowdown in growth in the services sector, which dominates the UK economy. “Businesses are facing an increasingly difficult winter,” said Kaley Crossthwaite, a BDO partner, adding: “Between rising inflation and a lack of staff, 2022 could be a difficult year for companies who have been forced to prioritise short-term problems over long-term growth. At the same time, consumers are beginning to see the impact of these shortages, with rising fuel and energy prices, which may in turn lead to cutbacks in discretionary spending. “In the final months of the year, businesses and consumers alike will be hoping that the economy can find some Christmas spirit over November and December and help take us into the new year on a high.” Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, has told Sky News that it’s a big, dramatic day, and a fantastic one for aviation and his own company. But he’s also suggested that travellers may need to rethink behaviour such as day trips abroad, due to the impact on the climate. It’s really lovely to see families reuniting, grandparents meeting grandchildren, people belatedly going on honeymoon, says Weiss, speaking from Heathrow as transatlantic leisure flights resume after 600 days of the US border being shut down for UK nationals. Weiss says this morning’s parallel takeoff with British Airways at 8.50am took a lot of organising. And in a nod to concerns over environmental impact of transatlantic flights, Weiss says both airlines are using A350-1000s, the most fuel-efficient planes in their fleets. The competition will not be who gets their quickest, but rather who gets there on time with the most efficient use of fuel. Looking ahead, Weiss says that demand will be unpredictable for a bit, but Virgin Atlantic is already seeing very strong demand for Christmas, Easter, and next summer. And this week is ‘absolutely full’. Business travel will follow, he insists, despite the boom in video-conferencing tools since the move to homeworking, with signs that small and medium-sized firms are travelling again. Q: But what about the climate damage caused by international travel? Two A350s just took off simultaneously to take passengers to the US, in the middle of the Cop26 talks in Glasgow. What can passengers do to be more environmentally aware? Weiss says aviation ‘needs to do its part’. Airlines have committed to become net-zero by 2050, -- but he admits that’s a long way away. So Virgin is taking steps like using younger planes (68% of its fleets are next-generation jets which are more fuel-efficient). And Weiss suggests that travellers need to be conscious about the issue too, saying: The day trip to Brussels, the day trip to New York may be not the best use of time. But combining leisure and business into a longer trip is the thing to do. And on the pandemic, Weiss says that the successful vaccination development, high vaccination rates and new treatments coming online gives him confidence that we are moving forwards not backwards. It’s a testament to scientists, governments, and the NHS that we are in this position now. There were clear skies and a bright new dawn at London Heathrow for its biggest customers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, who took off simultaneously in a show of extraordinary solidarity on Monday morning, flying west with planes fully loaded with passengers and revenues rolling in as the US finally opened its borders to foreign visitors again. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham, who is aboard BA’s flight, reports. For both airlines, US markets constitute the biggest part of their business – almost 40% for BA, with six flights scheduled today to New York JFK, alone while 10 of 21 Virgin flights taking off today are for America. A few Americans have travelled the transatlantic throughout, and more since August when the UK and EU relaxed restrictions for incoming, quarantined visitors. But it is more than 600 days since the airlines have been able to sell into their biggest market, crucial as they seek to recover from the pandemic. Speaking before the flight, Virgin chief executive Shai Weiss described it as “a tipping point”. Plenty of other flights were taking off from Heathrow Terminal 5 – if roughly half the number of two years ago - but there was only one destination in town. To underline the significance for anyone who missed it, the BA check-in, the cabins and even the air bridge from the gate to the plane festooned with American flags. The planes took to the skies just after 8.50am – using their most fuel-efficient models, A350s, after both airlines having retired their famous 747 jumbos early as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic. BA flight 001 took off on the northern runway, with Virgin flight VS3 rising into the air exactly in parallel. BA chief executive Sean Doyle told passengers over the tannoy: “This is a real moment of celebration. I know how much today means to you – some have not seen your loved ones for two years, others have not been able to do business.” He also told them that flight BA001 was powered by a blend of 35% sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] – the largest mix used yet on a commercial flight, while remaining emissions would be offset, via wind and solar power projects. “In the years ahead,” Doyle said, “we envisage all our long haul flights will be powered by SAFs.” It was a reminder that aviation still has plenty of challenges ahead. For now, though, some optimism has returned. Friends and family were some of the first to book to fill planes this week, the airlines said, with planes across Virgin’s US departures 98% full till Wednesday. Doyle said there had been a significant bookings too from corporate customers and small businesses, giving lie to the idea that business travel was dead. Bankers in particular had booked to fly back, boosting the revenues from premium cabins. But holidaymakers have also filled the front ends of the planes, according to BA Holidays managing director Claire Bentley: “People are upgrading, treating themselves.” City breaks had generally not been sought after during the pandemic, for those who did try to get away despite the testing requirements and travel restrictions, she said. The US east coast’s biggest city has long been its best seller though and is coming back fast: “New York is in a category of its own.” Here’s a picture of the parallel takeoff, via Twitter user Andrew McConnell: And they’re off! The first British Airways and Virgin Atlantic transatlantic flights carrying leisure travellers to the US since the border closures of March 2020 have taken off. As planned, they left Heathrow in a simultaneous departure from parallel runways, heading for New York’s JFK airport. Here’s a video feed from Heathrow of the takeoff.....starting right now.... BA and Virgin’s jets are lined up, ready for their simultaneous takeoff to New York... There are expected to be few if any empty seats on many of the international flights to the US from London, Paris and elsewhere on Monday, and passenger volume is expected to remain high in the coming weeks, Reuters predicts. Bindiya Patel was one of those intending to be on the first New York-bound BA flight leaving Heathrow this morning. Patel, from south London, was so excited at the prospect of being able to finally meet her nephew in New York that she could not sleep. “I think we might just start crying,” she told Reuters on Monday. Airlines, which have warned there will likely be long queues at first, will check vaccination documentation for international travellers as they currently do for COVID-19 test results. Delta said that in the six weeks since the U.S reopening was announced it had seen a 450% increase in international point-of-sale bookings versus the six weeks prior to the announcement, though most experts believe that corporate travel will lag the recovery in leisure travel. More here: Reuters: Travellers head to the United States as flights reopen Sean Doyle, BA’s chief executive, and Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, have put aside their usual rivalry to pose for the cameras at Heathrow today, before their joint take-off. Before today’s flights, both CEOs have spoken about how the resumption of flights was a moment to celebrate. Sean Doyle, BA’s chief executive, said: “We’re setting aside rivalry and for the first time ever, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aircraft will be seen taking off together to mark the vital importance of the transatlantic corridor. “Transatlantic connectivity is vital for the UK’s economic recovery, which is why we’ve been calling for the safe reopening of the UK-US travel corridor for such a long time. We must now look forward with optimism, get trade and tourism back on track, and allow friends and families to connect once again.” Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said: “Today is a time for celebration, not rivalry. The US has been our heartland for more than 37 years and we are simply not Virgin without the Atlantic.” The restrictions lifting today have effectively halted tourism and non-essential travel from 33 countries, including the UK, most of Europe and China, Kevin T. Dugan writes. They separated families and loved ones, with thousands missing out on birthdays, holidays – and in the case of the British tennis star Emma Raducanu’s parents – a US Open final. Now all visitors with a WHO-approved vaccination (which includes AstraZeneca) will be allowed to visit the US. Visitors with passports from any country where fewer than 10% of the country’s population has been vaccinated will also be allowed. Virgin Atlantic say bookings to the US, largely to New York, have surged 600% since the announcement was made. Delta Air Lines’ CEO, Ed Bastian, has predicted an “onslaught of travel all at once”, in November with queues likely at airports. Hotel prices in New York are also returning to normal levels after a summer where discounts abounded. Tourism industry experts expect this surge to last for a while. Tim Hentschel, HotelPlanner’s co-founder and CEO, told the Guardian. “The pent-up demand from overseas to visit the US will remain strong for at least several years.” Some form of travel ban has been in place since the start of 2020, Donald Trump issued the first proclamation that stopped most travellers from China visiting the US – with the list of banned countries quickly expanding. Land crossings from Mexico and Canada were also banned, although there were exemptions for green cards and some work visas. For many, that ban has only worsened the toll of the pandemic, further isolating people as family members fell ill or life teetered on the edge of what was manageable... Here’s the full story. Meanwhile in the cryptocurrency world, bitcoin rallied toward its all-time high on Monday and ether has climbed to a fresh record. Bitcoin is over 6% overnight to reach $66,357, approaching the previous record around $67,000 set on October 20. Ether - which underpins the ethereum network - has risen to a fresh record at a record top of $4,767.55 on Coindesk. Reuters says that “momentum, flows, favourable news and inflation fears” are all lifting crypto assets: Ether is up around 59% since the start of October and bitcoin about 51% as investors have cheered last month’s launch of a U.S. futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund and sought exposure to an asset class sometimes regarded as an inflation hedge. Falling real yields, as traders brace for inflation, adds to the attractiveness of assets such as gold and cryptocurrencies which do not pay a coupon, said Kyle Rodda, analyst at broker IG Markets, adding that the mood in the sector has also been good. “Financial institutions want to be a part of it, regulators don’t want to clamp down on it too much,” he said. “We’re almost past the inflection point, where it’s part of the system and its going to be very, very hard to extricate it.” In recent weeks, Australia’s biggest bank has said it will offer crypto trading to retail customers, Singaporean authorities have sounded positive on the asset class and spillover from a positive mood in stocks has also lent support.

That is up 21% compared with October, but remains 49% down on the pre-pandemic levels of November 2019. Around 3.8 million British nationals visited the US every year prior to the pandemic, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. A survey of 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by travel trade organisation Abta suggested that the US is only behind Spain in the foreign destinations that holidaymakers say they plan to visit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After more than 600 days, flights from the UK to the US are resuming today as the White House lifted its travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international air and land border travelers. In a major boost to the travel sector, thousands of travellers will set off on transatlantic flights from Britain, many for long-awaited reunions with family and friends that haven’t been possible since the pandemic began. To mark the occasion, rival airlines British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will operate a synchronised departure from Heathrow this morning to celebrate the end of the travel ban. Their aircraft will take off from parallel runways at the west London airport at 8.30am before flying to New York JFK, where there could be emotional scenes as people are reunited. Fully vaccinated travellers from dozens of other countries such as Ireland, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe, China, India and South Africa can also enter the US from Monday. The bosses of Virgin and BA said it was a “pivotal moment” for the battered industry, with both airlines having registered enormous losses and shed thousands of staff during 20 months of restricted travel. My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: The transatlantic corridor has in recent years accounted for the majority of Virgin and BA profits, and the airlines said the reopening of the US borders to foreign travellers, announced in late September by the Biden administration, would be a significant boost for the industry. Before the pandemic, 22 million people a year travelled between the two countries, along with 900,000 tonnes of cargo. Vaccinated US visitors have been able to travel to Britain since the summer, when the UK lifted quarantine restrictions, boosting passenger numbers, but the airlines are now increasing schedules and there are full planes this week for the first time. With both airlines deeply damaged by the pandemic – BA’s owner, IAG, is expecting losses of €7.3bn over 2020 and 2021, and Virgin has been on the brink of collapse – the pair will put on a rare show of unity after decades of bitter rivalry. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said it was a “historic event” and “marks a significant moment for the aviation sector”.

The combination of a storm stalled over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe would pull very hot air from Africa northward, leading to a “potentially dangerous heatwave over a large portion of western and central Europe”, forecaster AccuWeather said. In France, temperatures of between 35C and 40C were expected across most of the country except Brittany from Monday, Météo-France said, and were unlikely to fall below 20C overnight. “Even though it will be shortlived, this heatwave could be remarkable for its momentum and intensity,” the forecaster said in a bulletin. France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, warned local authorities, hospitals and retirement homes to be on high alert, noting that last summer’s heatwave resulted in 1,500 more deaths than normal in July and August. Meteorologists in Germany said there was a 50% chance of temperatures hitting 40C, possibly breaking the national record of 40.3C set in Bavaria in 2015. AccuWeather said cities from Madrid to Berlin, including Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt, were likely to experience a “multi-day heatwave” in the first half of the week, with similar temperatures of 32C or above expected further east later in Bucharest, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade and Sofia. “Multiple days of extreme heat combined with warm nights will not allow buildings and homes without air conditioning to cool off, creating uncomfortable sleeping conditions and also raising the risk of heat-related illnesses,” the forecaster’s senior meteorologist, Eric Leister, said. “The elderly and children are most at risk from such ailments, and outdoor exposure should be limited during the hottest times of the day to reduce the risk of illness.” Long-range weather forecasts show summer temperatures throughout July and August are expected to be higher than normal, rivalling those of 2018, which according to the European Environment Agency was one of the three warmest years on record on the continent. Scientists have said last year’s heatwave, which led to increased mortality rates, a dramatic decline in crop yields, the shutdown of nuclear power plants and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was linked to the climate emergency and that extreme climate events are likely to be regular occurrences in the coming decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/dec/08/which-party-has-the-answer-to-the-big-green-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-08T12:58:59Z","webTitle":"Which party has the answer to the big green questions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/08/which-party-has-the-answer-to-the-big-green-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/dec/08/which-party-has-the-answer-to-the-big-green-questions","fields":{"headline":"Which party has the answer to the big green questions?","bodyText":"Putting a tax on meat, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars within a decade and upgrading the energy efficiency of every home in the UK are among the eye-catching green promises from the political parties fighting for voters’ backing in the general election. Others include zero-emission railways and a £640m Nature for Climate fund to restore the natural world and help fight the climate emergency. These pledges are in the answers given to a series of questions put to the main parties by the Guardian to draw them out on specific key issues. There was unanimity on just one of the questions posed: all parties said they would give financial support to rewilding projects to enable the recovery of wildlife. A recent report found populations of the UK’s most important wildlife have plummeted by an average of 60% since 1970. The Conservatives said they would set aside £640m for a Nature for Climate fund, suggesting some of the money would go to rewilding. Labour said it would create 10 new national nature parks and rewild our 10 existing national parks. However, the Tories were isolated on other issues. They alone did not express support for the thousands of young people striking for climate action: “We don’t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion.” Labour backed both the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. “Absolutely,” said a spokeswoman. “This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change.” The Conservatives were also alone in not committing to use planning law to actively support onshore wind and solar farms, saying local people must have the final say on projects. That distinction was reflected in a Friends of the Earth assessment of the political parties published on Friday, in which the Conservatives lagged significantly behind Labour, Greens and Lib Dem on climate and nature issues. Out of 45 possible points, Labour scored 33, the Greens 31, and the Lib Dems 30. The Conservatives scored 5.5. Another difference was the date set for the end of sales of petrol and diesel vehicles, which drive global heating and illegal levels of air pollution. The Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Labour all said 2030, with the Scottish National party saying 2032. The Tories said 2040, but said they are consulting on whether this can be brought forward. On air pollution, clean air zones that ban or charge polluting cars in urban centres were backed by Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. The climate crisis is the biggest issue the UK faces, according to Labour, Lib Dems and Greens, while the Conservatives said it is “one of the biggest issues facing the world”. Flying is one of the toughest sectors in which to cut emissions and the Lib Dems and Greens were clear: they would stop all airports expanding. Labour and the SNP said any expansion must pass climate tests. The Tories mentioned noise and air pollution requirements, but not climate. Slashing UK transport emissions is key to fighting the climate emergency. They have barely fallen since 1990 and make up a third of all carbon pollution. Three parties pledged to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than on roads: the Conservatives, Greens and Lib Dems. Labour said it would reinstate 3,000 municipal bus routes, giving under-25s free bus travel and nationalising the railways. The SNP said it was committed to making Scotland’s railways zero emission by 2035. Houses and business premises produce 40% of emissions and Labour and the Lib Dems say they would spend billions on making every home in the UK more energy efficient, saving households about £500 a year in energy bills. The Tories will focus on 2.2m disadvantaged homes, as well as schools and hospitals. The UK’s electricity emissions have halved since 2010, as coal burning has fallen to near zero. But the parties are split on the need for new nuclear power stations. The Conservatives and Labour say yes, the Greens, Lib Dems and SNP say no. Only the Greens say they would set a date for the last new licenses for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea – 2024. The other parties say they would set up plans to ensure good livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of affected people during the transition to a net zero economy. Labour says its £11bn plan would be funded by a tax on the oil and gas companies. The heavy impact of intensive meat production on the environment has become clear in recent years, and the Greens say they would phase in a tax on meat and dairy products over the next 10 years, with revenues used to help farmers move to more sustainable production. Labour would ask Public Health England to review dietary health guidelines for meat and dairy consumption, while the SNP said it had already set maximum limits for red processed meat in school meals. All parties committed to maintaining food, farming and environmental standards after Brexit, in some cases by simply remaining in the EU (Greens, Lib Dems, SNP). Labour said its new Brexit deal, which would be put to a referendum, would protect the environment. The Conservatives, who back leaving the EU, said: “In all of our future trade negotiations, we guarantee that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.” You can read the full answers on these and other issues here. The Brexit Party did not provide answers to the questions, but directed the Guardian to its “contract with the people”. • This article was amended on 9 December 2019 to remove a reference to Labour being the only party to support Extinction Rebellion and the school strikers. The Green party did also."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-03T05:50:58Z","webTitle":"John Kerry says we can't leave climate emergency to 'neanderthals' in power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/03/john-kerry-says-we-cant-leave-climate-emergency-to-neanderthals-in-power","fields":{"headline":"John Kerry says we can't leave climate emergency to 'neanderthals' in power","bodyText":"The former US secretary of state John Kerry has warned that humanity risks marching off a cliff unless governments take immediate action to fight the climate emergency. In a keynote address to the Global Table food and agriculture conference, Kerry made veiled swipes at the Australian government’s lack of climate and energy policy. He also weighed in on the heated debate about the massive Adani coalmine proposed for north Queensland. “We just can’t sit on our asses and leave the political process to neanderthals who don’t want to believe in the future,” Kerry told the audience in Melbourne. “We have a dearth of leadership, but this will turn.” The former US Democratic presidential candidate said it was not a choice between taking action on the climate emergency and securing jobs and growth. “They are not separate. And anybody who persists in putting forward that notion that you have to make the choice – you can either have jobs plus prosperity or you can protect the environment and the future. That’s a lie. “We’ve got a whole bunch of people running around trying to save the status quo – when the status quo is actually feeding a lot of jobs that don’t make sense.” He said the transition to carbon emission-neutral economies would create better jobs and noted that the fastest growing employment opportunities in the US were for solar power and wind power turbine technicians. He contrasted the growing US solar workforce of 300,000 people with the declining coal workforce of 50,000. Two years ago 75% of new electricity coming online in the US was renewable energy compared with 0.2% coal. “We have to make better choices,” Kerry said. He cast doubt over continued investment in the coal sector, acknowledging the controversy surrounding the Adani coalmine in Australia. “I got to tell you, we should not be moving to coal, we should not be encouraging coal, we should not be building infrastructure around coal,” he said to rousing applause from the audience. He talked up the future of small-generation nuclear power, citing its safe use by the US Navy. But experts have cast doubt on the technology because of cost, technical limitations and its failure to be deployed commercially anywhere in the world. Kerry said people arguing that the cost of action to fight the climate emergency was too great were not factoring in the massive storm and disaster damage bills. In 2017 the category five hurricanes Irma and Maria and the category four hurricane Harvey cost $265bn to clean up. “Wait and see what happens with Dorian,” Kerry said. He likened the money needed for climate action to the scale of the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. The Australian government has resisted calls to invest more cash in the UN’s Green Climate Fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the fund to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s to help those developing nations leapfrog the mistakes and get modern technology,” Kerry said. “We said we would put $100bn in that fund to help these smaller nations do this transition … But do you know how much money is in that fund? Less than $5bn. Come on, folks, that’s not serious.” He compared the global response to “lemmings marching off the cliff into the sea”. Kerry was critical of the Trump administration’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change action pact but said state governors and mayors across the country were stepping up to the plate. The Global Table conference continues until Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/may/23/2020-candidate-john-delaney-pitches-vastly-unusual-climate-change-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-23T15:58:26Z","webTitle":"2020 candidate John Delaney pitches vastly unusual climate change plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/2020-candidate-john-delaney-pitches-vastly-unusual-climate-change-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/may/23/2020-candidate-john-delaney-pitches-vastly-unusual-climate-change-plan","fields":{"headline":"2020 candidate John Delaney pitches vastly unusual climate change plan","bodyText":"The first three Democratic presidential candidates to declare their plans to tackle the climate crisis are focussing on setting deadlines to neutralize US pollution. But one Democrat is proposing something vastly different. Environmental advocates are likely to find it unacceptable, but some experts say it might be necessary. Maryland congressman and long shot 2020 candidate John Delaney wants to scale up technology to capture the carbon dioxide pollution heating the planet, and transport it in pipelines crisscrossing the country. Polluting facilities from America’s industrial regions in the midwest and Gulf South would send their carbon to Texas to be used in oil drilling operations. The federal government would use the money currently going toward fossil fuel subsidies to help fund the effort. He also backs a tax on carbon pollution that he says could cut emissions 91% by mid-century. Environmentalists are likely to oppose the plan because it would allow the continued use of fossil fuels and because it would require a vast network of new pipelines. But Delaney said international science shows humans will have to pull carbon from the atmosphere – in addition to rapidly slowing emissions – to avoid the worst of climate change. “I am as in favor of getting us off fossil fuels as fast as [those critics] are,” he told the Guardian on the phone from the campaign trail in flood-damaged Iowa. “But I also want to solve the climate problem by getting us to net-zero by 2050. And I don’t believe we can get to net zero by 2050 without engaging direct air carbon capture.” He added that the pipelines would be constructed where right-of-way permits have already been approved for existing oil and gas pipelines. Delaney has proposed achieving the vast majority of US pollution reductions with a tax on carbon. The money collected would be returned to Americans who might have to pay more for gasoline, electricity and other goods. That would cut pollution from electricity and transportation. But industries like cement-making would be harder to clean up. Delaney says that’s when carbon capture will be needed. Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice-president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, said the group welcomes creative and ambitious solutions and appreciates Delaney’s “longtime leadership on climate change”. But “while there are elements of his overall climate plan that we support, the proposed carbon throughway would enable continued oil extraction at a time when we need more than ever to transition away from fossil fuels”, she said. “The climate crisis requires that we transform our economy at a pace and scale never seen before in human history, and a network of carbon pipelines that would incentivize more fossil fuel extraction takes us in the wrong direction.” The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has emphasized that the world will need to find ways to absorb carbon pollution, as well as limit it. That could be from increased tree cover and vegetation or with technology to pull it from the atmosphere. Delaney cited a National Academies of Sciences report that found that for climate and economic reasons, direct-air carbon capture will “need to play a significant role in mitigating climate change”. Carbon capture technologies are currently available, but not at the large scale and low cost that would be needed for Delaney’s plan. Demand for captured carbon is low, making it impossible for companies to justify the expense. Delaney would spur demand by having the government pay for captured carbon at auction with money currently used to subsidize the fossil fuels industry. Delaney’s carbon tax would start at $15 a ton of carbon and increase $10 a year. He cosponsored a bill laying out the details with some of the few congressional Republicans seeking climate action. The congressman said he would ask Congress to pass a carbon tax in his first year as president. “It can be passed with every Democrat in Congress and all Republicans who live in coastal states,” he said. “That is the coalition that I think will do the first big thing we need to do on climate in this country.” A handful of presidential contenders have said they would consider a carbon tax if elected, according to responses to the the New York Times. But none of them have made it a central element of their platform yet. Other Democrats who have rolled out climate plans – Washington governor Jay Inslee, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and Colorado senator Michael Bennet – have proposed dates by which to reach net-zero carbon pollution. Inslee aims for 2045 and O’Rourke and Bennet for 2050. Former vice-president Joe Biden’s campaign has pushed back on reports that he might take a moderate approach to climate change that includes natural gas. Many have endorsed a Green New Deal to curb climate change while protecting vulnerable Americans. Some – including Senator Bernie Sanders – have sponsored ambitious climate legislation in the past. Delaney also splits with some environmentalists on another thorny issue – nuclear power. “Let’s put it this way, I’m not anti-nuclear because I don’t think you can be anti-nuclear and pro dealing with climate change,” Delaney said. Nuclear power in the US accounts for about half of the zero-carbon electricity. Delaney wants to invest in smaller, more stable power plants, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/sep/17/retail-sales-fall-august-energy-prices-crunch-supply-chains-ftse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-17T18:24:17Z","webTitle":"British retail sales fall; gas shortage hits UK food; mining stocks and iron ore slides – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/sep/17/retail-sales-fall-august-energy-prices-crunch-supply-chains-ftse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/sep/17/retail-sales-fall-august-energy-prices-crunch-supply-chains-ftse-business-live","fields":{"headline":"British retail sales fall; gas shortage hits UK food; mining stocks and iron ore slides – business live","bodyText":"Right, time to wrap up after a choppy day in which UK retail sales slid, the energy crisis threatened food supplies, US consumer morale remained weak, and markets were hit by growth worries and a slumping iron ore price. Here are today’s stores so far: Goodnight, and have a lovely weekend. GW European stock markets also fell back, with the Stoxx 600 index losing 0.9%. European shares have now posted three weekly drops in a row, having soared to record highs in August. Ouch! After a rough afternoon, the UK’s index of blue-chip shares has ended at its lowest close in almost two months. The FTSE 100 index ended the day down 64 points, or 0.9%, at 6963.6 points - the weakest closing level since 20th July. The slump in the iron ore price hit mining companies hard, with Anglo American (-8%), and BHP Group (-4.8%) leading the fallers, with grocery technology firm Ocado (-3.9%) not far behind. Travel stocks, though, jumped on the prospect of the UK relaxing travel restrictions. IAG gained almost 5%, while holiday firm TUI jumped 6%. Confirmation came just after the market closed… Economic anxiety weighed on the markets today, with UK retail sales falling unexpectedly, US consumer confidence lower than hoped, and eurozone inflation confirmed at a 10-year high. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says it was a good week for travel - but not for commodities producers... “The travel sector has been the week’s big winner with share prices in EasyJet, Jet2, TUI and On the Beach, all enjoying decent gains over the last five days. British Airways owner IAG sat happily at the top of the FTSE 100 gainers as investors speculated that even limited changes to the UK’s travel policy would make a big difference to travellers and the travel sector. But those tailwinds weren’t enough to lift London’s blue-chip index clear of the miners drag as the price of iron ore slumped further today. Steel production in China is down as the country looks to cut back on its carbon emissions. Falling demand leads to falling prices, leads to falling profits, its an equation as old as time and one investors have been wrestling with this week. Bond prices also fell, pushing up the yields on US and UK government debt. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It’s not completely clear what appears to have triggered the change of sentiment, however a bond market selloff hasn’t helped, which has sent UK 5-year gilt yields to their highest levels since March 2020, and 10-year yields to a four-month high. It could be the recent headlines around new fiscal rules from the Chancellor of the Exchequer is exerting upward pressure on short term UK borrowing costs. Another sign of market nervousness: The gloom has darkened on Wall Street too, where the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 215 points, or 0.6%, to 34,535. The tech-focused Nasdaq has now fallen by 1%. Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA says the markets are nervous about the risk of a “nasty shock” at next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, given the risks in the economy. There’s no doubt the downside risks are piling up and are coming from a variety of areas, be it inflation/monetary tightening, Covid, Evergrande, energy prices etc. The list goes on. But then we see US data this week - easing inflation, stronger retail sales and manufacturing activity - and suddenly there’s cause for optimism. I think the risks are too hard to ignore at the moment, especially if the Fed and other central banks are so intent on removing stimulus measures. And it’s not the fact that economies around the world aren’t doing well, or that many of these countries now have high vaccination rates, but there’s so much uncertainty in the months ahead, the timing strikes me as a little odd. The price of iron ore has tumbled below $100 per tonne, as China’s crackdown on polluting industries hits demand hard. Signs that China’s economy has slowed, and the Evergrande property crisis, are also weighing on iron ore (and hitting mining stocks, as flagged earlier). Bloomberg has the details: Iron ore sank below $100 a ton as China’s moves to clean up its heavy-polluting industrial sector spurred a swift and brutal collapse. Prices have more than halved since peaking in May as the world’s biggest steelmaker intensifies production curbs to meet a target for lower volumes this year, and a sharp downturn in China’s property sector hurts demand. Iron ore’s slump makes it one of the worst-performing major commodities and a notable outlier in a broader boom that’s seen aluminum soar to a 13-year high, gas prices jump and coal futures surge to unprecedented levels. A drop back to double-digits for the first time since July last year would be a relief for steel producers, but a blow to the world’s top miners that have enjoyed bumper profits during the first-half rally. It’s bad news too for top iron ore producer Australia, where the key steel-making ingredient generates about 40% of goods exports. The Italian helicopter-maker Leonardo has said it may cancel a planned £1bn investment into UK manufacturing if the government does not choose it to deliver a replacement for the Royal Air Force’s Puma fleet. The Ministry of Defence announced in the spring that it wanted to replace the Puma and eventually three other models. The RAF has used the Puma since the 1970s, and upgraded versions have been used extensively to carry troops in wars including the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan. Leonardo is vying with Airbus, the European aerospace conglomerate, to build a new mid-sized helicopter by about 2025. The Italian company owns the UK’s only helicopter factory, at Yeovil in Somerset, employing 3,000 workers, but Airbus this week pledged to create 400 jobs in a new helicopter production line at its factory in Broughton, north Wales, if it wins the government contract. Nick Whitney, the managing director of Leonardo Helicopters UK, said his company’s existing facility would be able to deliver its AW149 aircraft more quickly, and the contract would unlock a previously unreported foreign direct investment from the Rome-headquartered manufacturer, including more than £500m into Yeovil. Whitney told the Guardian: “If the UK government doesn’t show confidence in the home rotary wing company in the UK, it has to question why our parent company would have to invest in the same volumes,” He was speaking at Defence and Security Equipment International, a controversial arms fair held in London. More here: The pharmaceuticals firm GSK has struck a five-year partnership with King’s College London to use artificial intelligence to develop personalised treatments for cancer by investigating the role played by genetics in the disease. The tie-up, which involves 10 of the drug maker’s artificial intelligence experts working with 10 oncology specialists from King’s across their labs, will use computing to “play chess with cancer”, working out why only a fifth of patients respond well to immuno-oncology treatments. Dr Kim Branson, the global head of artificial intelligence and machine learning at GSK, said only 20% of patients respond well to the new oncology drugs that harness the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Branson explains: “Sometimes it works like a game buster … and it wipes out the cancer. We’d like that to work all the time. This could be transformative,” The partnership will use GSK’s cancer drugs to start with and initially focus on solid cancers such as thoracic malignancies, gastrointestinal and women’s cancers. Branson said: “Hopefully we’ll create a framework that other people can contribute to,” Here’s the full story: Britain’s FTSE 100 has fallen to a seven-week low as mining stocks slide. The blue-chip index has subsided back below the 7,000 point mark, down 39 points or 0.55% at 6988 points - the lowest since late July. Miners are taking a steeper hit from growth worries, and with a stronger dollar pushing down commodity prices. Anglo American is now down 6.6%, BHP Group has shed 4.7% and Rio Tinto has lost 4%, as China’s cuts to steel output continue to hurt the sector. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: Miners are having a shocker after the tumble in iron ore prices – down 8% overnight. A rise in US government bond yields could also worry investors; it could show the markets are preparing for the US Federal Reserve to ease back on its stimulus programme. Just in: US consumer confidence has nudged slightly higher this month after sliding to a near-decade low in August. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index has risen to 71.0 this month, up from 70.3, but weaker than expected. Americans surveyed reported that current economic conditions had deteriorated compared with last month, but they’re slightly more optimistic about the outlook: Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, said: The steep August falloff in consumer sentiment ended in early September, but the small gain still meant that consumers expected the least favorable economic prospects in more than a decade. Just two components posted additional declines: buying attitudes for household durables fell again in early September to a low reached only once before in 1980, and long term economic prospects fell to a decade low. The decline in assessments of buying conditions for homes, vehicles, and household durables left all three near all-time record lows, with the declines due to spontaneous references to high prices. Some observers anticipated that the early August plunge in confidence would quickly disappear since it was driven by emotions. Emotions have long been known to speed responses, the so-called fight or flight response, which was the adaptive function they performed in early August. Many other sources of economic data have since shifted in the same direction, and point toward slower growth in consumer expenditures and purchases of housing to the end of 2021. Back in the markets, stock have opened lower on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 91 points, or 0.25% at 34,660 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq are both down 0.5%. Most sectors are down, with materials producers, technology companies, industrials and real estate the weakest. The closure of two UK fertiliser plants is threatening to create carbon dioxide shortages that could damage the country’s meat supply chain, and also hit supplies of beer and fizzy drinks. CO2 is a byproduct of fertilizer production, so the suspension of two fertiliser plants at Billingham, in County Durham, and Ince in Cheshire this week due to soaring natural gas prices is rippling through the food supply chains. PoliticsHome says the government is bracing itself for supermarkets and restaurants to suffer disruption in the coming days: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was warned on Thursday that shortages of CO2, caused by the closure this week of two major fertilizer plants, would affect manufacturers across food and drink industry, PoliticsHome understands. CO2 is used in the production of beer and fizzy drinks, and is also vital in meat processing. The British Poultry Council’s Richard Griffiths said the gas is used in slaughterhouses, as well as the packaging and chilling of chickens, and warned that the industry was “very rapidly heading into a downward spiral towards supply chains seriously struggling.” He told PoliticsHome: “After five to seven days we’ll start to see significant problems in processing birds.” Back in 2018, Britain’s CO2 stocks ran low, threatening supplies of beer, salads and ready meals, and chicken - as processing plants use CO2 in the slaughter process. The Financial Times flags up that another fertiliser company, Norway’s Yara International, said on Friday it is curbing production at several facilities -- adding to supply worries. The FT adds: Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the government had asked him to gather data on what was a potentially “massive” problem for meat producers. “We are hearing that there are no definite plans to reopen” the plants, he added. Industry groups and processors were told at the emergency meeting late on Thursday that 60 per cent of the UK’s supply of CO2, which is used to stun animals before slaughter, had been cut. They also heard that nuclear power plants and the NHS, which use the gas as a coolant, would take priority in securing what remained, according to two people briefed on the meeting. Industry experts also fear that shortages of fertiliser will hit crop yields, leading to lower supplies and rising prices. A subdued open on Wall Street looms... In the energy sector, Sky are reporting that the owner of the Stanlow oil refinery is facing a fresh financial crunch ahead of a looming deadline to repay hundreds of millions of pounds in deferred taxes. Here’s the story: Sky News has learnt that Essar Oil UK, which has owned the vast industrial site in north-west England for a decade, is grappling with a funding shortfall potentially running to hundreds of millions of pounds. The company is seeking an extension to a ‘Time to Pay’ arrangement struck with HM Revenue &amp; Customs in April in order to secure more breathing space. Whitehall is understood to be monitoring the situation closely given the Stanlow refinery’s key status in the UK’s fuel production.... Pret a Manger is giving cafe workers a 5% pay rise only weeks after ditching paid breaks and attempting to slash bonuses as food and drinks retailers compete for workers. In an email to workers seen by the Guardian, Pret’s UK managing director, Clare Clough, said starting pay for store workers would rise to a minimum of £9.40 an hour, up from the legal minimum of £8.91, but all team members, including managers will get a raise. The unexpected boost for workers comes only a month after Pret told employees it would permanently cease paying for break times, so that someone on an eight-hour shift, including a legally required half-hour break, would receive a pay cut of just over 6% a shift compared with pre-pandemic levels. Pret initially also planned to permanently halve weekly mystery shopper bonuses to 50p an hour during the pandemic but relented after the Guardian revealed the move, prompting a public outcry.... The drop in UK retail sales last month was down to three factors, says Philip Shaw of Investec: First, high street sales growth was very likely to cool at some point. Sales volumes excluding fuel in April were 12.0% above levels two years ago, which was unlikely to be maintained. Even after the recent weak trend, they are still 3.9% firmer. Second, and a related point, there seems to be some substitution of spending on goods by expenditure on services. For example in August, data published by OpenTable indicated a clear increase in activity in restaurants and bars, as the hospitality sector recovered. Today’s numbers also showed a 1.5% increase in petrol sales on the month, broadly hinting at a wider revival in household spending. Third, some spending might be subject to delays by supply chain issues. A study by the ONS suggested that 6.5% of retailers were unable to source required goods, services or materials. This figure rose to 11.1% in the clothing sector and 18.2% in department stores. As such, he thinks sales patterns are shifting towards normalisation, rather than the recovery stalling.... Clive Chalkley, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, fears company insolvencies haven’t peaked yet, after rising last month: The fact that the vast majority of the company insolvency procedures for August 2021 are creditor voluntary liquidations (ones which have been undertaken voluntarily by the directors) is a healthy sign. It indicates that those running insolvent companies are taking a serious, sensible and proactive stance in addressing not only their legal obligations but their responsibility to creditors. However, I would query, in light of the withdrawal of a number of COVID/19 related protections, whether we’ve reached the peak of company insolvencies. Speaking of retail....Next has struck a deal with Gap to run its business in the UK and Ireland, months after the US chain confirmed it was shutting all its high street stores in those countries. Under the terms of the agreement, Next will operate Gap’s online shopping business, host branded Gap concessions in selected retail locations, and offer “extensive” click-and-collect options for online shoppers. Next has about 500 retail stores in the UK and Ireland. The franchise deal will operate as a joint venture, with Next controlling a 51% stake, and shoppers will be able to buy Gap clothing via Next from the beginning of 2022. The agreement allows the US retailer to maintain a presence on British high streets after it announced the closure of 81 stores in the UK and Ireland in June. The closure programme will ultimately result in the loss of about 1,000 jobs, with the last Gap stores shutting at the end of this month. More here: Plus some reaction: The number of companies in England and Wales falling into insolvency has hit its highest level since the first pandemic lockdown. In August 2021 there were 1,348 registered company insolvencies, the highest since the first UK lockdown in March 2020, new figures from The Insolvency Service show. That’s up from 1,094 in July, suggesting that some companies are failing despite the easing of Covid-19 restrictions earlier this year. It include 1,256 Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (where firms proactively wind themselves up) which is the highest level seen in the series since January 2019. There were just 35 compulsory liquidations. For individuals, there 1,714 debt relief orders in England and Wales in August, down on July’s pandemic high. It’s 29% higher than in August 2020 but 12% lower than in August 2019. There were also 614 bankruptcies, the lowest in the series which goes back to January 2019. The Insolvency Service says: While CVL numbers have now returned to pre-pandemic levels, numbers for other insolvency procedures, such as compulsory liquidations for companies and bankruptcies for individuals, remain lower. That’s party due to government support, they add, such as temporary restrictions on the use of statutory demands and certain winding-up petitions, and financial support for companies and individuals. But, restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic preventing businesses serving winding-up petitions against debtors will ease from the end of September, the UK government said last week. Colin Haig, President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, says: “The insolvency figures published today highlight how much tougher the climate is for businesses and individuals than this time last year, and the toll the pandemic has taken on business and personal finances over the last 12 months. “The increase in corporate insolvencies was driven by a rise in Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs). Numbers for this process were 115% higher than this time last year, and 30% higher than in 2019, which suggests that despite the opening up of the economy, there are a number of company directors who are opting to close their businesses after a year and a half of trading in a pandemic. “This comes despite the fact that August was one of the better months for businesses since the start of the pandemic. The lifting of the final restrictions and the continued impact of the vaccine rollout means that more people are working, shopping and spending, and that looks set to continue as we enter the autumn. “However, with the furlough scheme closing at the end of this month, company directors need to be aware of the signs of business distress and seek advice if any of them appear. John Bell, senior partner at Clarke Bell Insolvency Practitioners in Manchester, said: “It is encouraging to see that the vast majority of the company insolvency procedures for August 2021 (93%) are Creditor Voluntary Liquidations – i.e. ones which have been undertaken voluntarily by the directors. This shows that most directors of an insolvent company are being pro-active in dealing with their company’s financial problems with a CVL, and thereby addressing their legal obligations and responsibilities to their creditors. while those who are being passive and just waiting for their company to be forced into Compulsory Liquidation make up only a small proportion of the monthly company insolvencies (3%). The drop in UK retail sales last month highlights the damage that supply chain problems and staffing shortage are causing to small companies. So says Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair Mike Cherry, who warns that SMEs face a difficult winter: “Small firms trying to recover from the pandemic are facing a barrage of hits to this which is now very visible as these latest retail figures show. “Supply chain problems are hitting hard alongside spiralling employment costs and staff shortages, while the consumer-led recovery could be losing steam. “News that the government’s regressive jobs tax will place 50,000 people out of work could not come at a worse time. Retail businesses are nervous about their peak Christmas season, with an opaque winter covid plan likely to see trade restrictions installed at just a week’s notice. It feels to many like a sword of Damocles with a difficult winter ahead. “Exporters, who are among some of the most innovative small firms, need more support, with delays at the border and soaring costs, or risk hampering their efforts to recover. “Measures such as uprating the Employment allowance to support firms struggling with recruitment costs would help to free up cashflow to spur recovery of local communities, and promote hiring as furlough ends.” “Small firms are the backbone of our economy, if they continue to suffer, then the rest of the country suffers.” Europe’s early rally has fizzled out, as investors note that Wall Street is on track for a lower open. The FTSE 100’s now down 15 points, or 0.2%, at 7012 with mining companies still leading the fallers. Shares in travel and aviation businesses including the British Airways owner, IAG, Ryanair and the aero engine maker Rolls-Royce received a boost from news that the UK government is planning to simplify England’s rules for international travel. Investors were buoyed up by the changes – which could include removing dozens of destinations from the 62-country “red list”, the highest alert for international travel requiring 11 nights’ hotel quarantine on return – which are expected to be officially announced by ministers on Friday. Ministers are also considering removing the amber list category of countries entirely, meaning there would be a clearer distinction between “go” and “no-go” destinations.... The British’s public inflation expectations rose last month -- as people respond to signs of rising prices in the shops. The latest Bank of England quarterly survey shows that inflation expectations for the year ahead rose to 2.7% in August, from 2.4% in May. Longer-term inflation expectations rose to 3.0% from 2.7% in May, which is the highest since February 2020, just before the pandemic hit the UK. UK consumer price inflation jumped to 3.2% in August, the highest rate since March 2012, and a record jump from June’s 2%. The Bank’s survey also found that people believe that the economy would end up weaker, rather than stronger, if prices started to rise faster, by a margin of 46% to 13%. Asked what would be ‘best for the economy’ – higher interest rates, lower rates or no change – 25% thought rates should ‘go up’, up from 23% in May. But 12% of respondents thought that interest rates should ‘go down’, up from 11%. 36% thought interest rates should ‘stay where they are’, down from 41%. Fewer people think the Bank of England is ‘doing its job to set interest rates to control inflation’. The net satisfaction balance – the proportion satisfied minus the proportion dissatisfied – dropped to +18%, from +24% in May 2021 and +25% in February 2021. It’s official: inflation across the eurozone has hit its highest level in a decade. Consumer prices jumped by 3% in the year to August, up from 2.2% in July. That’s the highest rate since late 2011, and sharply over the European Central Bank’s 2% target. Statistics body Eurostat’s final data, which confirms its ‘flash’ estimate, shows that energy costs are continuing to drive up the cost of living. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.4%. Energy prices saw the biggest surge, up 15.4% over the last year, while unprocessed food prices are up 3% per year. Industrial goods inflation jumped to 2.6%. Across the region, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland all saw the highest inflation rates, at 5% per year. The ECB has argued that the jump in inflation is temporary, due to the pandemic. It predicted last week that inflation will fall back over the next couple of years, away from its target. But last night, the Financial Times reported that the ECB expects to hit its 2% inflation target by 2025, according to unpublished internal models that suggest it is on course to raise interest rates in just over two years. This would be at least a year earlier than most economists expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate from a record low of minus 0.5 %, the FT says. According to the FT, ECB chief economist Philip Lane told economists at German banks that its “medium-term reference scenario” (usually unpublished), shows inflation rebounding to 2 per cent soon after the end of its three-year forecast period. The ECB has disputed the story, calling it inaccurate, and insisting: “Mr Lane didn’t say in any conversation with analysts that the euro area will reach 2 per cent inflation soon after the end of the ECB’s projection horizon.” Retail sales in Great Britain fell unexpectedly in August amid severe supply chain disruption and as consumers switched more of their spending from supermarkets to pubs and restaurants after the easing of pandemic restrictions. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales dropped by 0.9% in August after a steeper decline of 2.8% in July. While spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, City economists had forecast a rise of 0.5%. According to the latest snapshot, sales of food dipped by 1.2% on the month after the easing of hospitality restrictions had an impact, with people raising their spending on social activities such as eating and drinking in restaurants, pubs and bars. However, sales fell across a broad range of other categories, including a sharp fall in sales at department stores as disruption to supply chains weighed on retailers. Britain’s biggest retailers have warned that stock levels are at their lowest since the 1980s, with the economy coming under growing pressure from shortages of workers and goods because of the fallout from Covid-19 and Brexit..... More here: Britain’s August retail sales drop shows the economy has entered a ‘soft patch’, says The Economist’s Duncan Weldon: The slide in iron ore prices in recent months is quite startling: The rally in travel shares has helped lift stocks higher. The FTSE 100 has gained 27 points, or 0.4%, to 7055 points, while the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 has gained 0.6%. But mining stocks are sliding again, hit by economic slowdown concerns and another sharp fall in iron ore prices this week after China reported a drop in the country’s steel production in August. Holiday-Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels is also benefitting from an upgrade from Berenberg. Berenberg has upgraded its rating on IHG to “buy” from “hold”, raising its price target from 4500p to 5400p. It argues that IHG is well-placed to benefit from the travel recovery, particularly in the Americas and Greater China. IHG are up 102p to 4662p (+2.2%). Shares in airlines and holiday companies have jumped in early trading, following reports that the UK government is poised to ease England’s COVID-19 rules for international travel. British Airways parent company, IAG, has risen 3.8% to the top of the FTSE 100 risers followed by Intercontinental Hotels (+2.5%), the firm behind Holiday Inns, Crowne Plaza. Conference organiser Informa (+2.4%) and catering group Compass (+1.5%) are also rallying. Among smaller companies, holiday operator TUI (+3.9%) and food travel group SSP (+3%) [which runs the Upper Crust and Ritazza outlets] are also stronger. The rally follows a report in The Times that the government will relax its travel rules, following many complaints that onerous rules and red tape have hobbled airlines, holiday and tourism companies. They say: Dozens of countries including Turkey will be removed from the red list banning international travel in time for next month’s half-term as the government relaxes international travel rules. The red list, which prohibits travel to 62 countries, could be halved, meaning that most destinations will be opened up for the fully vaccinated. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is also expected to announce today that the traffic-light system for travel will be simplified by the scrapping of the amber classification. All destinations will be either red or green. The red list requires passengers to pay £2,285 to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 11 nights on their return. Countries on the list include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the Maldives, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Retail sales spending was restrained by the supply chain crisis last month, say several experts. Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, predicts that more retailers will struggle to obtain stock: “Retail sales appear held back by skyrocketing availability problems, due to container prices, labour shortages and inflation. Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, says retailers struggled to keep the shelves filled: “Shoppers and shops were stymied by shortages in August. Keeping the shelves full was a real battle, especially for department stores, which is one reason why we spent less in these stores in August. Supermarkets had a fight on their hands to keep supply chains flowing, but the might of these retailers meant they were able to track down alternative suppliers so we could keep filling our trolleys. Our passion for the big shop dimmed slightly in August, as we rediscovered our passion for a big night out. We spent more in bars and restaurants, and bought 1.2% less in food stores than in July. However, there are signs that life hasn’t entirely returned to normal, and we’re still spending more time raiding the fridge and parking ourselves on the sofa, because we’re still buying 3.4% more in supermarkets than before the pandemic. Given so many of us holidayed at home, and in the rain, this year, it’s not surprising that we splashed the cash in stores like computer retailers and sports equipment shops. Sales here are up 4.5% from before the pandemic. However, there are signs that shortages were an issue here too, because sales were down 1.2% in the month.” Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, says August’s ‘dreary weather’ also kept people off the high street -- and warns we could see shortages at Christmas: “A perfect storm of labour shortages, supply chain issues and increased demand will continue to test retail leaders as we enter the Golden Quarter. Christmas will be impacted by these headwinds; there will very likely be shortages in some categories which will force consumers to make different choices. Retailers – particularly grocers – will have to decide which products to put on the shelves, prioritising higher-margin products where possible. Managing price increases and stock shortages will be one of the main challenges retail leaders will have to address in the coming months.” British retail sales volumes have now fallen for four months running, since surging in April as restrictions on shops were eased. Reuters says it’s the longest losing streak since current records began. British retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell last month in what is now their longest streak of declines since current records began, though sales volumes still remain above pre-pandemic levels, official data showed on Friday. Sales dropped 0.9% on the month in August versus economists’ average forecasts in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.5%, leading to their fourth consecutive monthly decline after previous months were revised lower, the Office for National Statistics said. Here’s their economics correspondent Andy Bruce: Today’s retail sales report also flags up that 6.5% of retailers couldn’t get the materials, goods or services needed from within the UK in the last two weeks. This was a particular problem for department stores (18.2%) and clothing stores (11.1%), amid the supply chain problems that have been grinding away for months. And 22% of food stores had to switch to another supplier, or find ‘alternative solutions’, because of supply chain problems. The 0.9% drop in retail sales in August shows the consumer revival is stalling, says Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Retail sales across Great Britain fell last month, in another sign that the economy cooled over the summer, and as people spent more time eating and drinking in bars and restaurants. Sales volumes fell by 0.9% in August, dashing expectations of a 0.5% rise in sales, and comes after retailers suffered a 2.8% fall in July. It suggest retailers had a tough summer, as the initial surge in demand following the spring reopening faded. New figures just released by the Office for National Statistics shows that spending in food stores fell -- as more people dined out following the easing of lockdown rules. There was also a fall in department store sales, which have now dropped ever month since April 2021, while spending on motor fuel picked up as more people returned to the road. Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, explains: “Sales fell again in August, though not nearly as much as in July and, overall, remained above their pre-pandemic level. “Other data suggest that the drop in food stores’ sales is linked to an increase in eating out following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. “Meanwhile, motor fuel sales increased on the month as people ventured out more, but they remained below pre-pandemic levels.” Here’s the details: Food store sales volumes fell by 1.2% in August 2021, with some evidence to suggest that the further easing of hospitality restrictions had an impact on sales; people increased their social spending such as eating and drinking at restaurants and bars. Non-food stores reported a fall of 1.0% in sales volumes in August 2021, driven by falls in department stores (negative 3.7%) and other stores, such as sports equipment and computer stores (negative 1.2%). Automotive fuel sales volumes rose by 1.5% in August 2021 as people continued to increase their amount of travel; however, they remained 1.2% below their pre-pandemic February 2020 levels. The proportion of retail sales online rose to 27.7% in August 2021 from 27.1% in July, substantially higher than the 19.7% in February 2020 before the pandemic. Compared with a year ago, sales volumes were flat. That still leaves them 4.6% above their pre-pandemic levels. More details and reaction to follow... We’ll also be tracking Europe’s energy price crunch which is threatening to derail the region’s economic recovery. The supply crunch is hitting profits, and forcing some manufacturers to suspend work - including at two UK fertiliser plants.

The risks are clear","bodyText":"The idea that the US might sell state-of-the-art nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, potentially enabling Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reckless regime to build nuclear weapons, sounds so far-fetched as to be almost grotesque. After all the near-hysterical American and Israeli warnings about the risk of Iran, the Saudis’ arch-rival, acquiring the bomb, surely even Donald Trump would balk at such breathtaking – and dangerous – hypocrisy? Apparently not. According to a congressional inquiry, senior White House officials, retired generals and Trump’s close relatives and business cronies have been secretly pursuing a multibillion-dollar scheme to cut a nuclear deal with Riyadh. The talks are said to be continuing, despite increased public scrutiny and legal advice that a technology transfer lacking strict conditions could contravene US law, breach international counter-proliferation safeguards, and fuel a nuclear arms race. The inquiry’s interim findings, published last week by newly empowered Democrats on the House of Representatives’ oversight committee, were based in part on testimony from “multiple” whistleblowers, its authors said. They focus in particular on two high-profile figures – Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East envoy, and General Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Both have featured prominently in Robert Mueller’s almost completed federal probe into the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia. The committee said it would urgently expand its inquiry “to determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump administration are in the national security interests of the US or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially”. The investigation has become “particularly critical because the administration’s efforts to transfer sensitive US nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia appear to be ongoing”. As evidence for its view, the report cited a White House meeting on 12 February this year between Trump and “nuclear power developers” about sharing technology with the Saudis and other regional countries. It also raised a red flag over Kushner’s scheduled visits this week to Middle East capitals, including Riyadh, ostensibly to discuss economic development and Middle East peace. “Experts worry that transferring sensitive US nuclear technology could allow Saudi Arabia to produce nuclear weapons that contribute to the proliferation of nuclear arms throughout an already unstable Middle East,” the report said. It goes on to quote Salman’s 2018 declaration that “without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible”. Despite large oil reserves (and solar and wind power), the Saudis say they need nuclear power. American advocates of nuclear sales argue that if the US does not provide technology, China or Russia will. But effective safeguards are crucial. Barack Obama’s attempt to negotiate a nuclear cooperation deal foundered over the Saudis’ refusal to sign a legally binding pledge eschewing uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing – established pathways to the bomb. The 1954 US atomic energy act also insists prior congressional approval must be obtained for export of potential dual-use technology – in keeping with International Atomic Energy Agency rules. Yet, according to the report, private commercial interests “have been pressing aggressively” to bypass these controls, in concert with Trump associates. “These commercial entities stand to reap billions of dollars.” Discussions have been “shrouded in secrecy”, the report said. But it identified a company, IP3 International, at the centre of the proposal to build dozens of nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia. It said Flynn was employed as an adviser to an IP3 subsidiary and lobbied for the deal when he worked in the White House. Another retired general, Jack Keane, was a co-founder of IP3. He reportedly helped organise the 12 February meeting with Trump. “Another key proponent of this effort was Thomas Barrack, Trump’s personal friend of several decades and the chairman of his inaugural committee,” the report stated. Barrack is reputedly a top Trump fundraiser with extensive contacts in the Gulf. A spokesperson said last week he was involved in the region to pursue “better aligned Middle East and US objectives”. The implications of this as-yet incomplete inquiry are wide-ranging – and grim. The nuclear scheme appears to provide further evidence of attempts to monetise the Trump presidency and of possible conflicts of interest and corruption. If the sale goes ahead, Iran, whose 2015 agreement to limit nuclear activities was repudiated by Trump last year, may refuse to exercise continued self-restraint. Other Middle East countries could follow, ultimately fuelling a nuclear arms race. A clear risk exists that the international counter-proliferation apparatus, already damaged by US-Russian scrapping of arms control treaties, may be further undermined by American double standards. The “nukes-to-Saudi” affair may also help explain why Trump exculpated Salman’s regime over its murder of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and has ignored Saudi atrocities in Yemen and other abuses. As they say in New York business circles, he has skin in the game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/28/australia-news-live-noel-pearson-racism-energy-cost-of-living-chris-bowen-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-policy-politics-indigenous-recognition","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-28T07:01:57Z","webTitle":"Further charges laid against man charged with alleged murder of Cassius Turvey – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/28/australia-news-live-noel-pearson-racism-energy-cost-of-living-chris-bowen-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-policy-politics-indigenous-recognition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/28/australia-news-live-noel-pearson-racism-energy-cost-of-living-chris-bowen-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-policy-politics-indigenous-recognition","fields":{"headline":"Further charges laid against man charged with alleged murder of Cassius Turvey – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Here were the major developments of the day: A an 11-year-old boy has been rescued from a flooded stormwater drain after being sucked 10 metres under the road in Melbourne. Western Australia police have announced further charges have been laid against the 21-year-old Jack Steven James Brearley, who is also been charged over the alleged murder of Cassius Turvey. The man is also facing assault and stealing charges over the 13 October alleged attack. The independent MP Zoe Daniel says she raised concerns directly with the Chinese ambassador about the detained Australian journalist Cheng Lei, particularly the blocking of phone calls to her two young children. In New South Wales, the anti-corruption commissioner overseeing the inquiry that prompted the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation has been given more time to finish her report. Julia Banks, a former Liberal MP, has called the criticisms from her former party about Anthony Albanese’s conduct in question time yesterday a “stunt”, accusing former colleagues of “hypocrisy”. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government would consider “careful interventions” on energy ahead of an estimated 50% increase in electricity prices by 2023-24. And more than half of Australia’s local government areas have been hit by natural disasters this year, the emergency management minister has confirmed. It comes as the prime minister and the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced a joint buyback scheme for Australians living in flood-prone areas. Enjoy your Friday night, we’ll be back first thing tomorrow to do it all again. Study in mice finds bacteria linked to dementia can enter nervous system through nose The potential link between picking your nose or plucking nose hairs and dementia will be part of a new study, AAP reports. Griffith University researchers have shown that the Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria that’s linked to late-onset dementia can enter the central nervous systems of mice through the olfactory nerves of their noses. Prof James St John said mouse brain cells respond to the bacteria by depositing amyloid beta protein, which clumps into plaques disrupting neurons and cells in Alzheimer’s patients. We’re the first to show that Chlamydia pneumoniae can go directly up the nose and into the brain where it can set off pathologies that look like Alzheimer’s disease. We saw this happen in a mouse model, and the evidence is potentially scary for humans as well. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows that viruses and bacteria can bypass the blood barrier by taking a shortcut directly to the brain via the olfactory nerve. St John said the team plans another study to show the same nasal pathway exists in humans, who also have the Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria in their brains. Loss of smell is an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease, he said, so smell tests could potentially help provide an earlier diagnosis. A an 11-year-old boy has been rescued from a flooded stormwater drain after being sucked 10 metres under the road in Melbourne. The boy, who had been riding his bike with a friend on Thursday afternoon in Altona Meadows, was sucked underwater when he accidentally rode across the submerged drain. He was washed about 10 metres under the road before managing to grab a metal grate on the other side, his bike helmet catching so he had time to take hold. A passerby and off-duty SES member rushed to his aid, with police from Williamstown arriving soon after. The SES member removed bolts from the drain’s grate to get to the boy, now fully submerged in the swiftly moving water. A police officer prised the grate open, the boy still clinging to the underside before being pulled to safety. He told rescuers: “I love you all,” later asking about his missing shoes. Partial good weather news! The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting calmer, warmer and drier conditions across eastern Australia tomorrow … ahead of the next weather system, to bring “widespread rain and storms across central Australia on Sunday and eastern Australia from early next week”. The BoM said: South Australia will see showers and storms increase on Sunday. Rain and storms will move into western New South Wales and western Victoria from Sunday afternoon. Gusty to possibly damaging northerly winds are expected across southern and elevated parts of Victoria on Sunday. Rain and thunderstorms will spread across much of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania on Monday with moderate to heavy falls particularly on and west of the ranges in NSW and north-east Victoria. Heavy rainfalls are possible for flood affected areas in NSW, which may prolong or renew riverine flooding. Expect unseasonably cold temperatures for southern and eastern Australia on Monday and Tuesday, eight to 16 degrees below average. Snow may fall in areas of Victoria and NSW as low as 900m, and 600m in Tasmania on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Snow flurries are possible around the NSW Central Tablelands. Articles in the Australian newspaper on Syria referred to AFP A referral has been made to the Australian federal police (AFP) to investigate whether there has been a breach of “national security” in the reporting of the alleged repatriation of Australians held in Syrian detention camps. Articles published in the Australian from early October and today have been referred to the AFP by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet over the potential for a national security breach. The home affairs secretary, Mike Pezzullo, would not say whether the reporting was correct, or confirm a number of women and children were on their way back to Australia, but said the potential for a leak was being investigated. He told a Senate estimates hearing: When operational matters, be they intelligence collection matters, the deployment of our special forces, the deployment of other sensitive operational activities, there might be elements that are true, there might be elements that are completely misleading. The better course is for the relevant agency or department or the most, the most convenient one to make a referral so that the competent investigative authority the Australian Federal Police can make an assessment as to whether indeed, there has been a disclosure of national security information contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. And I think I’m right in saying that such a referral has been made. Pezzullo said the accuracy or not of any reporting was not considered in referrals. The guidance I’ve received clear, very clear direction from government from the prime minister himself, from the minister of home affairs is that in such matters, whether or not the report itself is true, in such matters, operational secrecy is to be respected and preserved at all times. And if there’s a purported breach of that security, then that should be dealt with as a potential crime and therefore, to be investigated by the competent authority, which is the federal police. Pezzullo did confirm a number of Australian women and children remained in Syrian camps. Asked in general about how the situation was being monitored, Pezzullo said Asio remained the primary agency and was working with international partners to monitor what was happening. The conditions on the ground, including the permissiveness or otherwise of our ability to access, physically access, those camps and the autonomous area of northeast Syria has been kept constantly under review. Queensland police officer suspended after domestic violence allegations A Queensland police officer has been suspended from the service following allegations of domestic violence. The 36-year-old male constable was arrested in Canberra and extradited to Queensland. Police charged him with five counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, one count of stalking and two counts of breaching a domestic and family violence order. The police officer appeared in the Southport magistrates court on Friday, where conditional bail was granted. He is expected to appear in the Southport magistrates court on 16 December. SA Liberal party suffers membership data leak The South Australian Liberal party has been hit by a data breach with someone gaining unauthorised access to a number of its membership lists, AAP reports. The party said the material contained the addresses and phone numbers of about 2000 members but no financial details were accessed. It said affected members had been informed directly and expert advice had indicated the information was unlikely to create a risk of serious harm to individuals. “As a party, we take these matters seriously and have reported the matter to the relevant authorities, including police,” the Liberals said in a statement on Friday. Police said the breach was first reported on 25 October. They said detectives had begun an investigation into deception offences. The incident follows major data breaches involving telecommunications company Optus and health insurer Medibank. Report on Great Barrier Reef mission expected ‘quite soon’ The official report of the UN-backed monitoring mission to the Great Barrier Reef is expected to be published by Unesco “quite soon”, according to Australian government officials. Unesco’s report from the 10-day monitoring mission, carried out in March, was expected to be released in April before a meeting of the 21-country World Heritage meeting in July. But that meeting, scheduled to take place in Russia, was cancelled after that country’s invasion of Ukraine. The mission was requested by the former Morrison government after it lobbied members of the committee last year not to place the reef on its list of sites in danger. The monitoring mission was carried out while the reef was suffering its sixth mass coral bleaching event - the first on record to unfold during a usually cooler La Nina year that scientists hoped would give the reef respite from climate heating. James Larsen, deputy secretary in the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, told a senate hearing this afternoon that the government had received a draft of the UN report at the end of July and sent a response on 13 September. He said it was now up to the World Heritage centre in Paris to publish the report, but said he expected that could happen “quite soon”. Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority takes Gunlom case to high court The Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority has filed an application for special leave to the high court of Australia to appeal a decision made by the the supreme court of the Northern Territory. The court found the Director of National Parks (DNP) can’t be prosecuted for offences under section 34 of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989. Under the act, work can’t be carried out on a sacred site without an authority certificate, issued by the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA). The AAPA CEO, Dr Benedict Scambary, said the principles relied on by the supreme court – that the commonwealth and its statutory corporations is presumptively immune from criminal laws of general application – has no place in modern times. The AAPA chair, Bobby Nunggumajbarr, said custodians across the Territory are angry: Our Aboriginal sacred sites and cultural heritage is important to the people of the Northern Territory and the nation. No one should be above the law. All people, all corporations and all government entities, should work with custodians to respect and preserve our sacred sites. BoM boss waves off claims of minimising climate change discussion The Bureau of Meteorology’s chief executive, Andrew Johnson, has waved away questions that he asked staff to cut the coverage of future climate change in a key national climate report. Former and current bureau staff and scientists have criticised the bureau for “cowering in the corner” on climate change, saying that under Johnson’s leadership any public mentions of climate change are tightly controlled. At a senate hearing, senator David Pocock asked Johnson if he had ever asked staff to remove material related to future projections on Australia’s climate from the biennial State of the Climate report. Johnson said: I don’t believe so. I have tried with colleagues at CSIRO to find a place for the core intent of the report that we pay attention to, and pay respect to the future climate issues. On the public criticisms, Johnson claimed there had been “some ill-informed and inaccurate commentary” and said the bureau “largely focusses on the weather” and other agencies and institutions focussed on longer-term climate issues. He said it was his job to “discharge my responsibilities under the Meteorology Act 1955 and climate dimensions for part of that” and said he had done that diligently. Earlier this week, a former bureau chief executive, Rob Vetessy, said that 1955 act needed updating to give the bureau a clearer mandate to work and communicate on climate change. The criticisms of the bureau’s enthusiasm for talking public about climate change came after the agency last week had requested media outlets no longer use the phrase “BoM” to describe the agency. That request, sent out while large parts of regional Victoria was flooding, prompted a rebuke from the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek. On that, Johnson said: With the benefit of hindsight clearly the way we went about giving effect to our intent there will be some significant learnings for us and I’ve apologised in my opening statement to this committee and the community if that’s caused any uncertainty and angst and that’s a sincere apology. Senator criticises government intervention on whistleblower protections Greens senator David Shoebridge has criticised an intervention by the federal government that effectively prevented former army lawyer David McBride from using whistleblower protections to shield himself from prosecution. McBride faced the ACT supreme court on Thursday, hoping to use Australia’s whistleblowing laws to protect himself from prosecution over a leak of documents to the ABC. Those documents were later used as the basis for a 2019 series on alleged special forces’ war crimes in Afghanistan. But in a late intervention, the Commonwealth indicated it would prevent the use of expert evidence in support of McBride’s whistleblower case on the grounds that it would be contrary to the public interest. The prospect of the claim, known as a public interest immunity claim, forced McBride to drop his bid for whistleblower protection. Shoebridge wrote to the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on Friday saying the outcome was a “failure of justice”: While I recognise that the case includes sensitive materials, there are alternative procedures in place to allow you to seek to mitigate these concerns to prevent any sensitive material from becoming public. However none of these actions were taken and the decision was instead taken to prevent any of this material being admitted in the proceedings. The result is Mr McBride’s PID Act claim has now concluded without a substantive merit assessment of his claims. This is unquestionably a failure of justice. Shoebridge has joined calls from the Human Rights Law Centre and others for the Commonwealth to intervene and end the prosecution, much like it did with the case against Bernard Collaery. Western Australia police have just finished a press conference in Perth relating to the alleged murder of 15-year-old schoolboy Cassius Turvey. They announced further charges have been laid against the 21-year-old Jack Steven James Brearley, who is also been charged over the alleged murder. WA police commissioner, Col Blanch told reporters that the man is also facing assault and stealing charges over the 13 October alleged attack, after another boy who was present, aged 13, was allegedly struck with a pole in the face. Blanch: It alleged that the 21-year-old man struck the 13-year-old boy across the face with a metal pole. The circumstance of aggravation relates to the age of the victim and the allegation that the assault occurred in the presence of other children. The young boy was already injured and was walking on crutches with three other boys who were on their way home from Middle View High School in Perth’s north eastern suburbs. Blanch: It’s further alleged that the 21-year-old man stole those crutches. A charge of stealing relates to the theft of the crutches. Blanch said the authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the attack but the nature of the probe was complex with multiple young witnesses. Blanch: The homicide squad investigation is continuing, as is the court process. I want to be very clear, justice for Cassius is my first priority. The investigation is ongoing. I want to be very clear about this. The investigation is ongoing. There may be further charges, but we do have a lot of evidence to be going through and we will continue to do that. Brearley is due to appear in the Stirling Gardens magistrates court on 9 November for the alleged murder. Normal times happening in Victoria. Government says it received briefing on Optus leak before interview, despite telco claims The secretary of the home affairs department has confirmed minister Clare O’Neil had received a briefing from Optus before a 7.30 interview where O’Neil refuted the telco’s claim that the data breach came as a result of a “sophisticated attack”. Optus’s CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin later claimed the minister had been briefed after that interview, but the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, told Senate estimates that the first briefing was given on 24 September - the Saturday before the interview. What the CEO might classify or categorise as a briefing might be different from what I understand it to be but there were officers from her management team speaking in terms I would consider to be providing factual updates to the minister... I have no idea why either the CEO or her management team at Optus would say that. Guardian Australia understands O’Neil was given a further briefing after the interview by Optus, but she has stood by her language used in the interview. Pezzullo says the department would have records of what was said in that interview, and said he would look into it, and declined to respond when asked by Liberal senator James Paterson whether the Optus CEO had misled the public. Key department not consulted on Israeli capital policy shift The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet says it was not consulted about the change in policy regarding the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Katrina Cooper, deputy secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, was asked at a Senate estimates hearing this afternoon what involvement, if any, it had in the profess to revisit the recognition issue. She said it was “a matter handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade”. Asked by the Coalition’s Simon Birmingham whether the department was consulted, Cooper replied: No, senator. Birmingham wanted to know whether normal cabinet consultation processes were followed (ie a cabinet submission was circulated to any relevant departments so that ministers could take any feedback into account): The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, didn’t go into detail: We don’t discuss cabinet processes but I’ve confirmed it was a decision of cabinet. The Senate estimates committee heard a little about the rush to update government talking points after Guardian Australia revealed on Monday last week that the Dfat website had been quietly updated to remove the language recognising West Jerusalem. Craig Chittick, first assistant secretary of the international division at the department, recounted: Following our awareness of the Guardian article … staff from the international division rang Dfat to enquire about changes to the whole-of-government talking points and those were provided by Dfat on the following morning. Chittick said those talking points “reflected the statement the minister for foreign affairs gave to the media on the evening of 17 October, on the Monday night” that the government had not made any change in policy. That comment prompted the following riposte from Birmingham: So on the Tuesday morning you got the talking points that were probably out of date moments after you got them. Chittick added: The foreign minister, as I recall, made a statement after cabinet on the Tuesday and I would think that the talking points would have been updated by Dfat following that statement. Bowen says the energy ministers are “one team” working together to face what he calls the most profound global energy crisis since the 1970s. Russia is the world’s largest energy supplier and that withdrawal from the world market will of course have an impact right around the world and that is what we are seeing being fermented … state and territory ministers agreed today together with me that we will not stand by and watch this flow through to the Australian people without taking action. We have agreed we have levers at our disposal and we intend to carefully, methodically use those levers wherever it puts downward pressure on prices, that we work closely together. He says the transformation to become a renewable economy is “more important than ever” in light of spiking prices – a change of tune from what the opposition leader argued in his budget reply speech yesterday. Bowen: The cheapest form of energy is renewable energy and the faster we get transmission built, the storage belt, the better our country will be and we are all one in that endeavour and we noted collectively, the progress we have made. Tasmania and Victoria and the commonwealth working together and there will be more to come and commonwealth will partner with each state and territory wherever possible in rewiring the nation in the same cooperative spirit. Everything has to be on the table. We have committed to consider all options on stronger action, on stronger regulation as a matter of urgency. The first step was to identify clearly the issue and be upfront with the Australian people about the challenges and pressures. The second step is for the commonwealth to look at all levers at our disposal … the other step is state and territories co-ordinate and consult with each other and the commonwealth and the Australian people need to know that we are one team, on their side, ensuring they are not paying any more for energy than they need to in the face of the most urgent and pressing global energy crisis since the 1970s. Bowen says other agreements were made in relation to hydrogen: The federal budget this week has allocated a good deal of money to ensure the things we have agreed on get implemented including $57.9m to facilitate priority work on the national energy transmission partnership bringing together all the works of the states and territories, the federal government, into one document, the ISP on steroids is what I call it for a drive to a renewable economy with cheaper and cleaner energy. Bowen says the meeting came at a “very important time” and Labor was “clear in the budget” about the pressures on prices: In every single instance, we have been clear about that as well. We have an update from the Australian energy regulator, the security board and they were clear. Energy markets right around the world are of course having an impact in Australia. State energy ministers convene in Melbourne Energy minister Chris Bowen is fronting the media alongside state and territory energy ministers following a meeting in Melbourne. He says an amendment has been made to the national gas law which will allow AEMO – the market operator – to have powers to ensure the supply of gas over “the coming winter and beyond”: This was an issue identified during the height of the crisis a few months ago. We agreed amongst us that this had to change and we authorise the law to change today. New judges for Victoria In Victoria, four new judges have been appointed to the state’s justice system. They include supreme court judge Leslie Taylor, Aine Magee KC, Barbara Myers KC and John Kelly SC – barristers at the Victorian Bar. They’ll be filling the role of retiring judges. Also, 10 new magistrates have also been appointed. Attorney general Jaclyn Symes: I congratulate our new judicial appointees, who each bring diverse experience and a strong commitment to serving the Victorian public. I would also like to thank judges William Stuart, Robert Dyer and Phillip Coish for their significant contributions and dedicated service to the county court of Victoria. Western Australia records 19 Covid deaths in past week Western Australia’s premier, Mark McGowan, has released the state’s weekly Covid update. There have been 19 deaths recorded in the past seven days and there are 3,537 active cases. There are 140 people being treated in hospital with the virus including eight people in ICU. Australian and Israeli PMs have not spoken since Jerusalem decision Anthony Albanese has not spoken directly with Israel’s prime minister,Yair Lapid, since making the decision to revoke the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, officials have told a Senate estimates hearing. The Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, pointed to the strongly worded public criticism by Lapid, and asked whether Albanese had called his Israeli counterpart to apologise for the manner in which last week’s decision was handled. Katrina Cooper, deputy secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said: No, senator, the prime minister has not received any request for a phone call with the Israeli prime minister and nor have we sought one. On Tuesday last week, Albanese’s cabinet signed off on plans to reverse the former prime minister Scott Morrison’s decision in 2018 to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It followed a Guardian Australia story the previous day revealing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had quietly dropped language recognising West Jerusalem from its website, something that initially triggered denials of any change in policy. While Labor had promised in 2018 to undo the Morrison-era move, the cabinet decision ignited tensions with the Israeli government, which summoned the Australian ambassador, Paul Griffiths, to protest the “hasty” reversal. Israel’s election is due to be held on 1 November. Cooper confirmed that Albanese and Lapid had spoken by phone soon after the Albanese government was elected - but the exact matters discussed in that call have not been disclosed. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said she had engaged with the Israeli ambassador about the matter. Many thanks to Natasha May for keeping us up to date today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine afternoon – wearing sunscreen for the first time in a long time. Thanks for your attention today! Hope those of you in Sydney are enjoying the (newsworthy) sunshine and have a great weekend. You’re in the excellent hands of Caitlin Cassidy for the rest of the afternoon. Government working to resolve legal issue of ‘third category’ between citizens and aliens The Labor government is considering how to solve the legal issue of people who fall into a “third category” from the landmark Love and Thoms decision – which left people unable to apply for citizenship, but also not considered “aliens” (in the legal sense). In February 2020, the high court ruled that Aboriginal people cannot be aliens, putting them beyond the reach of the immigration minister’s powers to detain and deport non-citizens. The Morrison government had been appealing the decision, a move which Mark Dreyfus dropped upon taking up the attorney general’s mantle. But to date, there has been no solution for the 18 or so people caught up in the decision. They cannot be deported, but they are also without visa rights, meaning they don’t have work rights, leaving them in limbo. The Greens senator Nick McKim questioned home affairs officials over the status of the people caught up in the decision and whether or not the government was considering a fix, including changing legislation. Murray Watt, the minister representing Clare O’Neil in estimates (house ministers are always represented by Senate ministers in Senate estimates) said he didn’t have the detail, but work was underway. Obviously, as the representing minister, I’m not fully across the details of this, but I can only agree with what the [home affairs] secretary has said, which is that this is something that is under consideration by the government. I don’t have a timeframe for that, but it’s under consideration. National responses have not kept pace with listing of threatened species, biodiversity conservation head says Cassandra Kennedy, the department’s division head of biodiversity conservation, said the new environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, “has a much more ambitious agenda in terms of reform of the EPBC Act”. Rather than continuing on with the public consultation and reconsideration around those recovery plans for those tranches, that is now part of a broader process looking at how we can do that conservation planning better. Peter Whish-Wilson asked whether this signalled an end to the general trend of moving away from recovery plans seen under the previous government. Kennedy responded that more species were being listed for protection every year and that conservation responses under national laws had not kept pace with this. This sounds like a signal that we will see some further changes in this area but the government is considering its direction through the law reform process. Something to watch for when Plibersek delivers her response to the Samuel review before the end of the year. Federal government halts process that could have scrapped recovery plans for hundreds of threatened species The Albanese government has hit pause on a process commenced by the previous government that was reconsidering recovery plan requirements for more than 600 threatened species. You might remember Guardian Australia revealed in June that one of the last acts of the former environment minister, Sussan Ley, was to scrap recovery plan requirements for 176 listed plants, animals and ecological communities. That decision followed a public consultation process, with the scrapped plans for the 176 just the first of three proposed tranches. A total of 676 plants, animals and communities were to have their legislated requirement for a recovery plan reconsidered. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked about this today. Earlier this morning the Tasmanian senator wanted to know whether the new government would reconsider Ley’s decision to scrap the recovery plan requirement for the endangered Tasmanian Devil. We didn’t quite get an answer to that but later in the session Whish-Wilson asked for an update on the process as a whole and whether the Albanese government planned to conduct public consultation for the remainder of the 676 plans that had been under review. Officials told the hearing the government was taking a different course, with recovery planning now being considered as part of its response to Graeme Samuel’s review of The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Greens welcome NSW decision on Glendell coal mine We brought you the news on the blog earlier that the Independent Planning Commission had refused Glencore’s proposal to expand its Glendell coal mine in the Hunter Valley. The Greens senator for NSW David Shoebridge has welcomed the decision, saying “all credit goes to the amazing work of the Wonnarua Traditional Owners”. The independent MP Zoe Daniel says she raised concerns directly with the Chinese ambassador about the detained Australian journalist Cheng Lei, particularly the blocking of phone calls to her two young children. The member for the Victorian seat of Goldstein sent a statement to Guardian Australia today in response to questions about her meeting with China’s ambassador, Xiao Qian. (Daniel posted an image of the meeting to her Facebook page this week, as did the Chinese embassy.) Daniel said: I met the Chinese Ambassador this week at his invitation. Our discussions encompassed the various differences between our two countries as well as areas where we might be able to find common ground. I reiterated concerns already expressed to the Embassy about the plight of the Australian citizen Cheng Lei, particularly about her inability to communicate with her two young children in Melbourne. I thanked the Ambassador for the invitation to meet and passed on greetings from the Goldstein Chinese community. The former and current Australian governments have accused China of a lack of transparency regarding the national security-related accusations against Cheng, who was detained in China more than two years ago. In September, Xiao told the ABC he was “trying to see” if he could help facilitate access between Cheng and her family “based on humanitarian considerations”. Xiao has been active in meeting politicians, political figures, business figures and academics since arriving in Australia at the beginning of the year. A search of the Chinese embassy websites shows that he has also met with the Coalition’s spokesperson on foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, the Labor party’s national secretary, Paul Erickson, and the former prime ministers John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating since June. Keating has been outspoken in criticising the Australian government’s China policies – but Turnbull was the prime minister who brought in tough new laws against foreign interference and espionage that he publicly linked to concerns about China’s activities in Australia. The NSW Independent Planning Commission has today refused Glencore’s proposed extension to its Hunter Valley Glendell coal mine. The commission found that the project “is not in the public interest, despite its likely benefits” as the mine would have “significant, irreversible and unjustified impacts on the historic heritage values of the Ravensworth Homestead complex”. The complex, including the main house built in 1832, would have needed to be relocated for the project to proceed. The project would also harm Aboriginal cultural heritage values, the commission said. The Plains Clan of the Wonnarua People describe the Ravensworth Homestead and surrounding land as “hallowed ground” of the Wonnarua people as it was the site of a series of massacres from the 1820s onwards. Maria Foot, a member of the local Wonnarua clan, told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2021 that the relocation would have been tantamount to “moving a graveyard”. However, the mining company had previously contested the location and date of the massacres. The commission heard evidence from a wide range of stakeholders, including Glencore, the Department of Planning and Environment, Heritage NSW, the NSW Heritage Council, Singleton council and representatives from local Aboriginal groups, as well as conducting a site inspection and holding a public hearing in March this year. In its Statement of Reasons for Decision, the commission found that the Ravensworth Homestead complex, comprised of colonial buildings and gardens and located approximately in the centre of the proposed mine site, has “high to exceptional heritage value” in its existing historic location and setting. The commission said: The removal of the Ravensworth Homestead complex and associated heritage from the Site would constitute a significant loss to future generations. It acknowledged the positive employment, economic and social benefits the project would bring but said that the heritage impacts meant the project “is not in the public interest.” The commission found that greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and biodiversity impacts, could have been appropriately managed in the event that the significant and irreversible impacts to historic heritage could have been avoided. Thomson Dam spilling for the first time in 26 years The Thomson dam in Victoria’s West Gippsland, which holds half of Melbourne’s water supply, has spilled for the first time since 1996. Thomson is the third-biggest reservoir supplying a major city behind Warragamba and Wivenhoe. The size of two Sydney Harbours, when it was officially added to Melbourne’s water storage system in 1984 it more than doubled the city’s storage capacity overnight. It’s been full three times before now: 1992, 1993 and 1996. River Murray communities warned to prepare for flooding NSW SES issued two advice messages for the upper and lower River Murray areas. A highly pathogenic and aggressive worm that targets fruit and vegetable crops has been detected in the Northern Territory, AAP reports. Biosecurity officers found the invasive microscopic roundworm – known as guava root-knot nematode – in four Top End areas, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade said today. Test results from horticulture properties in Middle Point, Jingili, Palmerston and Malak suggest the parasite could have arrived in the Darwin area about a year ago. Biosecurity staff have started working with infected properties and the agriculture sector to stop its spread, but it will be tough to eradicate. The pest was found on sweet potato, cucumber, capsicum, butternut pumpkin, snake bean, zucchini and chilli plants. Investigators have not found a link between the infected properties and testing continues to find out if the worm, which has a scientific name of Meloidogyne enterolobii, has contaminated other areas in the NT. It spreads in soil attached to machinery, tools, footwear and plant products, and affects crop yield of several vegetables, fruit and agricultural fibres. Infected plants can be identified by several symptoms including stunted growth, wilting, yellow leaves and deformation. There were 4,447 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and two people are in intensive care. Julia Banks, the former Liberal MP, has savaged as a “stunt” the criticisms from her former party about Anthony Albanese’s conduct in question time yesterday, accusing former colleagues of “hypocrisy”. Coalition MPs have continued their attacks on the prime minister today, after the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, was said to have left the parliament “in tears” following Albanese’s response to her question yesterday afternoon. Landry claimed it was “bullying”; Albanese repeatedly denied the allegation this morning, saying he was yelling in the direction of opposition leader Peter Dutton, who was interjecting. The speaker of the house, Labor MP Milton Dick, said he did not believe the PM had been disrespectful. Banks, the former Liberal member for Chisholm, left the party after Scott Morrison’s unseating of former PM Malcolm Turnbull in 2018. She moved to the crossbench and made public claims about bullying and intimidation inside the Coalition. On Friday, Banks tweeted a photo of Landry with a number of Coalition women who attended a press conference to criticise Albanese. Banks tweeted: A political performance stunt of faux outrage, reeking of hypocrisy. More a reminder of their usual group behaviour of being complicit to the patriarchy. At his Sydney press conference earlier, Albanese told journalists to “look at the footage” of the question time exchange with Landry, pointing out that she was laughing during an earlier part of his answer. ‘Too late to leave’ flood warning for Barmah and Lower Moira Victorian emergency services have delivered a flood warning at midday for residents of Barmah and Lower Moira that it is too late to leave the area. Greens MP ejected from Queensland parliament for koala interjection The Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy MacMahon, has been ejected from the chamber of Queensland parliament for the entire day following a fiery interjection during the premier’s speech. Annastacia Palaszczuk was about to announce that Queensland’s new fossil emblem would be the Muttaburrasaurus langdoni, which was discovered by Doug Langdon in Muttaburra in central Queensland. Palaszczuk then mentioned one of the state’s emblems, the koala, when MacMahon screamed out angrily from the back of the chamber that “koala habitat is being cleared right now in Deebing Creek”. Palaszczuk retorted that the Greens were “all talk and no action” before the speaker, Curtis Pitt, warned MacMahon about the interruption and said she should direct comments through the chair. MacMahon rose again to explain the interjections, prompting the speaker to order her to leave the chamber for an hour, later advising MacMahon would not be permitted from returning for the entire day. The speaker explained MPs could not use “personal explanations” to talk about issues on their agendas. First Nations people consider the Deebing Creek Mission site, west of Ipswich, to be culturally significant and have fought to protect the land from development, as they believe it harbours the unmarked remains of ancestors. In Senate estimates Labor is investigating the alleged leak of cabinet material to the authors of Plagued, the book by Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers. The book reveals details from the National Security Committee of the Morrison government’s cabinet, including its approach to dealing with China, the decision-making process behind closing Australia’s borders in early 2020, and discussions around Australia’s defence posture. The first assistant secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PMC), John Reid, said: We’ve reviewed the book and what information is in it, to determine its accuracy or otherwise. We’ve referred that information to the attorney general’s department ... Our conclusions were it certainly appears to reveal information that was, until it was revealed, cabinet material, and would ordinarily have been protected under the principle of cabinet confidentiality. Reid said he was “not aware” if other agencies are investigating the matter, but explained it had been referred to the attorney general’s department because it administers the “relevant criminal provisions” relating to disclosure of protected information. Reid said: Any action taken in relation to this would be within their purview. Asked if PMC would cooperate with any criminal investigation, he said “absolutely”. We’ll see, when AGD [attorney general’s department] and Australian federal police officials are up at estimates, whether a referral has been made. Funding for saving native species program ‘not enough’: Hanson-Young A little more from environment estimates where senators have been asking about the level of funding for conservation work. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, has said the government is taking the decline of the country’s wildlife seriously but the challenge is unlikely to be addressed through public funding alone. She said this was why creating a new biodiversity market had been such a focus for the new government. You might recall the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, announced the scheme in August, describing its potential as a “green Wall Street”. The government seems to have moved on from that framing, with McAllister now referring to the proposed scheme as “the nature repair market”. The scheme remains under development, with the minister working through key issues identified through recent public consultation. McAllister said the government “will use every tool in our kit to get to our objective” of no new extinctions. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the point being raised by senators was that $224.5m in funding for a saving native species program (about $56m per year), “is not enough”. McAllister responded: There are a range of tools available to government and we’re determined to use all of them. She said there were “resource constraints on the budget” but the government was working on “rebuilding capability in a part of government that was not (made) a priority by the previous Liberal National party government”. ‘We will have to do more’ on energy prices, treasurer says Finally, Jim Chalmers is asked about energy prices, due to rise in the coming two years as forecast in the budget. He says what we are seeing is “absolutely caused by the war in Ukraine” and the government has been frank with the public about what’s to come. Right around the world, countries are dealing with some skyrocketing power prices and unfortunately, we are no exception to that … [The energy] minister Chris Bowen has done a lot of work already with the state and territory counterparts in the budget. I funded and empowered the regulators to do more in this area but we’ve levelled with people and said that our expectation is that we will have to do more here. PM says he was responding to Peter Dutton in question time, not Michelle Landry Albanese is asked about accusations of bullying during question time from Coalition MP Michelle Landry. Landry fronted the media with a group of women who, incidentally, didn’t attend the national march for justice. He asks the reporter to take a look at the footage themselves. Peter Dutton was interjecting, I had the exchange with Peter Dutton … He was interjecting and yelling across the chamber as he does … every time I get asked a question by those opposite. I responded because he didn’t seem to know the difference of where Rockhampton roads were given the question was about Rockhampton roads. Albanese on repatriations from Syria: ‘We will always act in a way that keeps Australians safe’ Albanese is asked about the women and children, including sick and vulnerable individuals, to be repatriated from Syrian detention camps. The opposition leader called this a “national security risk”. Albanese says the party will continue to act on the advice of national security “which is what we have done up to this point and what the former government did as well”. We will always act in a way that keeps Australians safe … The former government did bring back some children from that area … and I’d say to my parliamentary colleagues who are aware of the national security implications here, of information being in the public arena, that the national security agencies would prefer to remain out of the public domain at this point in time. I don’t intend to add to it. Now to questions. Albanese is asked about Cassius Turvey, the fifteen-year-old Indigenous boy killed in an alleged violent attack in Perth. He says it is a “terrible tragedy”. This attack that was clearly racially motivated just breaks your heart, we are a better country than that and my heart goes out to the family and the friends. Albanese turns to the new initiatives in the budget, primarily on housing and the housing Australia Future Fund to build 30,000 social and affordable housing units, as well as $100m for emergency housing and women escaping domestic violence. We had the increased funding for remote housing for Indigenous Australians and we had the development of a national homelessness strategy and a housing supply and affordability council being created. But one of the things that I said during the election campaign and I’ve said since, it’s important not just what you do but how you do it. He says Labor is prepared to work with state and local governments as well as local industry and investment funds. Anthony Albanese says budget ‘was right for the times’ The prime minister is up and he sure brought the weather with him! What a sunny day we’re having in Sydney. He thanks Chalmers for handing down his first budget and says it’s “great to be here” in Parramatta with “our friend Andrew Charlton”, the local member. This is Albanese’s first time back in Parramatta since the election. Tuesday’s budget was about implementing our future. We went through the commitments that we gave to the people of Australia in May and have ensured that we delivered on them. From the youngest Australians receiving support through childcare, from families getting support with increase paid parental leave to businesses and new industries getting support through our national reconstruction fund, to people being able to connect with each other in the world through the upgraded national broadband network, through to our investment in productivity boosting infrastructure right through to looking after Australians who are on aged care plans. And our plans, of course, to get wages moving again. This was a budget that was right for the times, it was responsible … 99% in the first two years, of the revenue gains that have been received by the increased prices that are out there, we returned to the budget’s bottom line. Because we understand that responsible economic management means fighting inflation. Housing package aimed at communities like western Sydney, Chalmers says Chalmers says global pressures are felt “most acutely around the kitchen table”. That is why the budget that we handed down this week was all about responsible cost of living relief, all about investing in the drivers of growth and investing in our people and it was all also about repairing the economy so that we can spend less money on waste and rorts and more money on priorities. Turning to housing, Chalmers says gaps in supply and rising rental prices will be a government focus, and western Sydney is “in so many ways” the epicentre of Australia’s housing challenge. Here in western Sydney, we’ve got very low vacancy rates, fast rising rents and a large proportion of communities like this are renters and … every 10th worker in western Sydney works in construction. He says western Sydney was the “sort of community that we had in mind” when putting together the government’s housing package. Rates are low and rents are higher, it’s harder and harder for people to live near where job opportunities are. So what we have done is we’ve brought together superannuation and and other investors, state and local government and the building industry to do something meaningful about affordable housing. The lack of affordable rental properties is one of the big challenges that we have in our economy … The budget was the beginning of laying the foundations for a better future, the budget was all about making our economy more resilient and our budget more responsible. It was an important start … The hard work has begun. Treasurer to meet local employers in western Sydney amid economic challenges The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is appearing in front of the media now in Parramatta, in western Sydney. He says he will be spending time in the area today talking with local employers about the challenges western Sydney’s economy is facing. We recognise that if we want the Australian economy to be stronger and more modern and resilient, we need local economies to be stronger, more modern and more resilient as well. Turning to the budget, he says it was “responsible, right for the times and … readies us for a better future”. In uncertain global conditions it recognises that the best defence we have is a responsible budget here at home. The ACT has provided its weekly Covid update. There have been 731 new cases in the past week, and no lives lost to the virus. There are 43 people being treated in hospital with Covid-19 including one person requiring intensive care. David Pocock questions whether proposed $225m spending to stop new extinctions is adequate In environment estimates this morning, the government has been asked a lot of questions about whether it has provided enough funding to achieve its goal of zero new extinctions. The independent senator David Pocock asked if the Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water had done any modelling to calculate how much funding would be needed to reach this target. The answer to that question was no. However, later in the session, the threatened species commissioner, Fiona Fraser, acknowledged an academic paper led by scientist Brendan Wintle. That 2019 paper found it would take $1.7bn annually to recover all of Australia’s threatened species. The scientists have since increased that figure to $2bn due to the catastrophic black summer bushfires. The budget has allocated a fraction of this: $224.5m over the forward estimates for a saving native species program. We hear that $100m of that $224.5m is redirected funding from money allocated to the environment portfolio by the previous government’s budget in March. Officials told the hearing a portion of the $1.1bn for the natural heritage trust would also be directed toward conservation programs. Pocock asked if the government was spending enough: Do you accept that $225m over four years is significantly less than what some of our most eminent scientists have calculated is necessary to deliver on a commitment for no new extinctions? Jenny McAllister, the assistant minister for climate change and energy, said the new environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, had “been very clear that the scale of the challenge before us is immense”: She has also indicated that it is unlikely to be met exclusively by public funding. The anti-corruption commissioner overseeing the inquiry that prompted the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation has been given more time to finish her report, AAP reports. Ruth McColl SC had been due to depart the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption at the end of October but the integrity agency on Friday said it still needed her work. Icac said in a statement today: Ms McColl’s services are required for the purpose of her finalising the Operation Keppel report, including participating in the review and editing process of that report. McColl was appointed in July 2020 to oversee Operation Keppel, which began as an investigation into Berejiklian’s former partner, former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire, over his use of public office for private gain. But when the then premier sensationally revealed their clandestine relationship, it sparked a further investigation into her conduct. Berejiklian, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned as premier in October 2021 and now works for Optus. No ‘knee-jerk reactions’ on energy interventions: energy minister The NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, has said he’s going to use today’s meeting with Bowen to demand relief for households, following his criticism of the lack of cost of living support in the budget. ABC Radio asked Bowen if he will have anything to offer Kean. Bowen said: We’ve got to make sure all our actions are complimentary at the start point, commonwealth going off and doing something if it’s contradicted by something the state does and vice versa. We’ve agreed to keep in close contact in relation to particular ideas. As I said, one of our policy objectives at the federal level is to ensure that anything we do is working in tandem with Reserve Bank’s concerns about the economy. I want to deal with the causes not symptoms, if at all possible. I think that is a key criteria for us – careful consideration of what is causing these elevated prices – is the best way. Asked about the timing of whether any mechanism decided on could be implemented within weeks, Bowen said: Not a day longer than it would take for us to be sure that the policy settings are right and not a day earlier than we need to ensure that the policy settings are right. We’re working on this at a considerable pace. But under this government, you don’t have sort of knee-jerk reactions. Twenty per cent of energy price rise ‘already baked in’, Bowen says Will government intervention stave off the energy costs expected to hit Australians, or is the 50% energy price rise inevitable? Bowen: 20% of it is already occurring, that was the price rise at the previous government before the election – by changing the law to delay the the annual reporting of the default market offer – and so that’s that’s already baked in. However, he acknowledges “those pressures are continuing” and the collaboration between state and federal governments will continue to try to bring down energy costs with both short- and long-term measures. We’re working very closely on those medium- and longer-term trend changes [and] transitions … those big investments, but we’ll continue to talk about short term as well because there’s a role for all governments and the most important thing for us to ensure is that our actions are working in tandem and complimentary to each other. In the budget this week, the government estimated a 50% increase in electricity prices by 2023-24. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, spoke to ABC radio this morning ahead of a meeting of state and federal energy ministers today. He spoke about the global pressures, including the decision of Vladimir Putin to “weaponise energy prices”, and confirmed the meeting would be considering interventions in the market as a short-term measure. I like to look at this in two ways. There’s a medium and longer term in which, of course, the obvious course of action is to continue with drive towards more renewable energy and storage and transmission because it’s good for emissions and the cheapest form of energy by far. And call me old-fashioned, but I think the answer to higher prices is to use more of the cheaper form of energy, together with transmission and storage to go with it. But to be very clear, in the short term, the world including Australia faces ongoing pressure. And of course, our federal government isn’t gonna sit by and watch that just simply through a flow through the households. We will consider carefully and in consultation with my state and territory colleagues, but we will consider careful interventions to ensure that the energy market is working as best as it can for Australian consumers, industrial and residential, in a lot of these very real and significant international pressures, which were being very upfront and honest about. ‘Crazy stuff’: Labor criticises Dutton’s nuclear reactor proposal The debate on energy rages on, as the Albanese government and federal opposition take hits at each other’s solutions to tackling the crisis. Opposition leader Peter Dutton revealed in his budget reply speech last night that he believes Australia should consider zero-emissions modular nuclear reactors. Members of the Labor government including the education minister, Jason Clare, and the member for Macnamara, Josh Burns, have criticised the proposal. Clare told Seven’s Sunrise program: They think the solution is to build 80 nuclear power stations right across the country. Come on, that is crazy stuff. Burns has taken to social media with a series of tweets criticising the proposal: Dutton also talks about Small Modular Reactors as the type to build. But they aren’t cheaper. In fact, they don’t actually exist yet. There’s no SMR being rolled out anywhere in the world, only prototypes in their early stages. We have roughly a decade to replace and build enough energy to meet demand as most of the coal power comes off our grid. The best estimates show that 1 nuclear reactor would take between 10-15 years to build. Short-cutting that timeline would mean risking safety, and put huge pressure on acquiring the expertise required to manage nuclear energy production that we just don’t have in Australia. Elective surgery waitlists shortening in Victoria The number of Victorians waiting for elective surgery has fallen in the September quarter, as Covid pressure on the state’s hospitals eased. The report comes ahead of Victoria’s state election next month, where health and hospital funding is a key battleground. The Victorian Agency for Health Information’s latest quarterly report shows there are 84,955 people on the elective surgery waiting list, down from 85,999 at the end of June. Victoria’s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, will be addressing the media later this morning when she opens a new surgical centre in Blackburn. Former head of recovery agency received severance payout after restructure, senate hears Officials have confirmed that the former head of the National Recovery and Resilience Agency, Shane Stone, received a severance payout after the new government restructured disaster recovery structures. In September, the Albanese government merged two bodies to form a new organisation called the National Emergency Management, Resilience and Recovery Agency. Stone – whose contract was not due to expire until 2024 – lost his job in the process. Murray Watt, the minister for emergency management, acknowledged that he had called for Stone’s resignation prior to the election. In March, Stone attracted criticism over comments appearing to blame people who “want to live among the gum trees” for the cost of recovering from catastrophic floods. More history on that can be found here. Watt said today that he believed it was important to treat Stone with dignity during the restructuring process in September. Effectively, Mr Stone’s position was redundant … You won’t find any media comments from me around that time bagging him. Michael Pezzullo, the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, said Watt had asked him to engage with Stone “to explain to him the employment repercussions” of that restructuring. Pezzullo said that with the cessation of the role, “severance for the balance of the term were honoured”: They were honoured to the dollar and I’ve made sure that and we worked that through our personnel area, and I acquitted that by reporting back to the minister that that had been done. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has announced some new appointments this morning to the board of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority which he says will bring “fresh thinking” and promote more women to key positions. John Lonsdale has been appointed to be the next chair, Margaret Cole to become a deputy chair, and Suzanne Smith and Therese McCarthy Hockey to become members. The appointments will mean four of the five members of the regulator’s board are women. Lonsdale has been a deputy chair of Apra since 2018 and, prior to joining Apra, was a deputy secretary in the Australian Treasury. Cole, currently an Apra member, was previously PwC’s UK chief risk officer and general counsel and worked for the UK Financial Services Authority. The appointments will commence on 31 October 2022. Chalmers thanked Wayne Byres, the outgoing chair, for his dedication and leadership over the past eight years on behalf of the government. Chalmers said: Mr Byres has made an outstanding contribution to Australia, including through his work to help ensure the stability of the financial system during the Covid‑19 pandemic. The minister for emergency management, Murray Watt, has given an update to Senate estimates on the response to disasters in several states. He says that in the time since he was appointed as minister, Australia has experienced devastating loss of life and the impacts of storms and floods. He acknowledges people in Victoria and NSW currently sitting in relief centres or cleaning up homes as rivers continue to rise. In the past month alone, we have had 106 activations of commonwealth state disaster recovery funding arrangements – 43 in New South Wales, 17 in Tasmania, and 46 in Victoria, and that gives you some idea of the scale of the current disaster and of course, there’s been many more before that for the previous floods this year. Watt says there are about 350 ADF personnel currently working Victoria and 150 in NSW. The government will always step up and do the right thing standing with communities through the crisis and through recovery. Australia’s first coordinator general for national emergency management, Brendan Moon, is also at the Senate estimates table. Moon gives a sobering update: Since the start of this year, the nation has experienced 41 natural disaster events that have impacted over 280 local government areas. This constitutes more than half the local government areas of Australia. Our system is under pressure from consecutive concurrent natural disasters. Moon says in recent years it seems like many communities “have been in a constant state of response and recovery”. Intelligence watchdog is ‘not making any complaints about resourcing’, inspector general says At Senate estimates, the Greens senator David Shoebridge draws attention to the Asio’s big budget increases, and contrasts it with the watchdog, the inspector general of intelligence and security. Shoebridge asks whether the office of the inspector general has the resources it needs to perform its role. The inspector general of intelligence and security, Christopher Jessup KC, replies: I suppose that’s like a Dorothy Dixer, senator. (Meaning that any agency will always ask for a budget increase.) Jessup continues: We’re not making any complaints about the level of resourcing. The difficulty is getting resources for which we have appropriations. That’s a reference to the earlier evidence about the office’s difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled staff and the wait of 12 to 18 months for security clearances. The office investigates complaints made by the public, or by a current or former staff of an intelligence agency, about the activities of an intelligence agency. It said in its annual report: The Office received 80 complaints during the year [2021-22] that fell within the jurisdiction of the IGIS Act. In addition, the Office received 141 complaints about visa and citizenship matters which are reported separately. The Office also considered more than 400 additional pieces of correspondence to determine whether they fell within the Inspector-General’s jurisdiction … In the same year, the office received 10 disclosures of suspected wrongdoing by intelligence agencies under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. There were 10,050 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 25 people are in intensive care. There were 8,537 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. ‘We are in awe of Jaala’s strength’: Andrews pays tribute to retiring minister The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, released a statement acknowledging Jaala Pulford’s achievements, including as the state’s first female agriculture minister, and her work to legalise locally manufactured medicinal cannabis for use in exceptional circumstances. He also reflected on the duo’s announcement for $35m to research children’s cancers. It was personal for Pulford – her daughter, Sinead, died three months after she received her diagnosis, right after the Victorian state election in 2014. She was 13 years old. Andrews said of Pulford’s loss: We all were, and still are, in awe of Jaala’s strength. To see her continue to manage her ministerial responsibilities with such heart, while holding on to that pain, was nothing short of remarkable. She made the Victorian parliament a kinder, more thoughtful place. She gave us all cause to reflect, and to garner a little perspective. She will be sorely missed by many on both sides of the aisle. The Victorian government minister Jaala Pulford has announced she will quit from politics, four weeks out from the state election. Pulford, who currently holds the portfolios of employment, innovation, medical research and the digital economy, small business and resources (it’s a long list) says after 16 years as an MP, “it’s time to seek new challenges” Here’s some of her statement: Representing the people of Western Victoria has been an extraordinary privilege. Serving the people that rely on Labor governments has been a tremendous honour. While it is amazing to pass a law, design a program or fund a project, the best thing about being a politician is the people we meet. The publican fighting for his business. The parents fearing their 18-year-old was being lost to them because a law lacked nuance. People whose lives were forever changed by illness, injury or death and who then raise money for science, or visit schools to talk to teenagers about road safety. The First Nations leaders delivering economic prosperity for their people. The grandmother in the farm shed that took me aside, put her hand on my arm and said: “it’s about time we had a woman in the job ... I’m conscious that I’m making this decision on the eve of a state election but I’m absolutely confident that the time is right for me, and for the government. In premier Daniel Andrews, our talented and energetic cabinet, and the magnificent Labor caucus, Victorians have a group of people with a vision and plan to make Victoria fairer, safer and stronger. Australia’s intelligence watchdog has had difficulties recruiting and retaining staff amid delays with security clearances. The inspector general of intelligence and security, Christopher Jessup KC, is answering questions at the Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs committee this morning. His office’s annual report stated: More generally, although the Office had many new staff join it over the year, the planned expansion to the Office’s full complement of staff has not yet been reached for a number of reasons, including those related to the necessary but lengthy security clearance process. The Office, like many public sector agencies, continues to feel the challenges of recruiting and retaining subject matter experts across a range of skillsets. This passage relates to difficulty finding technical experts. Jessup said the office – which plays an oversight role in monitoring the work of Australia’s intelligence and security agencies including Asio – was expected to increase staffing levels to 57 within a year but “we’re nowhere near that at the moment”. He said it was currently in the high 40s. He said some people recruited to the office already had the necessary security clearances – but for those who did not, there could be a lengthy wait: The security clearance process these days – 12 months is a good outcome from what I understand. A more average outcome is getting towards 18 months. Jessup said during this vetting period, some recruits became interested in a different job elsewhere and “disappear out of the pipeline”. We’re at a much greater risk of losing people when they happen to be, for example, a specialist in IT … because they are in high demand. Virus-infected cruise ship to dock in WA A cruise ship with Covid-19 cases on board is set to dock near Perth but authorities are confident the outbreak can be safely managed, AAP reports. The Coral Princess has an undisclosed number of infected passengers and crew as it prepares to arrive in Fremantle today. Its operator, Carnival Australia, says most of the ship’s 2,000 guests are unaffected and those who return a negative rapid antigen test will be allowed ashore. The Carnival president, Marguerite Fitzgerald, said: We continue to monitor closely a small number of guests who tested positive to Covid-19 and who are isolating and are being cared for in their stateroom by our medical and support staff. All cases on board have been asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic. Case numbers remain relatively steady. There are also reports of cases being detected aboard the Quantum of the Seas, a ship expected to dock in Brisbane next Tuesday. The Coral Princess left Broome earlier this week, bypassing a scheduled stop in Geraldton due to bad weather. WA Health said it was aware of the ship’s outbreak but had not been asked for help in managing passengers. It said all cruise ship operators visiting WA were required to report cases, abide by the national protocols and have their own Covid-19 plans. People who contract Covid-19 while aboard vessels are advised to isolate for five days. Large cruise ships have been allowed back in WA waters since 1 October after being banned in 2020. US and China must create ‘political space to resume global climate collaboration’: Rudd The former prime minister Kevin Rudd has shared the Guardian’s reporting on key UN climate reports which warn urgent and collective action is needed as the world nears “irreversible” climate breakdown. Rudd said it’s critical the US and China, as the world’s two largest emitters, manage the strategic competition between them in order to resume global climate collaboration. Labor set for Victorian win despite poll decline Labor remains on track for a crushing victory at Victoria’s state election despite a rise in support for the Coalition over the past month, AAP reports. A Resolve Political Monitor survey for the Age newspaper showed primary support for the premier Daniel Andrews’ party was at 38%, down from 41% in mid-September. The poll, published today, also revealed backing for the Liberal and National parties was up to 31% from 28% in the previous survey. Despite the rise, the results still point to an overwhelming victory for the Andrews government when Victorians cast their ballots on 26 November. On a two-party-preferred basis, Labor was well ahead at 59% to 41% for the Coalition. Primary support for the Greens, independents and other minor parties was steady at 30%. The Resolve poll of more than 800 voters was taken from October 20 to 24, a period that coincided with Labor releasing an ambitious plan to speed up the state’s transition to renewable energy. The Andrews government set a 95% renewable energy target for 2035, the highest of any Australian state. Labor also pledged to re-enter the energy market with the revival of the State Electricity Commission. Meanwhile, the state opposition has recently pitched legal protection for religious schools and other employers to hire staff who share their values and beliefs. The latest Resolve survey gave Andrews a growing lead over the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, as preferred premier at 49% to 29% with the remainder undecided. The previous survey gave Andrews a 46-28% lead. Perrottet calls for greater infrastructure funding Perrottet also used the press conference to call for greater infrastructure funding for NSW from the federal government, as he has done many times in recent weeks. Standing beside Albanese, he said that no matter who was in charge in Canberra, NSW was always punished for its development “success”. He challenged other states to do the same. There are other states who aren’t doing the heavy lifting, and I say to them, start building as much as we are in our great state. We should continue to get more funding from a commonwealth government. I’m always going to stand up for the people of NSW. The deputy NSW premier, Paul Toole, says there will be information sessions for local government areas, and that the government wants to build back the Northern Rivers “better than what it was before”. State MP Janelle Saffin affirms that the support the government is offering Northern Rivers residents will be tailored on a “case by case” basis. ‘We are a traumatised community’: Kevin Hogan The federal member for Page, Kevin Hogan, says the Northern Rivers community remains traumatised. Even the rain event last week “triggered everyone again”. We are a traumatised community. That’s why today is important. Albanese says he has asked the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, to lead discussions at national cabinet about “planning to do better to make sure that we’re not building on flood plains”. To make sure that we’re not building on flood plains … I’ve asked the premier to lead discussion at the national cabinet about how we make sure that planning gets better right around our country. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, are addressing the media from Lismore, announcing the joint buyback scheme for Australians living in flood-prone areas. The $800m plan will see residents in Ballina, Byron, Clarence Valley, Kyogle, Lismore, Richmond Valley and Tweed LGAs able to apply for grants to help cover the costs of having their houses raised, retrofitted or repaired. Albanese says: We need to do better, all levels of government. We need to do better on planning but we also need to do better than thinking that we can do just the same thing over and over again, because we’ll get the same results. And that’s why I am so proud of today’s announcement … an $800m commitment with $700m of that commitment shared between the two levels of government on a 50/50 basis. $520m to be available for buybacks, so that people like Brian can move to somewhere that is - makes more sense than just trying to retrofit here. But up to $1,000,000 to raise some homes in the northern rivers area as well. And up to $50,000 for retrofitting. In addition, we have agreement about planning. To do better. Albanese also acknowledges that the announcement about the Northern Rivers comes as the east coast states continue to be affected by flooding. This current event, weather event, has impacted particularly the east coast states right up and down it. New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have been really harshly affected. But Queensland was under threat and we remain vigilant for weather events in coming weeks and indeed, perhaps even months. ‘Diverse range of opinions’ on Voice in regional communities: Dutton Peter Dutton did not mention the Uluru Statement from the Heart in his budget reply speech, as opposed to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who began his speech Tuesday night backing it. ABC Radio asks Dutton when he will reveal how he’ll vote on the Voice to Parliament? I was up in Alice Springs last week and Thursday Island the week before, so we’ve been speaking with local elders and women in particular in many of those communities. I’m listening to their voices at the moment and having an understanding of what they believe the Voice is about and what they want from a Voice and in fact whether or not they support a Voice. There’s quite a diverse range of opinion across the Indigenous communities as you get away from Canberra and Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane and you move into the regional communities. In his budget reply, Dutton backed in Labor’s childcare changes. Karvelas asks Dutton what changed his mind? There is a lot more to do to provide support and to remove some of the barriers for [women] go back into work. If you’re a family with three young kids in childcare, you’ve probably got for your, for one of the partners to return to work – normally to the mother in a relationship – you end up having to earn probably, you have to gross about $120,000 a year before you’re at a break even point. Dutton didn’t state a position on the extension of paid parental leave from 20 to 26 weeks in his budget reply but tells ABC Radio he supports the measure: Yes, I think that’s reasonable. And we’ve just got to be careful about what’s happening in the industrial relations space at the moment, because if we price ourselves out of competitive market, where we’re up against other countries that don’t have industrial relations system that Labor’s about to introduce this as a throwback to the 1980s. Asked if he regrets the former government didn’t implement any of these policies he is now supporting, Dutton says the problems on issues such as childcare and women was the Coalition’s marketing. One of the things we don’t do well in the Liberal party is we don’t market well what we did. We’re good at governing and we often clean up Labor’s messes … but we don’t market well enough what we did. ‘We should have a discussion about the zero emission modular nuclear reactors’: Dutton Dutton has proposed small modular nuclear reactors as a possible solution to the energy crisis. If you don’t like coal, you don’t like gas, hydro is probably a decade away, you’ve got limited options. All I’ve said is we should have a discussion about the zero emission modular nuclear reactors. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks the opposition leader about what Australia does in the nearly 10 years before these modular nuclear reactors exist? All of us are in favour of renewable energy of course, the fact is we need to firm the system up of a night-time. Dutton says budget failed on cost-of-living relief Opposition leader Peter Dutton delivered his official budget reply address last night, and is now speaking with ABC Radio, saying cost of living relief for families is what is missing from Labor’s budget. Families know they are going to experience a very significant increase their electrify costs, petrol prices their mortgage repayments. I think they thought there was going to be some offering through the budget for some support and I just don’t think there was. First Nations lawyer, academic and activist Noel Pearson last night delivered his first speech in the ABC’s Boyer Lectures, saying “racism will diminish” with recognition from the Indigenous voice to parliament. Pearson said, of all the claims he will make in these lectures, “the boldest” is that: Racism will diminish in this country when we succeed with recognition. It will not have the same purchase on us: neither on the majority party that has defaulted to it over two centuries, nor the minority that lives it, fears it and who too often succumb to the very fear itself. Let me point out what is incontrovertible: Australia doesn’t make sense without recognition. Until the First Peoples are afforded our rightful place, we are a nation missing its most vital heart. However, he said Australians still do not have the same empathy on the issue as they had when it came to the plebiscite on same-sex marriage because they do not see Aboriginal people “within their circles of family and friendship”: Unlike same-sex marriage, there is not the requisite empathy of love to break through the prejudice, contempt and, yes, violence, of the past. Australians simply do not have Aboriginal people within their circles of family and friendship with whom they can share fellow feeling. Later today, energy ministers will meet and look at a gas price cap at about a third of current market offers to help ease inflation threats.

Fugitive emissions from Australia’s LNG industry also continue to fuel rising national emissions. Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that publishes quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data months ahead of the federal government, says its latest research shows emissions for the year to March 2019 increased to 561 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That was up from 554.5 million tonnes the previous year and 551.2 million tonnes in 2017. These figures exclude unreliable data from the land-use sector, but Ndevr said that even when land-use was included emissions had still increased for four consecutive years over the same period. According to Ndevr’s research, there was an 8.2% increase in emissions from the electricity sector between the December and March quarters. It follows three consecutive quarters of declines in electricity emissions and is the highest increase in emissions from that sector since March 2017. However, rising emissions from electricity generation between the December and March quarters is not unusual due to higher energy use in the warmer months. Ndevr’s managing director, Matt Drum, said there was less renewable generation in March 2019 than there was in the March quarter the previous year, with Ndevr’s data showing falls in both wind and hydro power. Drum said the continued rise in fugitive emissions as a result of Australia’s LNG industry showed there was “a lot of work to be done around offsetting and reducing emissions from the LNG sector”. “That’s offsetting particularly through land-use projects, but also energy efficiency,” he said. “And whether the carbon capture and storage nut can be cracked for that sector is going to be really important.” Drum dismissed recent comments by Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, that LNG exports were contributing to emissions reductions overseas. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I don’t think you can prosecute that argument unless you also take into account our coal exports, which have a counter effect,” Drum said. There is no evidence to support Taylor’s claim and the biggest consumer of Australia’s LNG – Japan – is using it in place of emissions-free nuclear power. “There’s still work to be done on policy. I sound like a broken record,” Drum said. “At the end of the day, participation in the emissions reduction fund is decreasing. Fewer projects, fewer contracts, less abatement. “Unless something happens, something significant, this government will just be presiding over quarter after quarter, year after year, of increasing emissions. It’s as simple as that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/nov/24/boris-johnson-speech-peppa-pig-pmqs-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-24T17:23:10Z","webTitle":"PMQs: Starmer attacks Johnson over social care plans as Tories insist prime minister is not losing grip – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/nov/24/boris-johnson-speech-peppa-pig-pmqs-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/nov/24/boris-johnson-speech-peppa-pig-pmqs-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"PMQs: Starmer attacks Johnson over social care plans as Tories insist prime minister is not losing grip – as it happened","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has called Boris Johnson’s social care plan a “working-class dementia tax”, accusing the prime minister of breaking the Conservatives’ manifesto promise that no one would have to sell their home to pay care costs. No 10 has said that Boris Johnson will be chairing a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee this afternoon to discuss the situation in the Channel. It follows a report that more than 20 people have died after a boat carrying refugees sunk. My colleague Caroline Davies is covering the latest developments on a separate live blog. The House of Commons will review rules that led to the Labour MP Stella Creasy being reprimanded for bringing her young baby while she spoke at a debate in parliament, the Speaker has announced. Boris Johnson once again flouted official requests to wear a mask as he watched a performance of Macbeth at a busy theatre in north London on Tuesday night, witnesses say. David Cameron lobbied a director of Lloyds Banking Group, whom the former prime minister had given a peerage, to reverse the bank’s decision to withdraw support from Greensill Capital, which it later did. The shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, is expecting to be the first serving MP to have a child through surrogacy. Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee this afternoon to discuss Channel crossings, No 10 has said. The announcement follows the news that many people - more than 20, according to some reports - have died tried to cross the Channel today. Savanta ComRes has released some new polling showing Labour ahead of the Conservatives, but with its lead narrowing compared to earlier this month. The polling also shows Boris Johnson well ahead of Keir Starmer on who would make the best PM. Speaking at the Operation Pitting reception at the House of Parliament, to honour civilians and members of the armed forces who worked on evacuation of Britons and others at risk from Kabul in August, Boris Johnson described this as one of the greatest achievements of the armed forces in the postwar era. He said: What really struck me talking to you was the professionalism, the care, with which you dealt with human beings in an extreme state of fear and distress and the diplomacy with which you worked with those Afghans, Taliban or otherwise. And it was a quite amazing thing to see what you did, and I believe that the safe passage of 15,000 people - 15,000 people - to this country, as well as helping 36 other countries to move those to whom they owe their own debts. That operation – Operation Pitting - will go down as one of the great achievements of our UK armed services in the whole of the post war era. Johnson used a similar line in his party conference speech. His comment was judged hubristic and misleading, not because of any doubts about the professionalism of those involved in Operation Pitting, but because the airlift was only necessary after the Taliban swept to power, the 20-year Nato deployment in Afghanistan having ended in what was widely seen as failure. Stephen Chandler, the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), has said the money pledged by central government for social care over the next three years is “grossly inadequate”. As PA Media reports, Adass has called for £1.5bn emergency funding for the winter and a further £1.5bn to help family carers. Speaking at this year’s National Children and Adult Services Conference, Chandler said his organisation was hearing reports from across the country of staff quitting for better pay and less responsibility, in sectors such as retail and hospitality, while unpaid carers are “buckling under the strain”. He told the conference: So far, our calls seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Which is a tragedy, because that £3bn would be less than 1% of what the government has spent in response to the Covid pandemic and yet it would see us safely through the months ahead. The government has pledged £5.4bn to social care over the next three years, out of a total £36bn to be raised from the new health and social care levy. The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Heather Stewart and Polly Toynbee discuss the government’s narrowly approved social care plan and Boris Johnson’s bizarre CBI speech. Plus: Can Priti Patel solve the issue of Channel crossings? Rowena Mason is joined by Rajeev Syal and Sunder Katwala. Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, has accused Sir Geoffrey Cox of “taking the mick” after it emerged that today he has again been taking part in the British Virgin Islands commission of inquiry, via video link. Revelations earlier this month about Cox working on the inquiry, on behalf of the BVI, from the Caribbean, and about the amount he was paid, were a major factor in persuading Boris Johnson to come out in principle in favour of tightening the rules on MPs having second jobs. Although today’s ONS figures show that the number of domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales went up by 6% in the year ending in March (see 10.07am), Labour has pointed out that the number of prosecutions was down by 10%. Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence, said: Staggeringly, this government has overseen yet another rise in the number of victims experiencing domestic abuse. Police recorded cases have doubled in the last five years and yet prosecutions for this crime continue to plummet. We are seeing women and girls being failed at every step of their journey by this government. These figures are a damning indictment of the inaction by this Conservative government which show that while the number of victims rise, fewer perpetrators are being brought to justice. The government must stop making excuses and immediately implement the measures in Labour’s violence against women and girls green paper including making misogyny a hate crime, increasing the minimum sentence for rape and stalking, and introduce a new law on street harassment - as well as implementing the urgent recommendations of the recent HMICFRS inspection. No country has shown an interest in hosting offshore processing centres for people seeking asylum, a Home Office minister has admitted. Asked if a country has shown serious interest in working with the government on its plan, Kevin Foster told Radio 4’s World At One: We haven’t had a country say to what you’ve suggested yet, but certainly we are in conversations with a number of partners, but for obvious reasons I’m not going to get into the details of them. Foster’s statement follows multiple reports citing Home Office and Whitehall sources that the UK has been in talks about “outsourcing” recent arrivals. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is under pressure to come up with a solution after she pledged 11 times to make the Channel route by small boats ‘unviable’ for those seeking asylum in the UK. In evidence to the Commons international trade committee this morning, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, rejected suggestions that the free trade deal with New Zealand would disadvantage British farmers. She said New Zealand farmers were unlikely to flood the UK market with their produce because currently they do not use the full tariff-free quota they already have. She told the committee: In terms of New Zealand trade, they have a big WTO [World Trade Organisation] quota at the moment which they don’t use with us anyway. In and of itself, this particular trade deal is not in any sense something that will cause great anxiety because they have tariff-free quota which they don’t use here because they are focused towards those Asia-Pacific markets. And if New Zealand did export more beef to the UK, it would probably be at the expense of EU producers, she said. She said the UK currently imports more beef from the EU than from New Zealand, and she went on: Any increased exports from New Zealand, should there be a shift away from other markets they want to use for their sales, it will be likely to displace those imports rather than hurt UK farmers. The Foreign Office has issued a statement urging all Britons in Ethiopia to leave the country now, while commercial flights are still available, because rebel forces are getting closer to the capital. Vicky Ford, the Africa minister, said: The conflict in Ethiopia is deteriorating quickly. In the coming days we may see the fighting move closer to Addis Ababa, which could severely limit options for British Nationals to leave Ethiopia. I am urging all British Nationals – whatever their circumstance - to leave immediately, while commercial flights are readily available and Addis Ababa Bole International Airport remains open. Interest free loans are available to help British Nationals to return to the UK who may otherwise struggle to afford flights. Those who choose not to leave now should make preparations to shelter in a place of safety over the coming weeks. We cannot guarantee there will be options to leave Ethiopia in the future. Boris Johnson once again flouted official requests to wear a mask as he watched a performance of Macbeth at a busy theatre in north London on Tuesday night, witnesses say. My colleague Rowena Mason has the story here. Keir Starmer’s spokesman has said that Labour supports enabling parents to combine work with caring responsibilities, but that it is for the Commons to decide if MPs should be allowed to take babies into the chamber. Asked about Starmer’s personal views on this matter, the spokesman said: If you look at our overall approach, you will have clearly seen that we are supportive when it comes to wanting people to be able to juggle their work and caring responsibilities. And there are a whole range of measures on flexible working that the Labour party has proposed over the course of the summer, but specifically in terms of prescribing what should happen in the House of Commons chamber, then that is a matter for the procedure committee of the House of Commons to look at, as has been mandated by the Speaker. And so it’s right to let them report. Nearly half of British adults lack confidence that the Government will succeed in levelling up parts of the UK over the next decade, PA Media reports. PA says: The survey, from research agency Public First, found that a majority of people think their own area needs levelling up (65%), with the proportion highest in Yorkshire and The Humber (82%). But only 23% are confident the government will successfully help level up areas in the UK in the next 10 years. Nearly half (48%) are not confident of this, and the remainder either do not lean one way or the other, or do not know. Of all the British regions, only people in London were confident, on balance, that the government would succeed. Here are the main lines from the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing. No 10 signalled its support for a change to the rule banning MPs from taking babies into the Commons chamber. The PM’s spokesman noted that the Speaker has announced a review of the rule (see 11.40am) and he said this was a matter for the Commons, not the government. But he also said: We want the workplace in any circumstances to be modern and flexible and fit for the 21st century. The exact way that operates is rightly a matter for the house. No 10 rejected suggestions that the prime minister and the chancellor’s teams are not working well together. Responding to reports covering this topic (see 9.31am and 11.47am), the PM’s press secretary said: I’ve seen various anonymous source briefings that I’m not going to get into. But the prime minister and the chancellor and the entire government is focused simply on getting on with delivering on the people’s priorities. Asked if No 10 and the Treasury were working well together, the press secretary replied: “Yes.” The press secretary would not comment on reports that some Tory MPs have written to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, asking for vote of no confidence in Johnson. (See 11.47am.) But Johnson has not spoken to Brady about the reports. “The prime minister is entirely focused on delivering his ambitious agenda,” the press secretary said. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story on PMQs. Superficially, it seemed to go a lot better for Boris Johnson this week than last week. That was because Conservative backbenchers actually turned up in the usual numbers - last week many of them staged a rare boycott, leaving empty spaces on the green benches (not explained by a sudden conversion to the merits of social distancing) - and because they cheered Johnson loudly. But noise in the House of Commons needs careful interpreting; sometimes MPs are cheering because they think their leader is doing well, but sometimes it’s the opposite; the volume goes up because the leader is in trouble and needs support. Today seemed to be a good example of the latter - comfort chuntering, rather than enthusiasm chuntering. Johnson did manage to bluster his way through his exchanges with Keir Starmer with some confidence and the occasional effective counter-punch. But, on the substance of the exchanges, he lost more or less 6-0, and Starmer was able to land three quite important messages. Starmer started by asking Johnson to admit that people will have to sell their homes under his plans for social care, contrary to the promise in the Conservative election manifesto. He asked the same question two months ago, at PMQs the day after the plan was first announced, but on that occasion Johnson simply ignored the question. However, yesterday for the first time Downing Street effectively admitted that its plan could lead to some people having to sell their homes. Johnson was not prepared to say as much at PMQs, but it was implicit in the language he used to defend his plans. Starmer was right, and he knew it. The Labour leader made three broader points, which made his questions particularly effective. First, he turned this into a wider argument about broken promises. It is not the first time he has accused Johnson of breaking promises, of course, but this is an accusation that becomes more compelling, not less, every time the catalogue of examples gets longer, and when Starmer asked how voters will believe anything Johnson said at the next election, there must have been a few Tories thinking he had a point. He said: Strip away the bluster, strip away the deflection, strip away the refusal to answer the question, there’s a simple truth and this is why the prime minister won’t address it, people will still be forced to sell their homes to pay for care. It’s another broken promise, just like he promised that he wouldn’t put up tax, just like he promised 40 new hospitals, just like he promised a rail revolution in the North. Who knows if he’ll make it to the next election, but if does how does he expect anyone to take him and his promises seriously? Second, Starmer coined a new phrase to attack the social care plan. He called it a “working class dementia tax”, arguing that the working class would pay because it would be the assets of the middle class that would be protected, not theirs. It is not the catchiest slogan ever, but the “dementia tax” tag worked brilliantly against Theresa May’s 2017 social care plans and this works as plausible attack line against Johnson’s. And, third, Starmer argued that this was a plan that would involve people paying twice. He said: Working people are being urged to pay twice. During their working lives they’ll pay much more tax in national insurance whilst those living off wealth are protected. Then when they retire, they face having to sell their home when the wealthiest won’t have to do so. Starmer went on to use a vivid metaphor to describe what was going on. It’s a classic con game. A Covent Garden pickpocketing operation. The prime minister is the frontman, distracting people with wild promises and panto speeches whilst his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. “Working class dementia tax” and “paying twice” are both ways of presenting the same critique. But they are both imaginative, and potentially persuasive. Starmer’s main weakness, though, is that Labour has not yet got an alternative to the government plan, and Johnson was at his strongest making this point. At the next election, attacking Johnson as someone who has broken his promises, and whose social care plan is flawed, will take Labour a long way, but ultimately people want to be able to vote for something positive too. Miriam Cates (Con) asks about funding in the budget for the start for life programme. Will it be extended more widely? Johnson praises Andrea Leadsom for promoting this, and he says if it works it will be rolled out across the whole country. John Nicolson (SNP) says the PM has abandoned his plan for a bridge to Ireland. Perhaps he will replace them with hot air ballons, that he can fill himself. Johnson says the government is delivering the first thorough review of union connectivity. Sir Mike Penning (Con) claims local NHS management is blocking a new hosptial for Hemel Hempstead. Johnson says he will arrange a meeting on this. John Spellar (Lab) says he will introduce a bill to ban the import of hunting trophies. Will the government let the bill go forward? Johnson says the government will introduce its own legislation to ban this. Layla Moran (Lib Dem) asks what the government will do to encourage businesses to give away spare food at Christmas. Johnson says he thinks businesses do a good job already. He cites Iceland as an example. On supply chain problems, he claims they are starting to ease. He claims they are the result of the economy bouncing back, which would not have happened under Labour, he claims. Sir David Evennett (Con) asks if the PM will continue to implement the 2019 manifesto. Johnson says he will. He is delivering on his agenda for London, he says. And he will opposed the proposed outer London tax that would penalise motorists for driving into their own city, he says. Alan Brown (SNP) asks the government to back a tidal power scheme in Scotland. Johnson says the government will include support for tidal stream, to the value of £20m, in the forthcoming contracts for difference auction. Matthew Pennycook (Lab) asks if plans for a Chinese company to operate a nuclear power station in Bradwell have been abandoned. Johnson says the government does not want to allow potentially adversarial countries to have undue influence over national infrastructure. He says, on Bradwell, more information will be forthcoming. But he says he does not want to “pitch away” all Chinese investment. Nigel Mills (Con) asks the government to speed up payments to people who have suffered very rare, adverse reactions to vaccines. Johnson says more money is being put into the system for this. Hannah Bardell (SNP) asks about the decision not to approve the Valneva vaccine. Johnson says he was very disappointed when this could not be approved. But the government is investing massively in the country’s vaccine capacity ahead of a possible future pandemic, he says. And he says he hopes Valneva will be part of that. Karin Smyth (Lab) asks why the government has relaxed the rules for people wanting a licence to tow a trailer. Johnson says the government wants to free up time for driving test centres to focus on HGV drivers. But it will keep this under review, he says. Johnson says the government will use freeports to suppor the processing of critical minerals in the UK. Caroline Lucas (Green) asks why the government is proceeding with oil, gas and coal developments. Johnson says the government is powering past coal and wants to end fossil fuel reliance. Jonathan Lord (Con) asks if the government will protect BTechs. Johnson says the government will keep some of them, but it is promoting T-levels, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the past few weeks have seen the Tories at their worst: a corruption scandal, broken promises, tax rises, and a cancelled bridge to Ireland. Has the PM considered calling it a day? Johnson says people want to know what the government is doing for the people of Scotland. He says on Friday, or later this week, the union connectivity review will be published, showing what the government will do for rail links to Scotland. Blackford says, while the PM is hunting for chatty pigs (a nickname given for the person responsible for the anti-Johnson Downing Street briefing on Monday), people are giving up on him. Why is he clinging on? Johnson asks why Blackford is asking about party politics when people want to know what the government is doing for Scotland. He claims the SNP are falling in the polls. Starmer says working people are being asked to pay twice. They pay national insurance when they work, and when they retire they will have to sell their homes, because they will not be protected. He says it is a classic Covent Garden pick-pocketing operation. The PM entertains the crowd, while the chancellor picks their pocket. He quotes from what Tories have said attacking Johnson’s operating, and he ends with the words of the TV reporter after the CBI speech - is everything okay? Johnson claims that line of attack is not working. He claims the government is fixing problems no one tried to fix. And he ends saying if we had listened to Captain Hindsight, the country would still be in lockdown. Starmer says the only thing Johnson is delivering is high taxes, high prices and low growth. He says the social care plans will protect the wealthy. But everyone will have to pay for it. How could he have possibly delivered a working class dementia tax? Johnson says the government is doing more for working people than Labour ever did. Starmer says people will still be forced to sell their homes to pay for care. This is another broken promise, like his promise not to put up tax, his promise of 40 new hospitals, and his promise of a rail revolution in the north. He says if Johnson makes it to the next election, how will anyone take his promises seriously? Johnson says he is promising three new rail lines. He says there has been nothing like this for a century. He says last week he learned that Starmer campaigned against HS2. It runs through his constituency too, he says, but he backed it, even though it caused his constituents problems. Starmer asks who people will be able to afford £86,000 without selling their home. Johnson says Labour has not put forward any plans. He again defends his plan. Starmer says Johnson is describing the broken system he claims to be fixing. With Tory MPs shouting, he jokes that this week they have turned up. (Last week many Tories stayed away.) Starmer says Johnson used to say no one would have to sell their home to pay for care. Has he done that. Yes or no? Johnson says your home will be disregarded. You will have to contribute if you have assets worth more than £100,000, but he says homes are not included. (Johnson seems to have quoted the wrong figure. You start contributing at a level well below that.) Keir Starmer asks the PM to confirm that, when he promised at the election that no one would have to sell their home to pay for care, that was a broken promise. No, says Johnson. He says homes will be disregarded if people are still living in them. And there is a deferred payment scheme, that allows people to stay in their homes while they are alive. He says the government is taking away the anxiety around this. Felicity Buchan (Con) says her Kensington constituency suffered devastating flooding this summer. Does the PM agree Thames Water need to invest in infrastructure to stop this happening again? Johnson says she is right. He says he instituted the Thames tideway tunnel, which will address this. Chris Bryant (Lab) asks about a constituent whose son has seizures from a brain injury. She backs the acquired brain injury bill, he says. He asks if the government will back the bill. He says 1.4 million people are affected. Boris Johnson thanks Bryant for his commitment to this vital cause. The government is studying the bill, he says. He says he can pledge at this point that DHSC will lead on the development of a cross-departmental government strategy on this. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by saying at the requiem mass for Sir David Amess there were many reflections on his kindness and decency. He says he hopes those qualities are reflected in the proceedings today. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. And here are two of the more interesting columns in today’s papers on the situation in the Conservative party. Daniel Finkelstein in the Times (paywall) says it is absurd to expect Boris Johnson to change the way he operates. He says: Just before Gordon Brown became prime minister I had lunch with Philip Gould, the strategic adviser who was central to the creation of New Labour, and reviewed what was to come. “Gordon knows he will have to change now,” he said. And the moment he said that I realised the whole thing was going to be a fiasco. Because people don’t change ... Few people are less reliant upon their advisers than Johnson. People always say they want their politicians to write their own speeches and Peppa Pig is what happens when they do. Johnson finds it hard to let go of his script and doesn’t want to mouth platitudes written by someone else. So he scribbles all over the draft, shuffling the pages and adding in metaphors. It was a mess, but a genuine mess. He also doesn’t have any close political friends, similar in age and status to him. He does have people who will tell him the truth to his face. That’s not the problem. The problem is whether he will listen, believing his own political instinct to be stronger than those of other people. I heard it said yesterday that it was the performance of someone who had lost confidence. This is utterly wrong. It was the performance of someone who has supreme confidence in their own ability. You’d have to have such confidence in order to wing it in front of the CBI. Sebastian Payne in the FT (paywall) says economic problems pose the biggest risk to the Conservatives. While Farage and small boats are grabbing the most attention, another revolt on the right should not be Johnson’s chief fear. The bigger electoral challenges come from the fragile economy — rising inflation and interest rates, plus sluggish growth — and his seeming lack of governing grip, with a threat of winter shortages. Johnson’s policy outlook and style risks losing those voters his party picked up in 2005 and 2010. The battleground which may soon dominate British politics is the set of middle-class, middle-income, middle of the road, middle England seats which voted Tory because they were fed up with Labour. After 11 years in power, the cycle could be about to go into reverse. As discussed earlier, there are plenty of stories in today’s papers relating to the Conservative party, and their ongoing difficulties. Here is a selection. Jason Groves in the Daily Mail says Boris Johnson’s allies are blaming the Treasury team for a hostile briefing given to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Monday. He says: Several sources yesterday pointed the finger at the unit’s chief Liam Booth-Smith, who is said to make little effort to disguise his disdain for the PM. The former thinktank boss affects the same scruffy look as Mr [Dominic] Cummings and is said to share at least some of his criticisms of Mr Johnson. One former colleague claimed he was ‘not discreet’ about his criticism of the PM. Allies last night did not deny that Mr Booth-Smith has made disparaging remarks about Mr Johnson in the past, but insisted he is not the Chatty Pig. One said that, far from being unhelpful, he had spent Monday afternoon ringing round MPs trying to help the Government win a crunch vote on social care. ‘This is not from Liam or anyone else at the Treasury,’ said one source. ‘That suggestion is just an attempt to deflect the blame.’ The Telegraph says (paywall) there are claims that some Tory MPs have submitted letters to the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee calling for a vote of confidence in Johnson. One Tory whip told The Telegraph it was now an “assumption” that some disgruntled MPs had submitted no confidence letters to the 1922 Committee. The committee, made up of Tory backbenchers, collects any no confidence letters. If 15 per cent of sitting Conservative MPs submit them, a leadership contest is triggered. The Tory whip said: “There is an assumption someone has put in a letter. The rumour is persistently around. It will not get anywhere near the 50 letters you would need, but it does cause angst.” A second Tory MP said several of the “usual suspects” were believed to have lost confidence in Mr Johnson and submitted letters. Harry Cole in the Sun says Johnson told Tory donors at an event last night: “We will cut taxes ... soon.” The Financial Times (paywall) says David Cameron lobbied a banker whom he had placed in the House of Lords on behalf of Greensill Capital. It says: David Cameron lobbied Lloyds Banking Group to reverse a decision to cut ties with the ailing Greensill Capital, appealing to a board member whom he had ennobled while prime minister. Cameron lobbied Lloyds in January, according to people familiar with the matter, when he contacted Lord James Lupton, a director of the bank who had previously been a Conservative party treasurer, in a successful attempt to persuade the bank to continue doing business with Greensill. Lupton, Tory treasurer from 2013 to 2016, has donated more than £3m to the Conservative party and was appointed to the House of Lords in 2015, sparking accusations of cronyism against then-prime minister Cameron from rival politicians. Cameron earned millions of pounds as a boardroom adviser to Greensill, the supply-chain finance company whose unravelling earlier this year dragged the former prime minister into Westminster’s biggest lobbying scandal for a generation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is making a statement to MPs at the start of proceedings about the rules relating to babies in the chamber. He says he was not aware of the advice given to Stella Creasy until last night. He says what she was told reflects the rules. But he says rules have to be taken in context, and they have to change with the times. He says the chamber has to be able to function professionally and without disturbance. But the chair should be able to exercise discretion, he says. He says there are differing views on this matter, and that there are likely to be consequences from what is decided. So, he says, he has asked the chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, to look into this and to make recommendations. Ultimately it will be for the Commons to decide, he says. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, a trade body representing the temperature-controlled logistics industry, told MPs this morning that there would be fewer food items on the shelves this Christmas because of supply chain difficulties. He told the Commons transport committee: People have made decisions about what they think is achievable, and so we’ve got quite a significant scaling back in the amount of work we’re trying to do, particularly around Christmas. The food supply chain gears itself up to deliver at Christmas, and it’s quite a lot [to be] scaling back at the ambition of that. Whereas normally it’d be get as much out as possible, to sell as much as possible, to make as much revenue as possible for customers that time, we’re having to sort of scale that ambition back to try and deliver what we absolutely can. Brennan said this would mean a smaller range of items being available. It’s not about shortages, it’s about simplifying, so having less range obviously is one of the key decisions you can make in trying to make supply chains more efficient. And it’s about reducing the amount of goods you’re expected to put on the shelves and then working with the customer base to actually make that clear. We are very good at piling high and selling cheap at Christmas time. What we have to do is strategically scale that back in order to meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras. Many countries around the world are experiencing supply chain problems as the global economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic, but in the UK the difficulties have also been exacerbated by Brexit. Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, has announced that she will be taking maternity leave next year because she is having a baby through surrogacy. Last night the Labour MP Stella Creasy revealed that she has been told by the Commons authorities not to take her three-month old baby into the chamber. My colleague Peter Walker has the full story here. This morning Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, indicated that he would support Creasy in getting this rule changed. He told BBC Breakfast: Quite what the right balance is in terms of the chamber, let me leave that to the house authorities, but frankly I’ve got a lot of sympathy for Stella Creasy on all of these things because I’ve seen her with her young child, I’ve seen many other MPs on all sides of the house balancing this, and it’s difficult. I think we do need to make sure our profession is brought into the modern world, the 21st century, and can allow parents to juggle the jobs they do with the family time that they need. Raab also said that he would not mind seeing a backbencher with a baby in the chamber if he were speaking from the dispatch box. He said: When you see your colleagues with their children, given the rough and tumble of politics, I just always think it brings out the best in people. Whether it’s the right thing in the chamber, there will be different views on that, it will be for the house authorities to decide but it certainly wouldn’t distract me or get in the way of me doing my job. The Office for National Statistics has published figures this morning showing that the police recorded 845,734 domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales in the year ending March 2021. That is a 6% increase on the figure for the previous year, although the ONS also says this “may reflect improvements seen in reporting over the last few years”. An analysis published by the ONS last year said it was not possible to directly attribute the increase to lockdown because of improvements to the way these crimes are recorded. A separate report published by the ONS this morning says that, according to the crime survey (which measures people’s experience of crime, not crimes recorded by police), an estimated 1.6 million women between the age of 16 and 74 - around 7% of the female population - experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2020. And 3% of women in that age range experienced sexual assault, and 5% experienced stalking. The ONS says these trends have remained broadly similar over the past decade. The chancellor Rishi Sunak’s “tax cut for the low paid” announced in the October budget comes into force today with the promise that almost 2m low-income working households will get an average £1,000-a-year cash boost. With many less affluent households struggling with a cost of living crisis driven by soaring food and energy bills, ministers will make much of the move, pointing out some beneficiaries will see an income boost before Christmas. Sunak reduced the universal credit taper rate (the amount in benefits a claimant loses for each pound earned above the work allowance) from 63p to 55p in the pound – a policy actually floated two months prior to the budget by the Labour party. The government move, costing £2.2bn, was supposedly a way to soften the blow to families of the reversal of the universal credit £20 a week uplift put in place for the first 18 months of the pandemic (a cut which saved the Treasury £6bn). Critics point out the majority – 3m – families on universal credit will get zero financial benefit from Sunak’s taper rate “tax cut” adjustments – including those who can’t work, such as carers, parents of very young children, and sick and disabled people. Meanwhile, latest data from the Trussell Trust highlights how the tide of UK destitution continues to rise. The trust’s UK food bank network gave out 935k food parcels between 1 April and 30 September – a 74% increase on the same period five years ago. That’s the equivalent of 5,100 food parcels a day this year - up 11% on the same period in 2019 (though lower than 2020 lockdown crisis levels). And things aren’t getting any better: it expects to give out an average of 7,000 a day by December. And here is the story from my colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart on Dominic Raab’s defence of the PM in his morning interviews. Good morning. Early this week many Britons received their first introduction to Peppa Pig World. Borisworld is even more peculiar, and only in this environment could a speech now labelled after a cartoon character provide the trigger for a debate about the dysfunctionality of central government. Many papers are still carrying articles about why Downing Street is performing so badly, and in the Guardian we report on the frustrations in the Treasury at No 10’s inept handling of important decisions. Later Boris Johnson will have an opportunity to reset the narrative at PMQs. He will be hoping it goes better than last week’s, which was rather dismal. This morning Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, was defending the PM on the airwaves and essentially his argument what was widely described as an amateurish and eccentric speech to the CBI on Monday was essentially just evidence of the PM’s “Tiggerish” personality. Raab told Times Radio: The prime minister is on great form ... The prime minister is an ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character and he livens up his speeches in a way that few politicians past and present have done but actually there is a steeliness to him as a prime minister and indeed his team, and we work as a team. In an interview with the Today programme, where he made a similar argument, Raab also said: We are building back this country stronger, better, fairer, and [Johnson, in his Peppa Pig speech] wanted to make that point about the optimism that defines this country, both domestically and abroad. We do too much, frankly, self flagellating in Britain. It’s partly the result of the Brexit debate. I don’t want to get dragged back into all of that. But we’ve got a huge amount going for ourselves and I think that’s the essence of what this prime minister reflects. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, accused Raab of “insulting people’s intelligence”. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Senior DWP officials give evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee on universal credit. 9.30am: The Cold Chain Federation, the Road Haulage Association and Logistics UK give evidence to the Commons transport committee about the road freight supply chain. 10.30am: Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee about the trade deal with New Zealand. 11am: Northern mayors and council leaders hold an open meeting in Leeds to discuss the integrated rail plan. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 2pm: Permanent secretaries from the Cabinet Office, HMRC, Defra, and the Department for Transport give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about Brexit and border issues. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

It was, at best, a rash promise for how nuclear fusion might make the UK carbon-neutral by the middle of the century – the target recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government. “I know they have been on the verge for some time,” Johnson hedged. “It is a pretty spacious kind of verge.” But now, he assured his audience, “we are on the verge of the verge”. It’s a familiar and bitter joke about nuclear fusion as an energy source that, ever since it was first mooted in the 1950s, it has been 30 years away. Johnson’s comments had the extra irony that Brexit could merely add to that distance. It’s not clear what “commercially viable miniature fusion reactors” the prime minister had in mind. There are no such things either existing or planned at the main centre for fusion research in the UK, the Joint European Torus (Jet) at Culham in Oxfordshire, which Johnson visited in August. Experiments at Jet, conducted by all partners within the 28-state Eurofusion consortium, aim to make the nuclear fusion of hydrogen – the process that powers the sun and other stars – viable for energy generation by collecting the heat released to drive turbines for electricity. When Jet is running, the temperature inside is more than 100m C, making it “the hottest place in the solar system” according to CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Ian Chapman. Nuclear fusion is the merging of atoms. Every atom contains a very dense central blob called the nucleus, made up of particles called protons and neutrons. Atoms of different chemical elements have nuclei with different numbers of protons. If two nuclei collide at high enough energy, they can amalgamate to form a different, heavier element. It requires very high temperatures and densities: inside the sun, temperatures of 10m C or so enable hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium. This process releases energy, which makes the sun shine. Today’s nuclear power plants use not fusion but nuclear fission: the splitting apart of heavy nuclei. This happens spontaneously for radioactive elements such as uranium, and it too releases energy. But both the fuel and the products may remain highly radioactive for very long times – hundreds of thousands of years – creating health hazards and waste-disposal problems. What’s more, the fission process, which involves chain reactions that induce fission, can be hard to control and shut down, as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, in Ukraine and Japan, showed. Fusion is “nuclear power done right” – potentially much cleaner, safer and more efficient. “It seems too good to be true – high power density, low and manageable waste production, and no possibility of uncontrolled energy release,” says Tim Luce, chief scientist on the large international fusion project Iter, in the south of France. “But it is true!” Since its completion in 1983, Jet has been working towards the holy grail of net energy gain: extracting more from the fusion process than is put in to keep it alive. Its reactor induces fusion in a super-hot plasma of hydrogen fuel suspended by magnetic fields inside a doughnut-shaped device called a tokamak – the word is a Russian acronym, the design having first been proposed in the 1950s by Soviet physicists. In 1997 Jet set a world record for the highest ratio of energy out to energy in. But that was still just two-thirds of the break-even point where the reactor isn’t consuming energy overall. Jet was always intended as an experimental facility, however, and it will eventually hand on the baton to the $20bn Iter project, on which the EU and six other nations, including the United States, Russia and China, are collaborating. The construction of Iter is now nearing completion at Cadarache, near Aix-en-Provence. It hopes to conduct its first experimental runs in 2025, and eventually to produce 500 megawatts (MW) of power – 10 times as much as is needed to operate it. “The role of Iter is to realise power-plant levels of power and gain, and to begin to address the technological needs of power plants,” says Luce. The fuel used in these and other fusion reactors is not ordinary hydrogen – the lightest element, with a nucleus containing just one proton – but heavier hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium, which also have neutrons in their nuclei. The presence of neutrons lets fusion happen under less extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Deuterium is abundant: it makes up 0.02% of all the natural hydrogen in seawater, from which it can be extracted. But tritium is very rare and radioactive, disintegrating with a half-life of 12 and a quarter years. Tritium can be produced directly at a fusion facility by using the neutrons released as nuclei fuse to break apart lithium atoms, so that a reactor may “breed” its own fuel. It can also be extracted from heavy (deuterium-rich) water, which is how Jet gets it. But it’s costly, so deuterium-tritium fuel is only used on major test runs. Jet plans to conduct one next year – the first since the record-breaking demonstration in 1997. “We remain very optimistic that we’ll break the world record for fusion energy produced,” says Chapman. “Everyone is very excited because we haven’t done it for 20 years.” Iter, meanwhile, hopes to start using deuterium-tritium fuel in 2035. Jet won’t be jeopardised by Brexit. Chapman says that “we’ve signed a contract to operate Jet to the end of 2020, whatever happens with Brexit. And we’re already talking with our European partners about an extension to the end of 2024.” That’s not true of the UK’s role in Iter, however, which is the real big hope for the future of fusion. The country’s membership of the project comes through its affiliation with the European atomic energy programme Euratom – which is coupled to EU membership. “If you leave one, you leave the other,” says Tony Donné, programme manager of Eurofusion. With a withdrawal agreement, he says, “in principle the UK could stay in Euratom until the end of 2020, and then it’s in an easier position to negotiate for associate membership, as Switzerland already has”. But without one, the UK would need to renegotiate a fresh position in Iter from scratch. That’s possible – Ukraine has done it – but Donné says: “It would take a long time and I don’t know how it would go.” He adds: “In fusion, we have a tradition to work internationally, so it would be a pity if the UK [were to] drop out.” Even if it eventually became possible to rejoin Iter, “British industries might lose their chance of orders, and then when the UK comes back in in a few years’ time, maybe all the nice orders will have been given to other companies.” Not everything depends on these big international collaborations, however. The British government has given £220m to a UK-based project called Step (the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), which aims to build a working fusion reactor that will feed 100MW into the national grid by 2040. Later phases of the project will be cofunded by industry, and Step’s director Howard Wilson, a physicist at the University of York, says that it will benefit from the work done in parallel at Iter. Step uses a different design from Jet or Iter: the aforementioned spherical tokamak. “Rather than a ring doughnut, it looks more like a cored apple,” Wilson says. “The hole in the middle is much smaller.” This makes the reactor more compact and therefore potentially cheaper (that, perhaps, is what Johnson had in mind when alluding to “miniature” fusion reactors). But the spherical shape also creates problems, in particular dealing with the greater concentration of heat. One of the biggest challenges is the damage caused to the reactor materials by the extreme heat and the intense doses of neutron radiation. Iter won’t suffer too much of that because it will only run for short bursts. But a commercial reactor would need to operate more frequently, if not continuously, to be economically viable. Since Step will run more in that manner, it will need to tackle this crucial engineering issue. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has explored spherical tokamaks since building the world’s first prototype, called Start (the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak), in the 1990s. This design is also favoured by some of the small startup companies now trying to develop commercial fusion, such as Tokamak Energy, based at Milton Park, a few miles south of Culham in Abingdon. They hope to create a reactor small enough to fit on to the back of a lorry; the idea is that such systems could provide power locally to a factory or a town. But these companies – others exist in the US and Canada – are nowhere near having market-ready devices. The bigger projects welcome this injection of diversity. “We don’t see ourselves as in competition with the startups, but as complementary,” says Wilson. Chapman agrees: “The more bright people working on the problems, the better. I don’t think any of those companies is going to design and build a working reactor, but they might innovate on a particular component and help drive down the costs or improve performance.” The idea of having a nuclear reactor on the edge of town might sound alarming. But that’s largely because we have become familiar with the dangers of fission – the radioactive waste and the spectre of Chernobyl-style meltdowns. Fusion is different: there’s no real risk of it getting out of control, and much less radiation hazard. Chapman likens the process to a gas oven: “Fusion stops almost instantaneously once you stop fuelling it”, and a reactor typically only contains about one second’s worth of fuel at any moment. The challenge, he says, is to keep it going: “I’ve spent most of my career trying to do that.” No one believes that fusion will solve the immediate climate crisis. It’s not expected to come online until 2050, by which time many scientists say carbon emissions will already need to have fallen to zero to avoid the most serious climate impacts. But neither can renewables such as wind and solar power solve the problem on their own – their intermittency and low power density means, for example, that you couldn’t power large cities that way. Fusion will be perfect in that situation, says Donné, and he predicts it will be a major component of global energy generation in the second half of this century. “I came to fusion because I passionately believe that it is needed – that it can change the world,” says Chapman. “I’m convinced that not only is fusion important: it’s going to happen.” We’re not on the verge, but it’s just about in sight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/dec/14/woman-likely-to-lead-labour-jostling-to-succeed-jeremy-corbyn-begins","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-14T21:50:55Z","webTitle":"The race is on … and the next Labour leader is likely to be a woman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/woman-likely-to-lead-labour-jostling-to-succeed-jeremy-corbyn-begins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/dec/14/woman-likely-to-lead-labour-jostling-to-succeed-jeremy-corbyn-begins","fields":{"headline":"The race is on … and the next Labour leader is likely to be a woman","bodyText":"The battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and shape the future direction of the Labour party is under way as potential successors set out their leadership stalls for the first time, amid bitter recriminations after the party’s worst general election defeat since 1935. Two of the likely candidates in what will be a 12-week contest that is expected to begin in January – Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy – break cover with articles in the Observer, expressing their anger and dismay at the party’s crushing defeat, and calling for a far-reaching post-mortem to ensure Labour reconnects with the millions of working people who rejected it. Seven MPs, six of them women – Phillips, Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Yvette Cooper – are understood to be thinking of joining the contest, making it likely that Labour will for the first time elect a female leader. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is also likely to join the race. In the early hours of Friday, when the scale of Labour’s defeat was known, Corbyn announced that he would not lead Labour into another election but would stay to allow the party a period of “reflection” until a new leader was elected. While many MPs have attacked him for refusing to go sooner, and for his initial refusal to apologise personally for the crushing loss, others argue that the party should avoid a bitter blame game. In what appears to be a pitch for the top job, Phillips argues that the party must broaden its appeal so it can once again attract a coalition of support from both the working class and middle classes. But she goes out of her way to insist that she is not advocating a return to the approach of New Labour. “Some call me a Blairite because I’m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life. But I marched against Iraq, I didn’t even become an MP until eight years after he’d left parliament, so how does that fit?” She is severely critical of the way Corbyn and his supporters have seized control of the party machine and excluded those with different views. “The truth is there are corners of our party that have become too intolerant of challenge and debate,” she writes. “There is a clique who don’t care if our appeal has narrowed as long as they have control of the institutions and ideas of the party. “We’ve all got to discover the courage to ask the difficult questions about the future of our party and the future of the working class communities who need a Labour government.” Nandy also argues that the party has “lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent” and must reconnect with them by listening and becoming more “rooted in our communities”. Only that way could Labour understand the practical needs of working people and respond to them. Also writing in the Observer today, Corbyn says there is “no doubt” about the popularity of Labour’s policies. However, Nandy says that some of the manifesto made little sense. “Nationalising rail is a good, sound policy, but should we have staked so much of our campaign on that policy when so many of the towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it is one of the best sources of good jobs outside of London?” On Saturday senior Labour figures said that Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was already being promoted by the Corbyn circle as his favoured successor. Sharp differences of view were expressed over whether Corbyn should continue as leader for the next few months or go sooner. Peter Kyle, who held his Hove and Portslade seat comfortably, said action to purge the entire Corbyn leadership was needed immediately. Writing in the Observer, he accuses Corbyn and his inner circle of betraying Labour members with a “culture of authoritarianism, bullying, and organisational incompetence”. He adds: “We must move forward, fast. Tom Watson has gone, Jeremy is going, and Len McCluskey [the Unite general secretary] must follow.” Other MPs said Labour had to have a new leader in place before campaigning starts in Spring ahead of May’s local elections. But , also writing in this paper, Labour MPs Lucy Powell and Shabana Mahmood, who held their seats of Manchester Central and Birmingham Ladywood, urge the party not to indulge in a bitter blame game, and instead to work together to learn the lessons for the long term. “Our starting point for a Labour recovery can’t be to pick the things we like and blame the things that we don’t. Some want to say our defeat was all about Jeremy Corbyn, others that it was only Brexit. Both are wrong. It’s clear that our losses were about both and much, much more. “We must now undertake a real and meaningful review with everything on the table, and no no-go areas. It must start from a place of humility which acknowledges Labour got it wrong rather than the voters, with a process that involves the whole of our movement, and those who feel we’ve left them behind.” Angela Eagle, who retained the Merseyside seat of Wallasey, said there were many people at the top of the party, including senior officials and advisers, who needed to think seriously about whether it was credible for them to carry on after the election disaster. “There are a lot of people who need to reflect and consider their positions, not just the leadership in parliament.” Corbyn will face a difficult few days after parliament returns on Tuesday. He is expected to address a meeting of the parliamentary party that day, then taking part in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, before accompanying Johnson on the traditional walk from Commons to Lords on Thursday for the Queen’s speech."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/nov/28/who-won-the-general-election-climate-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-28T21:59:17Z","webTitle":"Who won the general election climate debate?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/who-won-the-general-election-climate-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/nov/28/who-won-the-general-election-climate-debate","fields":{"headline":"Who won the general election climate debate?","bodyText":"With Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refusing to take part, Channel 4’s climate debate was a pretty straightforward affair, with the leaders of the Greens, Labour, Plaid Cymru, Scottish National party and Liberal Democrats competing to outdo each other on climate promises, rather than attacking anyone’s record. Overall pitch Berry: Only the Greens will put the climate and biodiversity crises at the very top of the government’s priorities, and other parties are only taking these issues seriously now because the Greens have won the argument. Corbyn: Unlike the Tories, Labour has a climate plan and it will create huge numbers of jobs in a “green industrial revolution” encompassing offshore wind farms, housing upgrades, nationalised railways and energy, and a lot of new trees. Price: The Plaid Cymru leader made a strong pitch that Wales has been neglected by Westminster governments handing out infrastructure investment, which is vital to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon: Scotland is already a leader in onshore and offshore wind, and could go much further in renewable energy generation, as well as tree-planting and nature conservation. Swinson: The Liberal Democrats have traditionally been the strongest on green issues among the three main parties but have struggled to regain lost ground after taking part in the coalition, which failed to fulfil its promise to be “the greenest government ever”. Swinson’s commitments, for instance on achieving net zero only five years before the Tories, looked less impressive when compared with other parties. Best line Berry: The Greens have had the climate at the top of their agenda for years while the others are just catching up, Berry pointed out: “Do you trust them to get this done without more Greens in parliament?” Corbyn: “This election is the last chance to tackle our climate emergency.” Corbyn did a good job of showing that he knows the issues, even if he didn’t have answers for all of them. Price: “After Scotland, Wales has the best resources [for renewable energy]. Wales was the cradle of the industrial revolution – and can be of the next one.” The country famous for coal can generate renewable energy and green jobs. Sturgeon: “COP26 will be in Glasgow – Scotland will be leading the way.” Next year, a international conference called COP26, where governments from every country will gather to determine the fate of the Paris climate agreement, will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. Sturgeon made it clear she will make the most of that international stage, and the Tories may regret their decision to award host status to the city. Swinson: Pointed out that small contributions by individuals are not enough – we need systemic change, and only politicians can achieve that. “Making it easier and cheaper to make the right thing, so it becomes the obvious decision to make.” Strategy Berry: This debate was one for the Greens to shine, so in response to any commitment made by other parties – on how soon to reach net-zero carbon, on how much money to invest, on how to protect nature – Berry’s trump card was that the Greens would go further and faster. Corbyn: Labour put the “green industrial revolution” at the top of its manifesto, and Corbyn has a personal image for green living, from his allotment to his self-professed “miserable-ness” in refusing to turn on the heating. Corbyn would also seek international cooperation on the global problem of the climate. Price: Stressed Wales’s potential contribution and future growth from renewable energy. Sturgeon: Scotland has a strong story on renewable energy. Just don’t mention North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: Frequent flyer levy on anyone taking more than three international return flights a year. Worst moment Berry: Failed to explain why scrapping HS2 was a good idea, when calling for less flying. Corbyn: Defending nationalisation of the electricity grid, which Price suggested would divert investment from renewables, by claiming it would be easier to sell biogas back into the grid. Price: A rather feeble brag of claiming green credentials for changing his reusable nappies for his newborn son. Sturgeon: Refusing to directly address the question of North Sea oil and gas, preferring vague references to a “just transition” to low-carbon jobs. Swinson: Floundering while trying to explain why the Lib Dems’ target of net zero by 2045 was so much better than the Tories’ 2050 target. Unanswered questions Berry: Is it realistic to borrow £1tn over the next decade? Corbyn: Does the party back Heathrow expansion, which half of Labour MPs voted for, and nuclear power? Price: Can Wales make the transition from a former coal-based economy to low-carbon industry? Sturgeon: North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: The Lib Dem record in the coalition. Verdict Berry: Berry showed a depth of familiarity with the issues that is her party’s key selling point. Corbyn: Believable on these issues, and with a strong manifesto on the green industrial revolution. Price: Hammered home the point that Wales’s potential has been overlooked and undermined by Westminster. Sturgeon: SNP are comfortable on renewables and the natural environment, less so on the North Sea. Swinson: Struggling to reclaim what used to be an easy win for the Lib Dems in being one of the greenest parties – now looking outflanked by Labour. Loser Boris Johnson, represented by a melting ice block. The Tories’ decision not to engage on this vital issue shows they are just not interested in pitching to younger voters, who rate the environment as a leading concern. They have decided that the leave voters they are after won’t be basing their votes on this, and their climate plans don’t stand up to scrutiny."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/aug/05/morning-mail-twin-us-massacres-smiths-second-century-high-speed-rail-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-04T21:00:13Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Twin US massacres, Smith's second century, high-speed rail dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/05/morning-mail-twin-us-massacres-smiths-second-century-high-speed-rail-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/aug/05/morning-mail-twin-us-massacres-smiths-second-century-high-speed-rail-dream","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Twin US massacres, Smith's second century, high-speed rail dream","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 5 August. Top stories Two mass shootings in the US have left at least 29 people dead, with Donald Trump facing strong criticism. Twenty people were killed in the majority Latino border city of El Paso, Texas, including a woman shot while trying to save her baby. Federal authorities are investigating a potential hate crime and local prosecutors have charged a 21-year-old white man with murder. Less than 13 hours later another mass shooting took place in the Dayton, Ohio, leaving nine dead there and bringing the total injured from both shootings to at least 52. Police were examining a hate-riddled message on the website 8chan, posted about 20 minutes before Saturday’s Texas attack, in which the author expressed sympathy for a white nationalist massacre at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and which stated: “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” By late Sunday morning, Trump had not addressed the nation in person. Leading Democrats criticised him, linking the anti-immigrant rhetoric that characterised both his 2016 campaign and his tenure as president to the potential hate crime. Providers running ParentsNext claimed more than $350,000 in extra payments last financial year to put welfare recipients through in-house training courses. The figures, revealed in a departmental response to the Senate, suggest all 22 ParentsNext providers with registered training arms went on to bill taxpayers for participants to undertake courses run by their own organisations. The $350m welfare-to-work program for disadvantaged parents faces fresh criticism. A woman with cancer has become the first person to end her life under voluntary assisted dying laws in Victoria. Kerry Robertson, 61, died at a nursing home in Bendigo on 15 July. She was the first person to be granted the permit, having visited her specialist the day legislation came into effect. Her daughters Jacqui Hicks and Nicole Robertson described her death as a “beautiful, positive experience”. The sisters said it had reinforced their belief that anyone who was terminally ill and in intolerable pain deserved the choice of a voluntary assisted death. “It is the most compassionate, dignified and logical option for those suffering in the end stages of life,” Nicole Robertson said. World Russia plans to tow its first floating nuclear power station to the Arctic this month in a milestone for the country’s growing use of nuclear power in its northern expansion. But the station has raised safety concerns, with Greenpeace warning that it could become a “floating Chernobyl”. A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was thrown from the 10th-floor viewing platform at London’s Tate Modern. The child was taken to hospital by the air ambulance after being found on a fifth-floor roof and is in a critical condition.

Opinion and analysis As a young man Habiburahman fled oppression in his native Myanmar and lives, stateless, in Australia. Now he has written a book about his struggle – and his suffering people. “There has been much written about the Rohingya people of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma,” writes Gay Alcorn. “The Muslim ethnic group has been persecuted for generations, most recently from 2017, when 800,000 picked up whatever they could carry to flee to Bangladesh. But little has been written from the point of view of a Rohingya growing up in Myanmar – the daily humiliations, the struggle for survival, the fear, the stories whispered through generations to ensure they are not lost.” “We make Australia, we are all Australian,” says Nick Kalogeropoulos, who immigrated to Australia from Greece in 1976. He is talking to Neha Kale, who spoke to five people who immigrated to Australia during the last five decades. Kalogeropoulos recalls: “In Athens, I studied to be a computer programmer at night and worked as a framer during the day. When I came to Australia in 1976, I couldn’t speak English, so I worked in a factory. Forty years ago, there were no tables on the sidewalks in Australia. No one drank coffee, there were only milk bars. Back home, we said good morning. Here, we walk in the street, we don’t talk … When we first came here, it was racist, and we had a tough time.” Sport Australia have taken control of the first Ashes Test. At the end of the fourth day the outcome of the match is still unknown but it is certain England will not win it. Steve Smith achieved his second century of the match, a new accomplishment for the man, writes Barney Ronay, “who bats in a space of his own – no historical comparison required”. Lewis Hamilton has won F1’s Hungarian GP. “The race was gripping, tense and almost impossible to call until the final laps,” writes Giles Richards. Thinking time: ‘He had our hopes right up’ Nick Cleary is a man with big dreams. The would-be property developer from the southern highlands of NSW heads the Consolidated Land and Rail Australia consortium. Clara has sold bureaucrats and ministers on a vision so large it’s almost eye-watering: a high-speed rail network between Melbourne and Sydney that would open the way for not one but eight new cities, each between 200,0000 and 600,000 people, to be constructed along its route. They would rise from the paddocks over the next 50 years, taking the pressure off Sydney and Melbourne as workers moved to the regions, but still with access to highly paid jobs just an hour away by rail. Some of the new centres would be planned for the outskirts of existing regional towns, helping to revive their economies. “The policy on population has failed because we have failed to overcome the tyranny of distance,” Cleary says. “Between now and 2061 we are going to grow the population by 15 million. Our plan is to build cities at scale connected by high-speed rail.” But Cleary – who leads the consortium to which the federal government gave $8m of $20m earmarked to progress high-speed rail – has no expertise in major infrastructure projects, has been a bankrupt and was once a National party candidate. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald leads with the revelation that Australia is negotiating with the US to buy oil from its fuel reserve “under an emergency strategy to lower the risk of Australia plunging into an economic and national security crisis” and that Melania Trump is pushing the US president to make an official visit to Australia this year.

The Guardian understands the South Australian senator, who quit the Liberals in 2017 to form the Australian Conservatives party, is closely considering his future, and has canvassed the option of leaving the Senate before his term expires in 2022. Bernardi is said to be weighing up how he can best be “effective” in the parliament in his time remaining after he left open the possibility of rejoining the Coalition party room. If he quit before his term expired, he would open up a casual vacancy for the Liberal party in South Australia. Bernardi has long been a proponent of Australia adopting nuclear power, and could be a key vote in the parliament if the government decided to remove the ban on nuclear that exists in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act. He has not yet had any discussions with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about rejoining the party, but told Sky News on Tuesday that he was open to the idea. “I am open to having a conversation with the government about how best I can support their agenda, but I’m not compromising myself,” he said. “I do want to see this government succeed, so I’ll think about how best I can do that.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government’s Senate leader, Mathias Cormann, said it “was a matter for the Liberal party in South Australia” whether Bernardi rejoined the Liberals. “I would always like to see additional members in the Senate join the Liberal-National team, of course,” he said. If Bernardi rejoined the Coalition, the government would have 36 votes in the Senate, needing only three more from the crossbench to pass legislation. He has indicated he will back the government’s three-stage income tax cut plan and has voted consistently with the Coalition since he defected in 2017. At the 18 May election, his Australian Conservatives party won just over 16,000 first preference votes, compared to 53,000 for One Nation and 33,000 for the United Australia party. When he defected, fellow Liberals accused him of embarking on a vanity project, and a senior conservative, Peter Dutton, called the move a “betrayal”. “I think people will be angry about any defection, angry about the betrayal of the Liberal party values,” Dutton said.

Britain is “urgently” looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, the government said on Tuesday, with prime minister Rishi Sunak promising to remain in close contact on a call with Polish president Andrzej Duda as he expressed solidarity. Sunak tweeted late on Wednesday night: I reiterated the UK’s solidarity with Poland and expressed condolences for the victims. We will remain in close contact and continue to coordinate with our Nato allies.” Sunak added that he spoke with the foreign secretary and defence secretary. “We are urgently looking into reports of a missile strike in Poland and will support our allies as they establish what has happened. We are also coordinating with our international partners, including Nato,” he said. A readout of the call issued by his Downing Street office also said that Duda had updated Sunak on the Polish investigation efforts, with Sunak offering “any assistance needed to urgently establish what happened.” UK foreign minister James Cleverly earlier said that the UK was urgently looking into the reports, adding they were in contact with Poland and Nato allies. G7 leaders are arranging an emergency summit meeting on Wednesday in response to the explosion in Poland, the Kyodo news agency said, citing a Japanese government source. It will take place in Bali in Indonesia, where the G20 summit is already under way. It means the heads of government from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom will discuss the incident and possible consequences. All of them are members of Nato, apart from Japan. Reuters has said that a Japan and United Kingdom meeting scheduled for the same day has been put on hold. Here’s a tweet from US president Joe Biden, showing him on the phone to Poland’s president Andrzej Duda. Biden is in Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 summit. He is sat with national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Here’s a couple of photos from Przewodów that have come through on news wires, as an investigation into the explosion begins. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has said that the explosion in Przewodów was a “one-off incident” and there are “no indications” that it is going to happen again. Duda said it was “most-likely” a Russian-made rocket but “we do not have any conclusive evidence at the moment as to who launched this missile … this is all still under investigation at the moment.” He added it was likely Poland will active Nato’s article 4 at a meeting of Nato on Wednesday. This is from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has given a press conference where he has urged caution. Speaking to reporters, Morawiecki said security forces and international experts were in Przewodów, eastern Poland, where two people have been killed to try to determine the cause of the explosion. He repeated several already-announced measures, including an increased military readiness and talking to Nato allies about an article 4 meeting between member states. Warsaw will also step up monitoring of its airspace. The prime minister went on to ask for people to be restrained. “I call on all Poles to remain calm around this tragedy. Let’s be prudent, let’s not let ourselves be manipulated. “We need to be ready to face fake news, propaganda efforts.” This is an analysis from our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, on why the explosion is unlikely to trigger a military escalation between Nato and Russia. He writes: Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an “armed attack” envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. “‘Deliberate armed attack’ is a real thing,” Alberque said. “Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles ain’t it.” Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that – rather than any form of direct Nato involvement – would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. You can read his full piece here: The Polish foreign ministry has said that a “Russian-made missile” was responsible for killing two people in the eastern village of Przewodów on Tuesday afternoon. Foreign affairs spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said: “On 15 November 2022, massive shelling of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure by the armed forces of the Russian Federation was observed for many hours. “At 15:40 in the village of Przewodów … a Russian-made missile fell, killing two citizens of the republic of Poland.” The statement said that the Russian ambassador to Poland has also been summoned to give an explanation (see 11:10pm). The Polish foreign minister has summoned the Russian ambassador to Poland for an explanation of the events connected to the explosion in Przewodów. In a statement on Poland’s government’s website, a spokesperson said: “The minister of foreign affairs, Zbigniew Rau summoned the ambassador of the Russian federation to the ministry of foreign affairs and demanded immediate detailed explanations.” The US president, Joe Biden, has offered Poland’s leader, Andrzej Duda, the US’s “full support for and assistance with Poland’s investigation”, Reuters reports. In a telephone call, the Polish president gave Biden an update on the inquiry into the explosion that killed two people, and in turn Biden said the US had an “ironclad” commitment to Nato. The full readout provided by the White House said: “President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening. “President Duda described Poland’s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. “President Biden offered full U.S support for and assistance with Poland’s investigation. President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to Nato. “The two leaders said that they and their teams should remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.” The US president has also spoken by phone to the Nato general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg. Duda has spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards: “We exchanged available information and are clarifying all the facts … all of Europe and the world must be fully protected from terrorist Russia.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russian missile attacks on Tuesday caused shutdowns in two of the country’s nuclear power plants. In an address to the nation, he said: “As a result of the strikes, several nuclear reactors at two plants were automatically disabled. These consequences were calculated, and the enemy knew exactly what it was doing.” He said that power has been restored to 8m homes after blackouts caused by the latest bombardment. “About 10 million Ukrainians were disconnected after the terrorist attack. Supply to eight million consumers has already been restored. Power engineers and repairmen will work all night,” he tweeted. UK foreign secretary James Cleverley has said the government is “urgently” looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland and is in contact with the government in Poland. “We are urgently looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, and are in contact with our Polish friends and Nato allies,” he said on Twitter. Here’s what we know so far, as investigators look into an explosion in Przewodów, a village near the border between Poland and Ukraine on Tuesday, which killed two people. Stray missiles are feared to have exploded in Poland, killing two agricultural workers in a village near its eastern border. It came as Russia launched a 100-missile attack on Ukraine, causing damage to infrastructure that left 7m homes without supplies. It has also had an impact on power supply in neighbouring Moldova. It is unclear whether the explosion was directly caused by a missile fired by Russia, or whether it is as a result of a Ukrainian anti-missile defence system shooting down a Russian missile. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, held an emergency meeting of a government committee on national security and defence matters. Government spokesperson Piotr Müller said that Warsaw had raised its level of military readiness in the aftermath of the incident. Müller said the government was calling for a meeting to take place between Nato members. It would be possibly under article 4 of Nato’s treaty, which says they “will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened”. Russia has denied any involvement. The defence ministry said in a statement: “Russian firepower has launched no strikes at the area between Ukrainian-Polish border.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he has “no information” about the situation in Poland. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it represents “a very significant escalation”. His foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called for more air defence assistance, fighter jets and a Nato summit to stop further escalation. We will continue to provide updates throughout the evening. Nato ambassadors will meet on Wednesday at the request of Poland on the basis of the alliance’s article 4, two European diplomats have told Reuters. According to article 4 of the alliance’s founding treaty, members can raise any issue of concern, especially related to the security of a member country. Investigations continue into the circumstances around an explosion in Przewodów, near Poland’s border with Ukraine that killed two people. One of the diplomats said the alliance would act cautiously and needed time to verify how exactly the incident happened. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda is due to speak to US president Joe Biden, who is in Bali for the G20 summit, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the coming hours as they react to the explosion in Przewodów. A White House statement said: “POTUS has been briefed on the reports out of Poland and will be speaking with president Andrzej Duda of Poland shortly.” Poland’s government spokesperson Piotr Muller told a press conference that the government was considering whether to trigger article 4 in the aftermath of the explosion in Przewodów. It would mean Nato members would consult on further action. Article 4 of the Nato treaty covers the scenario where a member state feels threatened by another country or a terrorist organisation. The treaty clause says: “The parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.” The 30 member states then start formal consultations at the request of the threatened member. The talks look at whether a threat exists and how to counter it, with decisions arrived at unanimously. Article 4 does not, however, mean that there will be direct pressure to act. This consultation mechanism has been triggered several times in Nato’s history. One example is one year ago, when Turkish soldiers were killed in an attack from Syria. In that case Nato decided to consult, but did not take any action. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for a Nato summit to stop Russian attacks, and has repeated a request for fighter jets to be sent to the country. He tweeted: “Ukraine reaffirms its full solidarity with Poland and stands ready to provide any necessary support. Collective response to Russian actions must be tough and principled. “Among immediate actions: a Nato summit with Ukraine’s participation to craft further joint actions which will force Russia to change its course on escalation, providing Ukraine with modern aircraft such as F-15 and F-16, as well as air defense systems, so that we can intercept any Russian missiles. Today, protecting Ukraine’s skies means protecting Nato.” The general secretary of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg has said he has spoken to the Polish president Andrzej Duda after the explosion earlier this evening. He said that Nato is “monitoring the situation and allies are closely consulting”. “It is important all facts are established,” he added. The Polish government spokesperson Piotr Muller has just given a press conference in the capital Warsaw, where he said the government was raising the military’s level of readiness in response to the explosion near its border with Ukraine. Speaking to cameras, Muller confirmed that two people had been killed earlier on Tuesday. He told reporters that the government was considering whether to trigger article 4, which would mean a meeting would take place of Nato members after their “territorial integrity, political independence or security” has been threatened. There is a lot of concern that the explosion in Poland may constitute a breach of Nato’s article 5, if it’s found that it is because of a Russian attack. For those not well versed in Nato’s founding treaty, article 5 is focused on collective defence and written at a time when the bloc was under threat from an attack by the former Soviet Union. Nato’s website describes it as Collective defence means that an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies. Article 5 has only ever been triggered once by Nato since it was signed in 1949, the day after the 11 September 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center buildings and Pentagon in the US. There is no automatic trigger process for it. Nato would have to choose to enact it. There is no indication at the moment that this is likely, and Poland is still investigating the circumstances behind the explosion. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary during the first of Joe Biden’s administrations, has tweeted this view while we wait for more information. Latvia has announced it will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to assess the security situation, given reports of Russian missiles crossing into Poland. Along with the announcement, Latvia’s prime minister added that the meeting is “to be ready for further action,” reported Reuters. Germany has said that it is monitoring reports that Russian rockets crossed into Poland, adding that it is in contact with Poland and other Nato members, reported Reuters. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock posted to Twitter about the reports, writing: Here is a full translation of Zelenskiy’s remarks on Russian missiles reportedly crossing into Poland Today, what we we warned about long ago has happened. We talked about it. Terror is not limited to our national borders. It has already spread to the territory of Moldova. And today, Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died. Please accept condolences from all Ukrainian brothers! How many times has Ukraine said that the terrorist state will not be limited to our country? Poland, the Baltic states... It’s only a matter of time before Russian terror goes further. It is necessary to put the terrorist in place! The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be to everyone who can be reached by Russian missiles. Hitting missiles on NATO territory... This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a very significant escalation. We must act. And I want to say now to all our Polish brothers and sisters... Ukraine will always support you! Terror will not break free people! Victory is possible when there is no fear! You and I don’t have it. I want to thank all partners who helped protect the sky. In particular, our NASAMS systems worked well today: ten hits out of ten launches. As of this hour, more than 70 missiles and ten attack drones have been shot down. I thank all our American and European friends who helped us to ensure this result. Thank you to all our soldiers of the “Southern”, “Center”, “East” and “West” air commands, as well as air defense units of the Ground Forces. Thanks to all our rescuers, our energy workers, who will work around the clock to restore normal life for Ukrainians. Restoration work has begun across the country. We will get through this too. We will restore everything. Russia opposes itself to the world. Russia loses on the battlefield. Russia is terrorizing us and everyone it can reach. Let’s do everything to stop it! Nato has now commented on reports of Russian missiles hitting Poland. From a Nato official: We are looking into these reports and closely coordinating with our Ally Poland. An advisor for Zelenskiy has called the reported strikes on Poland deliberate and a “disguised mistake” from Russia. From Mykhailo Podolyak via Twitter: Volodymyr Zelenskiy called reports of Russian missiles hitting Nato member Poland “a very significant escalation”, adding that action is needed, reported Reuters. The US state department has called reports of Russian missiles hitting Poland “incredibly concerning”, reports Reuters. State department spokesperson Vedant Patel said to reporters that the US is working to understand more about the explosion and determine appropriate steps. Patel added that the US is discussing with the Polish government and other partners about the reports. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian missiles struck Poland, reported Reuters, as the exact cause of the explosion remains unconfirmed. More on his remarks coming soon. Here is the latest on what we know about reports of stray missiles crossing into Poland: Stray Russian missiles were feared to have crossed into Poland on Tuesday, in what would be the first time Nato territory has been struck during the Ukraine war, as the Kremlin unleashed an intense attack on Ukraine that left 7m homes without power. Two people were killed in an explosion in an eastern Polish village, prompting the government in Warsaw to hold an emergency meeting – while the 100-missile attack on Ukraine was so serious that power supplies in a third country, Moldova, were also cut. Hungry also convened a meeting with its defence council, as several European countries posted messages of solidarity and promises to defend Nato territories. Several US agencies, including the Pentagon and National Security Council, have said that they cannot confirm reports of Russian strikes on Poland. The White House has also said this, adding that it is working with Russia to gather more information. The White House said that it could not confirm reports of stray Russian missiles, announcing that it is working with Poland to gather more information on recent reports, reports Reuters. The US National Security Council has also said that it cannot confirm reports of Russian missiles crossing into Poland, writing that it is working to gather more information. From NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson: The Russian ministry of defence has denied that it has launched missiles at the border between Poland and Ukraine. In a statement posted on its Telegram channel, it said the clams were “deliberate provocation to escalate the situation”. They added: “Russian firepower has launched no strikes at the area between Ukrainian-Polish border. “The wreckage published by Polish mass media from the scene in Przewodów have no relation to Russian firepower.” Lithuania has joined other Nato countries in posting their support of Poland. Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda posted a message about the reported strike on Twitter, writing: Mariusz Gierszewski, the reporter for Poland’s ZET Radio who initially wrote that stray Russian rockets had hit Poland, tweeted an update saying that the remains of a shot-down rocket were probably what hit eastern Poland. Gierszewski tweeted: My sources in the services say that what hit Przewodowo is most likely the remains of a rocket shot down by the armed forces of Ukraine. A senior White House official further remarked that there was uncertainty about what had happened amid reports of stray Russian missiles hitting Poland. From NBC News’s Kelly O’Donnell: Below is a map of where the reported strikes happened, hitting the Polish village of Przewodow on the country’s eastern side. The US Pentagon said today that it could not confirm reports that two Russian missiles had crossed into Poland and killed two people, reports Reuters. A Pentagon spokesperson, Patrick Ryder, gave the update during a news briefing on Tuesday: We are aware of the press reports alleging that two Russian missiles have struck a location inside Poland near the Ukraine border. I can tell you that we don’t have any information at this time to corroborate those reports and are looking into this further. More on Russian missiles crossing into Poland, from the Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo Some analysts suggested the missiles’ intended target may have been Lviv. According to media reports, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has also called for a defence council. Moldova was also affected by Russia’s massive missile attack today, causing electricity disruption in the country. Estonia is the latest European country to post about Russian missiles reportedly crossing into Nato member Poland. Estonia’s foreign ministry posted a message of concern and solidarity on Twitter, writing: Hungarian officials also announced that they will convene their defense council, government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs posted to Twitter: The Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, has posted on Twitter about Russian missiles reportedly crossing into Poland, writing: My condolences to our Polish brothers in arms. Criminal Russian regime fired missiles which target not only Ukrainian civilians but also landed on NATO territory in Poland. Latvia fully stands with Polish friends and condemns this crime. More on reports of two stray Russian missiles that hit a village in eastern Poland. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has reportedly called an urgent meeting with a government committee on national security and defence matters, reports Reuters, citing a government spokesperson on Twitter. The Associated Press further reported that a US intelligence official confirmed Russian missiles crossed into Poland, killing two people. Stay tuned for further updates. It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia has launched waves of missile strikes across Ukraine even as G20 leaders – including its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov – met in Bali. Ukraine’s authorities said it was another planned attack aimed at the country’s energy infrastructure facilities. Seven million homes have been left without power. Ukraine’s public broadcaster reported that the strikes have targeted Kyiv, Kyiv region, Kharkiv city as well as Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Cherkassy, Odesa, and Chernihiv regions. The strikes follow Russia’s retreat from Kherson and the west bank of the Dnipro River last week. Russia fired “around 100 missiles” at cities across Ukraine, according to Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force command. At least one person has died after three residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv, were hit, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. He said the buildings were in Kyiv’s Pechersk district, a residential area just north of the presidential administration. Klitschko said medics and rescue workers were on their way to the scenes. Widespread power outages are reported across the country as a result of the attack. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said the attack was a response to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the G20 on Tuesday. Zelenskiy called on the leaders to support Ukraine to end it on its terms – the primary being that Russian troops leave all of Ukraine, including the areas it occupied in 2014. Zelenskiy is calling for an international conference to “cement key element of the postwar security architecture” and prevent a recurrence of “Russian aggression”. A senior US intelligence official said Russian missile attacks on Tuesday crossed into Nato member Poland, killing two people. Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an urgent meeting of a committee for national security and defence affairs, the government spokesperson Piotr Müller said. Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, said parts of the country were also suffering from power outages as a result of today’s Russian strikes on Ukraine. Officials said the strikes earlier today caused the automatic safety shutdown of systems that carry electricity supplies to Moldova. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said that Zelenskiy’s statement that there will be no “Minsk-3” deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow. In Bali, Lavrov told the media that “all the problems are on the Ukrainian side, which categorically refuses any negotiations and puts forward conditions that are obviously unrealistic and inadequate in this situation”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, responded to Lavrov’s remarks by blaming the continuation of the war on the Russian minister’s “public manipulation and unwillingness to stop murdering”. Lavrov also told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity. Matilda Bogner, head of the monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the “vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence. On the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported “credible allegations” of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses. Germany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has awarded the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol the titles of “cities of military glory”. Both lie in areas of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to have annexed. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has criticised Ireland for, she claims, moving away from its traditional military neutrality, in actions being “cheered on by its British neighbour”. The head of football’s world governing body, Fifa, issued a plea on Tuesday for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup. Gianni Infantino called for all sides to use the tournament as a “positive trigger” to work towards a resolution. Two people have been killed in an explosion in Przewodów, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine, according to local firefighters. Reuters has cited Lukasz Kucy, an officer on duty at a nearby firefighters’ post, as saying: Firefighters are on the spot, it’s not clear what has happened. It was reported earlier that two stray missiles hit Przewodów, killing two people. A senior US intelligence official said Russian missiles crossed into Nato member Poland, killing two people, reports the Associated Press. Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an urgent meeting of a committee for national security and defence affairs, the government spokesperson, Piotr Müller, said on Twitter. Müller did not mention what the committee was due to discuss but local media reported that the meeting may be related to a reported explosion on the Polish border with Ukraine. Russia shelled cities and energy facilities across Ukraine on Tuesday, including Lviv, a city in the west of the country close to Poland. Seven million homes have been left without power after Russian missile strikes hit cities across Ukraine earlier today. Some 15 energy facilities were damaged as a result of the attacks, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office. He added: Our power engineers are now doing everything to reconnect the power supply as soon as possible. In Lyiv, in the west of the country, its mayor said 80% of the city was without power after it came under attack. The western Ternopil region said 90% of users were cut off. The Dnipropetrovsk region’s military administration said an energy facility in Kryvyi Rih had been hit, creating a “complicated” situation for the grid. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said at least half of the city’s residents were without power. Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, said parts of the country were suffering from power outages as a result of today’s Russian strikes on Ukraine. Writing on Twitter, Popescu said: Every bomb falling on Ukraine is also affecting Moldova and our people. We call on Russia to stop the destruction now. Officials said the strikes earlier today caused the automatic safety shutdown of systems that carry electricity supplies to Moldova. Dozens of settlements were left without electricity as a result, they added. In response, Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, said: We strongly condemn this new attack, the largest since the beginning of the war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has condemned Russia’s missile attacks and vowed to stand with Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. In a tweet, Blinken said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, “demonstrated leadership again today by making clear he is prepared for diplomacy toward a just end to the war Russia started”. The response from Moscow “was another wave of missiles”, he said, adding: These attacks will not break Ukraine’s will – we will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyal said Russia’s latest missile attacks have “shown their so-called willingness to negotiate”. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has praised Russia’s “rational” and “responsible” attitude to nuclear war during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, at the G20 summit. Wang was quoted by the state news agency Xinhua as saying: China noticed that Russia has recently reaffirmed the established position that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’, which shows Russia’s rational and responsible attitude. The Chinese minister also said Beijing was pleased to see Moscow signal its willingness to engage in talks over Ukraine and agree to resume the Black Sea grain initiative, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. China was “willing to work with Russia to push forward their high-level exchanges and communication in various fields, deepen bilateral practical cooperation and facilitate personnel exchanges”, Wang was quoted as saying. Ukrainian authorities have said the latest wave of Russian missile strikes was targeted at the country’s infrastructure facilities. The energy situation across Ukraine has been left “critical” as a result of the strikes, according to the deputy head of the presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Kyiv’s city state administration has said that the power blackouts mean that the country’s air raid sirens do not work, the FT’s Christopher Miller says. The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has said Russia’s latest missile attacks on Ukraine demonstrate President Vladimir Putin’s “weakness”. Ukraine is currently experiencing “major internet disruption”, with live metrics showing that national connectivity is at 67% of previous levels, according to the internet monitoring group Netblocks. Most regions of the country have been affected by a countrywide power outage amid intense Russian missile attacks targeting critical infrastructure, the group said. Kyiv authorities said four missiles were intercepted by air defences but those that passed through hit two multi-storey residential buildings in the Pechersk district. Footage released by Ukraine showed the aftermath of the strike. The area is a few miles north of the presidential palace. Germany has completed construction of its first floating terminal to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) which its economy minister said would be vital to securing energy supplies to the country over the winter months. Robert Habeck described the first of five planned floating terminals at the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven as being “a central building block for the security of our energy supplies this coming winter” as Germany races to find alternatives to Russian pipeline gas which it had relied on for years until supplies were halted in conjunction with the invasion of Ukraine. The government is working on introducing a total of five swimming LNG terminals to German ports, each with a capacity of at least five billion m3 per year. The terminal at Wilhelmshaven, and another at Brunsbüttel, are due to be operational at the turn of the year. Germany used to receive nearly a third of its natural gas supplies via pipeline from Russia, before Moscow started reducing the flow following its invasion of Ukraine, in an apparent reaction to sanctions placed on it, and turned off supplies completely in late August. My colleague Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv writes that authorities are asking residents to stay in shelters after another explosion was reported in the Ukrainian capital. Here are some of the latest images from Kyiv following a wave of Russian missile attacks across the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned Ukrainians they could face more Russian missile strikes today, but said the country would survive. In a video shared on Telegram, Zelenskiy said 85 missiles were launched against Ukraine on Tuesday and a further 20 were expected to hit the country. He warned residents to stay in shelters, adding: I know that the (missile) strikes turned off energy in many places … We are working, we will restore everything, we will survive. The US “strongly condemns” the latest wave of Russian missile attacks against Ukraine, the White House has said. In a statement, it said today’s attacks “will serve to only deepen the concerns among the G-20 about the destabilising impact of Putin’s war”. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said: The United States and our allies and partners will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself, including air defense systems. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia has launched waves of missile strikes across Ukraine even as G20 leaders – including its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov – met in Bali. Ukraine’s authorities said it was another planned attack aimed at the country’s energy infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s public broadcaster reported that the strikes have targeted Kyiv, Kyiv region, Kharkiv city as well as Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskiy, Lviv, Cherkassy, Odesa, and Chernihiv regions. The strikes follow Russia’s retreat from Kherson and the west bank of the Dnipro River last week. Russia fired “around 100 missiles” at cities across Ukraine, according to Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force command. At least one person has died after three residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv, were hit, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, responded to Lavrov’s remarks by blaming the continuation of the war on the Russian minister’s “public manipulation and unwillingness to stop murdering”. Lavrov also told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity. Matilda Bogner, head of the monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the “vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence. On the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported “credible allegations” of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses. Germany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said. Russian president Vladimir Putin has awarded the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol the titles of “cities of military glory”. Both lie in areas of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to have annexed. Russian’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has criticised Ireland for, she claims, moving away from its traditional military neutrality, in moves being “cheered on by its British neighbour”. The head of football’s world governing body, Fifa, issued a plea on Tuesday for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup. Gianni Infantino called for all sides to use the tournament as a “positive trigger” to work towards a resolution. Another explosion has been heard in Kyiv in the last few minutes. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force said Russia fired around 100 missiles in a countrywide strike. The official said the strikes were aimed at critical infrastructure facilities, but residential buildings were also hit. The Dutch foreign minister Wopke Hoekstra, who is in Kyiv today, said the latest series of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine were a “great motivator to stand shoulder to shoulder” with Kyiv. Speaking from an air raid shelter, Hoekstra said the shelling showed Russia was prepared to use “criminal means” in its war with Ukraine. He added: There can only be one answer to that: that is continue, continue to support Ukraine, continue to send weapons, continue to humanitarian aid. As the Netherlands, we will do that, together with other countries. The Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko has posted some pictures of a Kyiv subway station as air raid sirens are heard across the capital. The energy situation in Ukraine is “critical” following a wave of attacks that damaged energy infrastructure, the deputy head of the president’s office said. The national grid operator, Ukrenergo, said the worst damage was in northern and central regions and that emergency power outages for “all categories of consumers” had been introduced in those areas. It also announced special emergency outages in Kyiv. A statement from Ukrenergo on Telegram said: The (Russians) are again trying to turn off the lights in the country. Energy infrastructure facilities have been damaged during a new large-scale missile attack. The attack is still ongoing, we cannot yet determine the full extent of the damage, there is “incoming” to our infrastructure in all regions of the country, but the most difficult situation is in the northern and central regions. In this regard, emergency shutdowns of all categories of consumers have been introduced there in full. In the city of Kyiv, special emergency shutdown schedules have been introduced. Please stay in the shelter and thank you for your understanding. Please share this information with those who do not use social media! At least one person has died as a result of a Russian missile attack on a residential building in Kyiv, according to the city’s military administration. This is from the Ukrainian culture ministry’s centre for strategic communication: While Russian missiles have struck energy infrastructure across Ukraine today, the RIA Novosti news agency reports that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has awarded the titles “cities of military glory” to two of the cities that Russia continues to occupy. RIA states: Melitopol and Mariupol were awarded the titles of cities of military glory, the corresponding decrees were signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The documents contain an identical wording – “for the courage, steadfastness and mass heroism shown by the defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the fatherland.” Melitopol and Mariupol both lie in occupied areas that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Last week, Russia was forced to withdraw from the city of Kherson, the only regional capital that the nine-month Russian military campaign had so far managed to capture. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has posted to Twitter a response to today’s attacks by Russia, which have taken place even as Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been attending the G20 summit in Bali and portraying Ukraine as an obstacle to peace. [See 12.06 GMT] Kuleba says: Russian missiles are killing people and ruining infrastructure across Ukraine right now. This is what Russia has to say on the issue of peace talks. Stop proposing Ukraine to accept Russian ultimatums! This terror can only be stopped with the strength of our weapons and principles. My colleague Isobel Koshiw is one of those left without power following the attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure today by Russia. At least half of Kyiv is without electricity, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. He has posted to Telegram to say: Due to a massive missile attack, on the order of the national electric power company Ukrenergo, the energy industry started emergency power outages throughout Ukraine. In particular, in the capital. This is a necessary step to balance the power system and avoid equipment accidents. Schedules of stabilisation shutdowns are currently not in effect! In the capital, at least half of the customers are without electricity. Russian’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has criticised Ireland for, she claims, moving away from its traditional military neutrality, in moves being “cheered on by its British neighbour.”. In a statement published by Russia’s foreign ministry, Zakharova says: We have noted the heated debate in Ireland regarding the country’s military neutrality in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. Notably, the opposition is criticising the government for its decision to involve Ireland in the European Union’s combat training mission to train service personnel for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This initiative was called another official step to draw Dublin into EU and subsequently Nato military activity that in the long run would completely demolish the idea of Ireland’s traditional military neutrality. We have to state that the right-centrist coalition now ruling Ireland is moving to virtually erode a constitutional ban on involving the state in military conflicts. Ireland’s seemingly illogical desire to destroy its state pillars is actually part of Washington and London’s efforts to consolidate the Western bloc along military lines. After Finland and Sweden join Nato, only a few countries, including Ireland, would remain outside the alliance. Zakharova went on to accuse Ireland of destroying “bilateral political, economic and cultural ties” and “hampering the normal operation of the Russian embassy in Dublin”. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to Telegram to say that emergency electricity shutdowns have been introduced into the region as a result of “enemy attacks in Sumy and the region”. Ukraine’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has described today’s Russian strikes as Russia “spitting in the face” of fellow attendees at the G20. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has tweeted: “As night follows day, Russia follows up humiliating withdrawal from Kherson with missile strikes on energy infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere. The British are waiting it out alongside Ukrainian residents.” There are also power supply problems in the Lviv region following a Russian strike. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has updated residents to say: The enemy struck a critical energy infrastructure facility in the Lviv region. In Lviv, there are problems with electricity supply, interruptions in the work of mobile operators. Stay in shelters! The danger still continues. Ihor Terekhov, mayor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram to say that a critical infrastructure facility has been hit by a Russian strike. He writes: Arrivals at a critical infrastructure facility. There is no information about the victims at the moment. Due to damage to the facility, there are problems with power supply. Stopped ground electric transport, metro. Power engineers and public utilities are doing everything to normalise the life of Kharkiv as soon as possible. The news comes as Russia has launched a wave of attacks across Ukraine, with explosions reported in Lviv, and firefighters on the scene in Kyiv where residential buildings have been hit. Ukraine’s presidential aide Andriy Yermak described the attacks as a direct response to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s video address to the G20. The attacks come as Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, attends the G20 summit in Bali, where earlier he told the media that “all the problems are on the Ukrainian side, which categorically refuses any negotiations and puts forward conditions that are obviously unrealistic and inadequate in this situation”. Here is another image we have been sent over the newswires of firefighters working in Kyiv in the aftermath of a Russian attack that struck a residential area. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A Brink has described the series of attacks launched today by Russia on Ukraine as “another round of cruel attacks”. She has tweeted to say she is thinking of “colleagues, neighbours, and friends here in Kyiv and across Ukraine. We will continue to stand with Ukrainians who have stayed strong in the face of Russia’s needless onslaught for months – and with those fighting to defend Ukraine.” Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has also posted to Telegram, saying “Explosions are heard in Lviv. Everyone stay in shelters!” Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, has posted a short update to Telegram to say: “The occupiers strike Kharkiv! Stay in shelters.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has posted to Telegram to confirm “Another hit in the Pechersk district. Multi-storey building.” Another explosion has been reported in Kyiv, NBC News’ Molly Hunter writes. Russia launched yet another mass strike across Ukraine on Tuesday. Ukraine’s public broadcaster said the strikes targeted Kyiv, Kyiv region, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipro and Chernihiv. At least two residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv, were hit, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. He said the buildings were in Kyiv’s Pechersk district, a residential area just north of the presidential administration. Kyiv city council stated that a total of four rockets were intercepted by air defence. The city of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava and Cherkassy regions have been hit, according to their respective city and regional heads. Air defence systems are working to shoot down incoming missiles in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Vinnytsia as well as Poltava, according to their regional heads. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, has posted a video reportedly showing an apartment building on fire after explosions were reported in Kyiv. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on Telegram that two residential buildings had been hit in the Pechersk district of the capital, a residential area north of the presidential administration. “Several missiles were shot down by air defence over Kyiv. Medics and rescuers at the scene of the hits,” added Klitschko. Kyivians reported on Twitter hearing fire engines rushing to the scene. Two residential buildings have been hit with Russian missiles in Kyiv’s Pechersk district, according to the city’s mayor Vitali Klitschko. In a statement, Klitschko said: Attack on the capital. According to preliminary information, two residential buildings were hit in the Pechersk district. Several missiles were shot down by air defence over Kyiv. Medics and rescuers at the scene of the hits. The city’s military administration reports that four rockets were shot down, according to the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, Anton Gerashchenko. At least two explosions were heard and smoke could be seen rising over Kyiv, according to a Reuters correspondent in the Ukrainian capital. The explosions followed air raid sirens across the country hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered his G20 summit video address. The cause of the explosions is unclear but Andriy Yermak, chief of the presidential staff, tweeted that Moscow had responded to Zelenskiy’s speech “with a new missile attack”. The Ukrainian newspaper Kyiv Post also said the city had been struck by Russian forces. A series of explosions have been heard in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, according to reports. This is from Christopher Miller of the Financial Times: And from the Kyiv Independent: Over the last week, several media reports have claimed that the west may be trying to pressure Ukraine into ceding territory in exchange for a ceasefire. Some of Ukraine’s western allies are reportedly worried about the economic consequences of a protracted war. Italy’s La Repubblica reported that some Nato allies envisaged talks beginning after Ukraine recaptured Kherson. On Friday, Ukraine announced Russian forces had fled the right bank of Kherson, but they still occupy the left side. In response, President Zelenskiy and his aides adamantly ruled out talks, saying that first Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and the country’s international borders are re-established. Speaking to the G20 summit, Zelenskiy said there would be no Minsk-3, referring to the failed peace accords Ukraine signed under pressure in 2015. The ceasefire was never adhered to by either side and the political points of the agreement would have given Russia’s proxies in eastern Ukraine a right to vote over Ukrainian legislation, if implemented. The latest public pushback of the allies pressure to conclude the war in the near future has come from Ukraine’s army chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. On Monday, in a phone call with his US counterpart, Gen Mark Milley, Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine’s military would not accept a compromise solution to the war. I have assured (Milley) that we will fight until we have no strength. Our objective is to liberate the whole Ukrainian land from Russian occupation. We will not stop on this path under any circumstances. Ukrainian soldiers will accept no negotiations, agreements or compromise solutions. The only term for negotiation: Russia must leave all the occupied territories. Zaluzhnyi further informed Milley of Ukraine’s efforts to defend its northern border with Belarus. In this last month, satellites have detected a build-up of Russian forces and equipment in Belarus. Zaluzhnyi said that despite facing “tremendous” resistance from Russian troops, Ukraine’s forces were pushing to retake the final slither of occupied Kharkiv region. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s forces were defending against a four-pronged offensive in Donetsk region and consolidating their recent advances in Kherson by building defences. A western official warned that fighting in Ukraine was likely to descend into a grind throughout 2023 following Russia’s retreat from Kherson in which neither side is able to achieve a military breakthrough. The gloomy assessment - if proved accurate - would ultimately favour Russia because it occupies a large swathe of Ukrainian territory and comes amid warnings of ammunition shortages on both sides and the impending onset of winter. The western official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said: If we take a big picture overall as we go into 2023, we are still expecting the grind. We are still expecting it to be largely static, and we still expect neither side to particularly win or lose, and really that extends all the way through 2023. The official also stressed that any predictions about the future course of the war remain difficult to make, not least because of the offensive creativity of the Ukrainian forces. “The Ukrainians continue to surprise us,” they added, a reference to autumn successes near Kharkiv and most recently in Kherson. Munitions supply is deemed to be a significant limiting factor for both sides, who are now deemed to be engaged in a race to rebuild stockpiles ahead of next spring. Ukrainian estimates that Russia has reduced its stock of Iskander cruise missiles to around 120 from around 900 pre-war, are thought to be accurate, officials indicated. Russia successfully evacuated around 20,000 from the Kherson pocket in the period running up to the formal withdrawal announcement last week, and the west believes very few were left behind. Unlike previous withdrawals from Kyiv in April and near Kharkiv in September, it was relatively well organised and the number of abandoned vehicles was “in the tens not the hundreds”. The official said they believed it will be very difficult for Ukraine to cross the Dnipro en masse - despite reports of raids across the river - where the Russians have built what were described as relatively old-fashioned but effective fortifications. Meanwhile, they were monitoring whether Russia would try to move several thousand troops from Kherson to the Donbas and whether “Russia will be able to generate an offensive striking force in the Donbas region”. Russian attacks have been halted for months by well organised Ukrainian defences. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed “deep concern” over Russia’s choice to continue its war in Ukraine, the French presidency said after a meeting between Macron and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. In a statement, Macron’s office added: The consequences of this conflict go beyond Europe’s borders and should be overcome with close cooperation between France and China. Macron and Xi agreed it was urgent to de-escalate the conflict and reaffirmed their position on preventing the use of nuclear weapons, the French presidency added. Macron tweeted that he and Xi both “call for respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty”. However, Beijing’s readout of the pair’s meeting made no mention of Ukraine until the final paragraph, which said: President Xi made the point that China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent; China stands for ceasefire, cessation of the conflict and peace talks. We are in Posad-Pokrovske, a frontline village in the Kherson region. Russian and Ukrainian forces took and retook control of this village at least seven times. As a result, Posad-Pokrovske was razed to the ground. Russia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from Kherson in part to avoid giving President Joe Biden a political win ahead of the US midterm elections last week, according to a report. The US has intelligence that senior Russian officials discussed the US midterm elections as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one source told CNN. The intelligence signals Russia has a continued interest in influencing the US political landscape, and comes after President Biden suggested the timing of Moscow’s withdrawal announcement was more than just coincidence. At a press conference last Wednesday, Biden said: I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military. Russian-installed civil servants in Nova Kakhovka, the second-largest city in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, have left due to intensified shelling, according to officials. The city’s Russian-installed administration said: Employees of the Nova Kakhovka city state administration and state and municipal institutions also left the city and were relocated to safe areas in the region. Here’s more detail from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s comments to reporters at the G20 summit earlier, where he said Ukraine’s conditions for restarting talks with Moscow were “unrealistic”. Lavrov said: All problems are with the Ukrainian side, which is categorically refusing negotiations and putting forward conditions that are obviously unrealistic. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has ruled out peace negotiations with Moscow as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power, after the Russian leader proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions in September. Lavrov said western countries are “well aware that this process is hindered by Ukraine, which, including through laws, by Zelenskiy’s decree, bans negotiations with the Russian Federation”, adding: We want to see concrete evidence that the west is seriously interested in disciplining Zelenskiy and explaining to him that this cannot continue, that this is not in the interests of the Ukrainian people. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelenskiy, responded to Lavrov’s remarks by blaming the continuation of the war on the Russian minister’s “public manipulation and unwillingness to stop murdering”. Speaking at the G20 summit, Lavrov also accused western leaders of trying to “politicise” a joint declaration, a draft of which states that “most” members strongly condemn the war in Ukraine. He said: Our Western colleagues tried in every way to make that declaration politicised and tried to push through language that implied condemning the actions of the Russian Federation on behalf of the entire G20, which includes us. Asked about reports that G20 leaders could agree to a draft communique rejecting the era of war and condemning the use of nuclear weapons, a spokesperson for Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, replied: Obviously we want any communique, should it be agreed, to be as strong as possible, recognising that the G20 is a different forum to the G7 and that it’s largely focused on economic issues. But I wouldn’t comment as inevitably there’s more speculation about what may or may not be in it. Asked if Sunak has become more confident that a statement will be agreed, they said: I’m not going to put a prediction on the communique. What’s important is what actions come out of this. Continued support for Ukraine from a wide variety of countries. Rumours have been circulating on Telegram channels that Ukrainian forces have retaken settlements on the eastern bank of Kherson region, after pushing Russian forces from the west bank on Friday. Kherson region is divided by the River Dnipro. These rumours about a new stage in the Ukrainian offensive come in addition to a statement on Saturday by Ukraine’s southern command that combat activities were ongoing to retake the Kinburn peninsula, which sits just south of Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the Black Sea. But news about an offensive on those fronts was absent from the morning update from Ukraine’s general staff. Ukraine’s authorities often delay confirming a successful battle or operation until a day or two after its completion. They have also urged people to refrain from divulging the details of active battles or Ukrainian military plans so as not to give Russia a tactical advantage. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, played to the rumours that the Kinburn peninsula had been freed by posting cryptic emojis on his Telegram. The message including a wave emoji followed by a beach emoji and then the equals sign followed by a flexed muscle. Yermak has become known for his emoji messages. Later on Monday, he posted the word “patience”. The southern command’s Monday evening report stated that Russia had tried to attack the Ukrainian mainland town of Ochakiv from the Kinburn peninsula and that the Ukrainian forces had destroyed a large Russian ammunition stockpile in Oleshky, the town on the left bank that was rumoured to have been retaken. The spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Ukrainian United News on Tuesday that the south continued to be an area of ongoing battles so “we are keeping quiet about it now”. However, speaking to Espresso TV, also on Tuesday, she said Russian forces had retreated from their defensive positions along the left side of the riverbank by 15-20km in order to avoid being shelled by the Ukrainians. “We do not stand still and (we) employ counter-battery fire, said Humeniuk, which includes multiple rocket laughers, artillery and mortars. “In connection with this … enemy troops on the left bank of the Dnipro (are) moving 15-20 km back from the shore.” The head of football’s world governing body, Fifa, issued a plea on Tuesday for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup, calling for all sides to use the tournament as a “positive trigger” to work towards a resolution. Gianni Infantino, speaking during a lunch with leaders of the G20 major economies on the Indonesian island of Bali, said the month-long World Cup, which starts in Qatar on Sunday, offered a unique platform for peace. Fifa’s president said: My plea to all of you, to think on a temporary ceasefire for one month for the duration of the World Cup, or at least the implementation of some humanitarian corridors or anything that could lead to the resumption of dialogue as a first step to peace. You’re the world leaders, you have the ability to influence the course of history. Football and the World Cup are offering you and the world a unique platform of unity and peace all over the world. Russia reached the quarter-finals of the last World Cup in 2018, which it hosted, but has been barred from this tournament over its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine came close to qualifying for Qatar but lost out to Wales in a deciding playoff in June. Infantino noted that Russia hosted the 2018 edition and Ukraine is bidding to hold the 2030 contest, and as many as 5.5 billion people are expected to watch this year’s event, which could give a message of hope. He said: Maybe the current World Cup, starting in five days, can be that positive trigger. Read the full story here: In his address to world leaders gathered for the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined a series of conditions needed to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking virtually from Ukraine, he said Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine, withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory and pay compensation for damage caused. Zelenskiy is calling for an international conference to “cement key element of the postwar security architecture” and prevent a recurrence of “Russian aggression”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that Zelenskiy’s statement that there will be no “Minsk-3” deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity. Matilda Bogner, head of the monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the “vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence. On the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported “credible allegations” of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses. There are encouraging signs at the G20 meeting in Bali for a consensus that Russia’s war against Ukraine is not acceptable and that nuclear weapons must not be used, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. “This is a consensus that is gaining ground here,” he told the media. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, António Guterres. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has urged a return to diplomacy to end the Russia-Ukraine war, reiterating the south Asian nation’s call for peace in the ongoing conflict. “I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine,” Modi said in his opening remarks at the G20 summit. Germany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was working to ascertain details about the death of Zambian student on the frontline in Ukraine. Zambia on Monday asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow had ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine. Zelenskiy has said Russian troops have “destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure” in Kherson. “There is no electricity, no communication, no internet, no television … Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people,” he said in his Monday evening address. Ukrainian national energy company Ukrenergo said Russia also destroyed key energy infrastructure in the region. “The energy facility that provided power supply to the entire right bank of the Kherson region and a significant part of the Mykolaiv region, is practically destroyed,” Ukrenergo chief Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will hand you over to Léonie Chao-Fong, and I will be back later on. Reuters is carrying some additional details on the allegation that both Ukrainian and Russian forces have mistreated prisoners of war during the conflict. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN’s OHCHR monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the “vast majority” of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence. She said the treatment was aimed at intimidating and humiliating them. One man in a penal colony near Olenivka told the team that members of Russian-affiliated armed groups “attached wires to my genitalia and nose and shocked me. They simply had fun and were not interested in my replies to their questions.” On the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported “credible allegations” of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses. Other Russian prisoners reported poor and humiliating conditions of transport and of being packed into trucks or vans naked, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UN team said it had also documented cases of so-called “welcome beatings” at a penal colony. There are encouraging signs at the G20 meeting in Bali for a consensus that Russia’s war against Ukraine is not acceptable and that nuclear weapons must not be used, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. “This is a consensus that is gaining ground here,” Reuters reports he told the media in Bali. Asked about a conversation with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Scholz said: “He stood near me and said a couple of sentences, that was the conversation.” Scholz also said he would continue to talk to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to find solutions to end the war against Ukraine. The UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity. Reuters reports the UN Ukraine-based monitoring team based its findings on interviews with more than 100 prisoners of war on each side of the conflict. The interviews with Ukrainian prisoners of war were conducted after their release, since Russia did not grant access to detention sites, it said. Russia, which invaded Ukraine on 24 February, denies torture or other forms of maltreatment of PoWs. Kyiv has previously said it checks all information regarding the treatment of PoWs and will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. The OHCHR has also issued updated civilian casualty figures for the war in a bulletin updated on Monday. It put the figure for civilian casualties at 6,557 killed and 10,074 injured. The bulletin adds: Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes. OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, Reuters reports. Russian grains and fertilisers are not directly targeted by western sanctions, but Moscow has complained for months that they are effectively restricted because the sanctions limit access to ports, finance and insurance. Oleksandr Syenkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, has reported on Telegram that there is an air raid alert in place in the city. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is giving a press briefing at the G20 summit in Bali. We will bring you fuller quotes in due course, but so far he has accused the west of trying to politicise the traditional joint message at the end of the summit by mentioning Ukraine. He also said that he had discussed Ukraine with German chancellor Olaf Scholz and French president Emmanuel Macron, that the hybrid war in Ukraine had been started by the west, and that Ukraine was prolonging the conflict. Here is the video clip of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling via video link at the G20 for a “just” end to Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy said Kyiv should not be pushed to compromise on its sovereignty or territorial integrity. “Ukraine’s control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored. This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities,” he said. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it was working to ascertain details about the death of Zambian student on the frontline in Ukraine, Reuters report, citing the Tass news agency. Zambia on Monday asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow had ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine. Germany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said. “We have reached agreement, and work can start immediately so that all the equipment which has been supplied [to Kyiv] can be repaired after coming out of battle,” Reuters reports she told the media as she arrived for a meeting with her EU counterparts in Brussels. Berlin is planning to train 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers in Germany as part of an EU training mission by June, she added. The Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour reports from Bali: If Sergei Lavrov, the 72-year-old whiskey-drinking Russian foreign minister, had indeed suffered a heart flutter soon after stepping off the plane in Bali it would have been understandable for a man who has been cast by his leader as his stand-in punchbag at the summit. Viewing the forces arrayed against him at the G20, President Vladimir Putin deputed Lavrov to attend the two-day event in his stead, and for a brief moment it appeared to have been too much. News agencies reported Lavrov had been sent to hospital for a check-up, only for the Russian foreign ministry to rush out a picture of Lavrov in shorts and sporting an Apple watch and Jean-Michel Basquiat-inspired T-shirt thumbing his notes for his first address at the summit on Tuesday. The Russian foreign ministry had a field day denouncing what it called western propaganda as a high-level lie. Oddly, if Lavrov has succumbed to genuine ill-health, it would have been a moment of genuine regret for some western diplomats, who over two decades have become inured to this fixture of Russian diplomacy. “He is a rogue,” said one western diplomat, “but we all know his outbursts are stage-managed, and calculated. It’s all smiles afterwards. He is a professional.” With a glamorous step-daughter Polina, his career in service of the Russian state has been well spent and rewarded. Read more of Patrick Wintour’s profile here: Sergei Lavrov, a fixture of Russian diplomacy facing his toughest test in Ukraine Bilateral meetings continue as part of the G20 summit in Bali. Reuters reports that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted a photo of the pair seated at a table in Bali with Russian and UN flags, but the ministry provided no details of what the pair discussed. In a separate development, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, has met his US counterpart, Joe Biden. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has urged a return to diplomacy to end the Russia-Ukraine war, reiterating the south Asian nation’s call for peace in the ongoing conflict. Reuters reports India has not condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but Modi told the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in September that “today’s era is not an era of war”. “I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine,” Modi said in his opening remarks at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. “The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world.” Reuters is reporting a French read-out from the meeting between France’s president Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping which states that they reaffirmed their firm position on preventing the use of nuclear arms in the war in Ukraine. Yesterday the White House issued a similar read-out mentioning nuclear weapons after Joe Biden met the Chinese president, however the communiqué from the Chinese side did not mention them. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, reports an improved situation in his western region of Ukraine, saying that there were no air alerts overnight, and that there are no power outages scheduled for today. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s statement that there will be no “Minsk-3” deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow, Reuters reports, citing the RIA Novosti news agency. [See 6.30 GMT] Russia commenced its latest invasion of Ukraine in February this year, and in September claimed to have annexed four regions of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. Tobias Ellwood, who is a Conservative MP and chair of the defence select committee in the UK’s parliament, has been interviewed by Sky News during his visit to Odesa. He told viewers in the UK it was a worry that the west’s commitment to Ukraine might drain away. He said: We don’t have good form on this. If you look at all the places that we’ve been to, to try and provide a force for good, from Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and so forth, we’ve actually given up and gone home leaving problems there. We must not do the same here. He said it was important “we don’t give up now, that we don’t sign a deal, that we don’t step back, but we’re able to flush Russia completely out of Ukraine”. He was critical of Russia’s message at the G20, saying: Lavrov is just going to give us the lines that Putin has been spouting, to say that this is nobody else’s business. It is our business, because the grain ships behind me are not moving as they should do. Security in eastern Europe is everybody’s security. If we don’t flush Russia out of Ukraine now, how can the Ukrainian economy move forward? How can the sovereign identity of Ukraine exist? Ellwood also said that while the victory in Kherson was welcome, the west needed to continue to prepare for what came next. He said: Kherson is massively humiliating for Putin. They’ve had to withdraw across the Dnipro River. But Russia still has control of land the size of Portugal in Ukraine. So this is far from over. Jens Stoltenberg is absolutely right to encourage Nato members to continue providing individual bilateral support – as Britain is doing – because munitions and so forth, weapon systems, they need to keep going. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, has published a photo purportedly from the recently liberated city of Kherson to illustrate the lack of power in the region. “Kherson. Six days without electricity. People charge their phones on the main square from a generator brought by a volunteer,” he tweeted. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, held a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali on Tuesday, according to Russia’s foreign ministry. The meeting between the pair comes amid increasing tensions between Ukraine, its western allies and what some view as a growing allegiance between Russia and China. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Moscow’s strength should not be underestimated despite Kyiv’s recent battlefield successes. During a joint news conference with Dutch government officials in The Hague on Monday, Stoltenberg told reporters: We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia. The Russian armed forces retain significant capabilities, as well as a large number of troops. The coming months will be difficult. Putin’s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course.” President Joko Widodo has called for unity at the opening of the G20 summit, and said that the gathered leaders must not allow the world to fall into another cold war. His remarks will probably be interpreted as a commentary on the effects that Russia’s war in Ukraine is having on the wider global economy. Without referring directly to the war in Ukraine, Widodo said that if the war did not end, it would be difficult for the world to move forward. “Indonesia has tried as best as possible to bridge very wide differences. We have no other option, collaboration is badly needed,” he said. Ukraine’s president followed up on the comments he made to G20 leaders with a statement posted on his Telegram channel on Tuesday. It is not worth offering Ukraine compromises with conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence. … if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions. We will not allow Russia to wait, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilisation. There will be no Minsk-3, which Russia will violate immediately after the agreement. There is a Ukrainian formula for peace. Peace for Ukraine, Europe and the world. And there is a set of solutions that can be implemented to really guarantee peace. Having participated in the G20 summit, I presented proposals for such solutions – specific and honest. Ukraine offers the leading states of the world to be co-creators of peace together with us.” Zelenskiy then outlined 10 proposals of Ukraine: 1. Radiation and nuclear safety. 2. Food safety. 3. Energy security. 4. Release of all prisoners and deportees. 5. Implementation of the UN charter and restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the world order. 6. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities. 7. Restoring justice. 8. Anti-ecocide. 9. Prevention of escalation. 10. Fixing the end of the war. The G20 will reportedly issue a statement at the end of the G20 summit, where “most” members will condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine. According to a draft communique seen by Agence France-Presse, the group of 20 will deplore the economic impact of the Ukraine conflict and call for the extension of a deal with Russia expiring on Saturday that allows the export of Ukrainian grain. I think you’re going to see most members of the G20 make clear that they condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine, that they see Russia’s war in Ukraine as the root source of immense economic and humanitarian suffering in the world,” a US official told reporters while speaking on condition of anonymity. The statement, to be issued at the end of the summit this week in Bali, will show that the G20 is “really isolating Russia” - a member of the group of the world’s biggest economies. The official would not say how many countries would not join the condemnation, nor how diplomats would craft the non-unanimous declaration within the document, which is issued by all member countries. The US official said, “Russia’s war of aggression … is being condemned in the strongest possible terms.” The statement, said the official, “speaks in very clear terms”. In his address to world leaders gathered for the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined a series of conditions needed to end the war Ukraine. Speaking virtually from Ukraine, he said that Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine, withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory and pay compensation for damage caused. Zelenskiy is calling for an international conference to “cement key element of the postwar security architecture” and prevent a recurrence of “Russian aggression”. “When all anti-war measures are implemented, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties.” Throughout his speech he pointedly thanked the “G19” – excluding Russia – for making it clear that there were “no excuses for nuclear blackmail.” Russian president Vladimir Putin was not in the room, but his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was in attendance at the meeting in Bali. The United Nations General Assembly has called for Russia to make reparations to Ukraine and be held accountable for its conduct. The assembly voted to approve a resolution on Monday, supported by 94 of the assembly’s 193 members, saying Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts.” The resolution also recommends that member states, in cooperation with Ukraine, create an international register to record evidence and claims against Russia. Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya used the biblical adage that “there is nothing new under the sun” as a motif throughout his remarks in presenting the resolution on Monday. “Seventy-seven years ago, the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations, calling it a moral right of a country that has suffered war and occupation,” he said. “Today, Russia, who claims to be the successor of the 20th century’s tyranny, is doing everything it can to avoid paying the price for its own war and occupation, trying to escape accountability for the crimes it is committing.” Zelenskiy hailed the vote as a “diplomatic victory” in a tweet late on Monday night. From the liberation victory in Kherson to the diplomatic victory in New York - the General Assembly has just given the green light to the creation of a compensation mechanism for Russian crimes in Ukraine. The aggressor will pay for what he did!” Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a surprise visit to Kherson on Monday, saying the recapture of the southern city marked “the beginning of the end of the war”. “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country,” he said. Zelenskiy said it was important to visit Kherson to show residents his support and to demonstrate that “we are really returning, we really raise our flag”. He said: “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. The United Nations General Assembly has called for Russia to make reparations to Ukraine and be held accountable for its conduct in a resolution supported by 94 of the assembly’s 193 members. Volodymyr Zelenskiy also made a surprise visit to Kherson, saying the recapture of the southern city marked “the beginning of the end of the war”. “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country,” he said. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to de-mine the strategic southern city of Kherson and restore power across the region after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russian troops have “destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure” in Kherson. “There is no electricity, no communication, no internet, no television … Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people,” he said in his Monday evening address. Ukrainian national energy company Ukrenergo said Russia also destroyed key energy infrastructure in the region. “The energy facility that provided power supply to the entire right bank of the Kherson region and a significant part of the Mykolaiv region, is practically destroyed,” Ukrenergo chief Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said. Zelenskiy made a surprise visit to Kherson on Monday, saying the recapture of the southern city marked “the beginning of the end of the war”. “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country,” he said. Zelenskiy said it was important to visit Kherson to show residents his support and to demonstrate that “we are really returning, we really raise our flag”. He said: “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged.” The US believes that Russian troops carried out a relatively orderly withdrawal from the city of Kherson, a senior US military official said on Monday, in contrast to some of the more chaotic retreats in the country. “We assess that it was a relatively orderly withdrawal,” the official spoke on the condition of anonymity, according to a Reuters report. According to Russian media, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. The United Nations General Assembly has called for Russia to make reparations to Ukraine and be held accountable for its conduct. The assembly voted to approve a resolution on Monday, supported by 94 of the assembly’s 193 members, saying Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts.” The resolution also recommends that member states, in cooperation with Ukraine, create an international register to record evidence and claims against Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought”, the White House said. Beijing’s readout from the long-awaited meeting in Bali differed slightly and did not mention the pair agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. However, on Sunday, Chinese premier Li Keqiang emphasised the “irresponsibility” of nuclear threats, suggesting China was uncomfortable with Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, a senior US official said. Zelenskiy welcomed statements from the US and China. “This is a grouping of very weighty states. And today, on the eve of the summit, weighty statements have already been made,” he said in his Monday night video address. “In particular, it is important that the United States and China jointly highlighted that the threats of using nuclear weapons were unacceptable. Everyone understands to whom these words are addressed.” CIA director, Bill Burns, met his Russian counterpart in Turkey on Monday to talk about “the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia” in a rare high-level meeting, US officials said. The meeting in Ankara with the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, followed speculation that some senior US figures would like Ukraine to enter negotiations with the Kremlin to end the war. Officials insisted the US is not engaged in secret peace talks with Moscow without Ukrainian officials being present. Rishi Sunak has called Russia a “pariah state” on the eve of his first meeting of the G20 in Indonesia, where he has vowed to confront Moscow’s representative in public and on the sidelines of the summit. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity during the summit to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, attending in Vladimir Putin’s absence. “Russia is becoming a pariah state and he’s [Putin] not there to take responsibility for what he’s doing,” Sunak told reporters. The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least €8bn (£7bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. A former Russian prison inmate, who defected to Ukraine after being recruited by the Kremlin-linked private military group Wagner, was reportedly executed and repeatedly struck with a sledgehammer. Footage of the summary killing of Yevgeny Nuzhin was posted over the weekend by the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/aug/01/german-utilities-firm-rwe-to-close-its-last-uk-coal-plant-in-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-01T17:37:07Z","webTitle":"German utilities firm RWE to close its last UK coal plant in 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/german-utilities-firm-rwe-to-close-its-last-uk-coal-plant-in-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/aug/01/german-utilities-firm-rwe-to-close-its-last-uk-coal-plant-in-2020","fields":{"headline":"German utilities firm RWE to close its last UK coal plant in 2020","bodyText":"The German utility giant RWE will close its last UK coal plant after the coming winter, leaving only four remaining coal plants powering British homes. RWE will close the Aberthaw B power station in south Wales at the end of March 2020 after half a century generating electricity from coal. The energy company, which runs one of the largest portfolios of gas power plants, said it had been clear for some time that the UK was a challenging market for coal generators. The UK used coal for less than 5% of its electricity last year, and went without coal-generated power altogether for over a week earlier this year, which was the longest coal-free period since the Industrial Revolution. Coal has been driven out of the electricity system due to rising taxes on carbon emissions, and will be banned by the government from 2025 to help the UK meet its climate targets. The shutdown of Aberthaw B comes after SSE said in June it would close the Fiddler’s Ferry coal plant near Warrington in Cheshire by the end of March 2020 because it cannot compete with the economics of gas and renewable energy. EDF Energy said in February that it would shutter the Cottam coal plant in September. The string of shutdowns means that by next spring just four coal plants will remain in the UK: the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar plants in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in North Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas. Roger Miesen, the chief executive of RWE’s generation business, said: “This is a difficult time for everyone at Aberthaw power station. However, market conditions made this decision necessary.” He added the company would complete a consultation process with the 170 people directly employed by the plant in the coming months. The Unite trade union called for an urgent meeting with the company to explain why the plant will close earlier than the expected 2021 shutdown. “The reasons given for the closure are economic – the plant has rarely run over the last few months,” said Kelvin Mawer, a regional officer at Unite. “However, the decision to close has come a lot earlier than expected.” Tom Glover, RWE’s UK country chair, said: “For nearly 50 years the plant has played an invaluable role in helping to secure the energy supplies across the UK electricity system and we are very proud of its flexibility and resilience.” The decline of coal in the UK’s energy mix has left space for the growth of renewable energy sources, which generated a third of all electricity used last year. The government’s official annual energy report revealed that low-carbon electricity – which includes nuclear power and renewables – was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year. Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, said the shutdown of Aberthaw should encourage more government support for renewables to help meet the UK’s energy needs. Greenpeace has often criticised the government for blocking onshore windfarms from competing for government subsidies against other energy technologies after the Conservative manifesto ruled out more windfarms for England. Parr said ministers should “take the brakes off wind and solar power, which will be doing all the heavy lifting in the job of getting the UK to a clean power system”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2019/oct/01/volunteering-kent-organic-farm-wwoof-sustainability","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-01T05:30:33Z","webTitle":"A weekend break on an organic farm in Kent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/oct/01/volunteering-kent-organic-farm-wwoof-sustainability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2019/oct/01/volunteering-kent-organic-farm-wwoof-sustainability","fields":{"headline":"A weekend break on an organic farm in Kent","bodyText":"As dusk fell, firelight spilled from the windows of the farmhouse and the hens trooped single file up a sloping branch to roost in the leafy canopy overhead. They woke me at dawn the next day, landing like ripe pears on the roof of the rickety caravan where I slept under two duvets and in a sleeping bag, hat and gloves. As an unpaid volunteer agricultural worker escaping from my London bubble, it was time to pull on my wellies and yomp across a muddy paddock to feed pigs. That was 6am on a freezing morning 18 months ago, and right from the start I was hooked. Burscombe Cliff Farm lies down a steep muddy lane on the side of a wooded escarpment in the Weald of Kent, at medieval Egerton village, near Ashford, just an hour down the M20 from my home. It has been welcoming “Wwoofers” for nearly 30 years, since the original Working Weekends on Organic Farms movement (now called World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, but still Wwoof) was founded in 1971. People of all ages and nationalities have fed the livestock, dug the veg patch, walked the young bulls and bunked down in the farm’s ancient caravans. Unlike me, most arrive by train or bike. But I got to go home piled high with fresh local produce and bags of compost. Our host is seventysomething former doctor Hilary Jones, who breeds award-winning Blonde d’Aquitaine cattle, gentle creatures the size of small elephants. She has been committed to sustainability since before ecotourism was a thing. A faded sticker – Nuclear Power No Thanks – reveals the remains of an old van once used to get to an Aldermaston march in a heap of brambles beyond her back door. For relaxation, Jones dyes and spins the wool from her sheep – in weld yellow, rose madder pink and indigo blue, and the bright orange she presses from onion skins. Nothing is wasted here. Everything is mended or repurposed. There is wifi, but no TV, just BBC Radio 3 and intelligent engaged chat to the click of knitting needles or the soothing clunk of the spinning wheel. The UK has more than 550 Wwoof hosts, dedicated organic farmers and smallholders promoting awareness of ecological management of our landscapes and wildlife by offering visitors bed, board and hands-on experience in exchange for six hours’ labour a day. There are also around 4,000 registered UK Wwoofers. In the 18 months I have been coming here, I have delivered lambs (“We are a grandmother”), groomed the prize bull, scythed a field, mended the greenhouse and learned to eat pigs whose ears I have scratched. It hasn’t turned me vegetarian, but I treat meat with more respect and buy less of it. Wwoofing this way, with regular return visits, is like walking into The Archers. I get updates on the fight to save the local shop and the library van, and chat to everyone from the artist neighbours in the cottage across the fields to the shepherd managing a large conventional flock on the next farm, the tractor man trying to set up his own decorating business, the veg box grower and passing hikers out enjoying the countryside. There are at least three regular Wwoofers at Burscombe Cliff: a teacher, a writer and a journalist. We could visit other farms and Wwoof in other countries – there are 132 member countries to choose from, and Australia, New Zealand and the US each has several thousand hosts – but we like it here, taking mini-breaks from our city lives, filling our lungs with fresh air and swinging our shoulders. Last week I popped back for a happy afternoon up a ladder in the orchard, picking apples. In the next weeks the cows will start coming in from the fields for calving, and the ram will go out to the ewes on 5 November for lambing in early April. In between, there are fences to mend, medlars to pick, broad beans and onion sets to plant, and above all logs to chop for the hungry Rayburn stove. There’s always plenty to do and winter is coming. • Find out more at wwoof.net.

It’s an awkward anecdote for the Liberal candidate hoping to achieve what would be a once-in-a-century win for a government candidate in a byelection, when the electorate goes to the polls on 4 July. A key part of the Labor pitch is that Eden-Monaro – which covers Canberra commuter towns Yass and Queanbeyan and stretches down to Eden near the Victorian border and up to Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands – has been forgotten by the Coalition. And it’s not the first time Kotvojs has called for help. This correspondent recalls an exchange on the sidelines of the third leaders’ debate between Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten that gave insight into the 2019 campaign. As the leaders made their pitch to voters, Kotvojs told Mathias Cormann – one of the most senior members of the government in the crowd – how well she was performing, in the hope her party would throw more at the seat. Eden-Monaro is the quintessential bellwether seat, but since Mike Kelly had a 3% buffer and a strong personal vote, all the attention was on the battle for neighbouring Gilmore. “Good, good Fiona – you have them shaking in their boots,” Cormann replied. Kotvojs – preselected again as the Liberal candidate before the byelection triggered by Kelly’s resignation – rejects this correspondent’s recollection. “I think you’ve probably got the wrong person … That wasn’t me,” she says, bristling at the suggestion Eden-Monaro was overlooked. The sense the seat was winnable was vindicated – on election night, Kotvojs pulled off a 2% swing and came within 1,685 votes of knocking off Kelly. When NSW transport minister Andrew Constance briefly entered but then withdrew from the race to replace Kelly, Kotvojs clinched Liberal preselection on 24 May, six weeks out from polling day on 4 July. Labor’s star recruit the Bega Valley Shire mayor, Kristy McBain, has had the inside running throughout most of May. The Nationals have selected Queanbeyan deputy mayor Trevor Hicks as their candidate; the Greens and Shooters, Farmers and Fishers have also put their hand up to contest. “At this stage I’m not concentrating on any of the opponents in Eden-Monaro,” McBain says. “I’ve been the Labor candidate for over a month now – I’ve been out speaking to people and businesses about their concerns. “When the other major parties eventually got around – or are still getting around to getting a candidate – we’ve actually been talking to people to understand the things they need most.” McBain has a positive streak and her campaign pitch is to people who are “sick of politics” and don’t want their MP to “get dragged down in negativity”. She seeks to embody the leader Anthony Albanese’s belief that voters are suffering “conflict fatigue”, so McBain stresses her ability to cooperate and work with anyone – including a Coalition government. But McBain is seeking to represent an electorate that she says has “fallen through the cracks” – especially after it was “substantially impacted” by the Black Summer bushfires. Kotvojs says the government has not forgotten Eden-Monaro, citing funding to remove mobile phone blackspots and the level of support after the bushfires. Kotvojs suggests that Covid-19 may have slowed government processes, but concedes “many people are concerned” about the speed with which the $2bn set aside for bushfire relief is being spent. “Many people tell me how fantastic it is, where they have found it straightforward – I hear both messages.” The electorate includes the town of Cobargo, made famous for its hostile reception to Scott Morrison when the prime minister visited some of the communities hit hardest by bushfire after an ill-advised holiday to Hawaii. There is a lot of territory to cover in Eden-Monaro, a difficulty that was influential in triggering Kelly’s retirement for health reasons. The campaign is the first since Morrison tanked in popularity after the Black Summer fires only to bounce back just as sharply due to the Australian governments’ handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. McBain says streamlining the bushfire recovery process and helping businesses shut down due to coronavirus “is definitely going to be a huge part of this campaign”. And despite her positive streak she doesn’t let the government off the hook for the handling of the fires. “The warnings signs were all there, months before the bushfire season started,” she says. “We had the former emergency services commissioner wanting to meet with the government about the impact they saw coming, [NSW Rural Fire Service] put out a prediction map in August 2019 – which was basically, almost spot on, [about] the amount of area under threat, and could potentially burn during the summer season. “There should’ve been better preparation and planing on behalf of the federal government … There was no preparation. “We we’re asking for help and assistance for small business for weeks and months before it was implemented … and we were told it wasn’t in the domain of federal government – and that’s really disappointing for communities that are struggling.” Kotvojs has a weakness among voters who join the dots between bushfires and longer, hotter summers: a long history of downplaying the human contribution to climate change. Kotvojs, a development expert and small business owner, wants everybody to know that her farm is solar-powered and off-grid, and that she believes humans are contributing to climate change. “I’ve always held that belief,” Kotvojs says, arguing that her “whole career” is consistent with that claim. But does she stand by her previous statements that “solar activity” is the primary driver of climate change, that it’s a “myth” it increases cyclones and the risk to Pacific nations is overstated? “Yes … I cannot deny the facts,” she says, citing a University of Auckland study on Tuvalu’s growing land mass. “My background is in the environment – in the early 1990s I set up sea level monitoring stations across the Pacific. “I’ve written environmental impact statements and been part of teams that won Australia-wide environmental awards – my approach is always evidence-based.” Standing alongside Morrison in Murrumbateman on 24 May, Kotvojs dodged a question about whether she supports a zero-emissions target by 2050. “Humans contribute to that changing climate and I believe that we need to have a reduction in emissions, that we need to look at approaches to be adaptive and to have our communities resilient,” she said instead. McBain is unconvinced. “My view has been clear, it hasn’t changed from one year to the next dependent on a byelection and people should be aware perhaps my opponent’s views have changed or she’s [just] saying they’re changed.” Other than the usual Coalition lines about reducing emissions through “technology, not taxes” – environmental policy has so far come up in Kotvojs’s online campaigning more in the context of economic development than climate change. Kotvojs has told her Facebook followers that “red tape” and “green tape” are some of the things holding farmers and small businesses back. Kotvojs tells Guardian Australia the native grassland laws “contradict in various areas” and that inconsistencies have “a perverse effect in relation to the native grasslands and the environment”. Kotvojs wants to be a “strong voice in government to drive those discussions” including to call for “faster development applications” and also believes it is “incredibly complex” for employers to hire. “Working out what award [potential employees] are under and what they should be paying … It needs to be easier to do all those things.” Asked if she supports new coal or nuclear power stations, Kotvojs says she is “not wedded to any particular form of power production”. “I believe in a market-driven approach – the only way to get prices down for people is to ensure that there are not subsidies, because people who can least afford it are having to pay.” With Australia in the greatest economic contraction since the Great Depression and most supports due to expire by September – the role of government is front of mind in the campaign. McBain argues that some industries have been left out of government assistance, and many missed out on the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy, jobkeeper. In a Facebook Q&amp;A, McBain says the jobseeker unemployment benefit cannot “snap back” to its old rate of $40 a day, which she labels “clearly inadequate”. “I would challenge anybody to live off that. It is too low, it does prevent people getting back into the workforce and getting a job.” But two years out from a general election, McBain puts the onus back on the government to provide “some certainty” and explain what will happen to the payments after September. Kotvojs praises the jobkeeper program, noting it has helped employees stay in work, but toes the party line that both the wage subsidy and the coronavirus supplement on unemployment benefits were temporary. As restrictions ease, businesses aim to get “back to being resilient and independent”, she says. The coronavirus’ most visible impact is not on policy but the means of campaigning. Both candidates have the difficulty of traversing the varied terrain from the Snowy Mountains down to the coast, without the usual fixtures of an election campaign along the way. McBain is best known on the south coast but points to 10 years in Canberra, work in Queanbeyan and Yass as a lawyer, and on the Canberra Region Joint Organisation which covers all the councils in the electorate as evidence of broader exposure. Kissing babies and supermarket walk-throughs have been replaced by Zoom meetings and phone banking, she says. “There’s not going to be huge town hall debates because of social distancing, it’s going to be very different campaign.” Kotvojs said she campaigned at shows, rodeos and shopping centres through the 2019 campaign and “this year that’s not going to be possible” due to Covid-19. McBain’s pitch is that she is the “best possible local representative” and that – like Mike Kelly – she can “get a lot done from opposition”. Kotvojs default solution to most problems is to call for better coordination between different levels of government, and simpler presentation of grants and recovery programs already on offer. It helps her sympathise with those who haven’t been given what they need without criticising the NSW or federal Coalition governments. It holds out the possibility that help was there if only they knew where to look. Kotvojs knew how to apply, and she’s still waiting on that fence. “I got an email last night in regards to the fencing grant – I need to give someone from the department a call about that. So hopefully that one will be progressing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/04/why-are-unions-so-keen-on-nuclear-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T17:43:07Z","webTitle":"Why are unions so keen on nuclear jobs? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/04/why-are-unions-so-keen-on-nuclear-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/04/why-are-unions-so-keen-on-nuclear-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Why are unions so keen on nuclear jobs?","bodyText":"Thanks to Mike Clancy (Letters, 2 April) for responding to our analysis that intense UK government attachments to civil nuclear power are (to a significant – but dangerously undiscussed – extent) aimed at supporting the national industrial base underpinning nuclear submarine capabilities.

A host of ways to manage intermittency are routinely priced at a small fraction of the growing cost advantage of renewable energy.

This liveblog will be closing but you can continue reading the latest developments on our latest liveblog below. Before we launch our new liveblog, here is a comprehensive rundown of where the situation currently stands: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the situation in the town of Borodyanka was “much worse” than in nearby Bucha, where Russian forces’ suspected killings of civilians received global condemnation. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, added: “Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. Zelenskiy highlighted the bravery of his nation in his latest late-night national address. “Being brave is our brand,” he said, while calling for bolder sanctions on Russia. He also claimed Russian troops were preparing “elaborate propaganda scenarios” to make it look like civilians they had killed in Mariupol were killed by Ukrainian soldiers. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Boris Johnson is set to meet the German Chancellor as they look to discuss how to help European countries wean themselves off Russian gas following the attack on Ukraine. Johnson will host Olaf Scholz at Downing Street on Friday, with a press conference planned for the afternoon, PA Media reports. Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. The European Union approved an embargo on Russian coal imports and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war. The measure will take effect from mid-August. In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, urged women, children and elderly people to leave. Similar calls were made by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had confirmed more than 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol. The United Nations general assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin contradicted these claims, saying he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were beaten back by the Ukrainian military. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the war would be a “long slog” at the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington DC. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and were providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. The prospect of Finland and Sweden joining Nato was part of the discussion between foreign ministers from the military alliance in Brussels this week, a senior US State Department official said. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, ministers spoke of “haunting” photographs of mutilated bodies, alleged executions and reports of sexual assaults by Russian troops. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. Russia has imposed sanctions on Australian and New Zealand citizens, including their prime ministers, the Russian foreign ministry announced. Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was wounded in Ukraine during an attack that killed two of his colleagues, said on Thursday that he had sustained serious injuries but felt “pretty damn lucky” to have survived. Russia has imposed sanctions on Australian and New Zealand citizens, including their prime ministers, the Russian foreign ministry announced. Entry bans have been imposed on 228 Australian government members and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, in response to sanctions from Canberra. The ministry published a list of 228 Australian lawmakers and government members who were barred from entering Russia on Thursday. It said Australia “obediently follows the decisions of the West” and has decided to sanction Russia’s top managers and almost all of its deputies. “In the near future, members of the Australian army, businesspeople, experts and members of the media who have contributed to the formation of negative attitudes towards Russia will also be included in the blacklist and announced.” And a total of 130 New Zealand citizens, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Governor-General Cynthia Kiro and members of the government and parliament were also banned from Russia because of their unfriendly actions against Russia as a matter of reciprocity. The ministry said the sanctions took effect Thursday. Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall, who was injured in an attack outside Kyiv, has posted on Twitter about his injuries and paid tribute to his colleagues Sasha and Pierre who were killed. The United States has blacklisted two Russian state-owned enterprises, United Shipbuilding Corp and the Alrosa diamond mining company, denying them access to the US financial system over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said on Thursday. “Through these designations, Treasury is cutting off additional sources of support and revenue for the Government of the Russian Federation to wage its unprovoked war against Ukraine,” the US officials said in a press release. Australia has sent its first convoy of 20 refitted Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine on aircraft C-17 Globemasters leaving Brisbane on Friday. It is part of a $50m support package worth of military vehicles to the country. The armoured vehicles have been repainted olive green with Ukraine’s flag stencilled on each side and the words ‘United with Ukraine’ emblazoned in both English and Ukrainian in a pledge of solidarity. “Australia may be thousands of kilometres away but we’re standing side by side with Ukraine against this illegal invasion with arms, equipment, aid and even energy sources,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. “Our Australian-designed and made Bushmasters are known around the world for their usefulness in a combat zone and they will help boost Ukraine’s defence against Russia’s unprovoked and illegal violence.” Boris Johnson is set to meet the German Chancellor as they look to discuss how to help European countries wean themselves off Russian gas following the attack on Ukraine. The prime minister will host Olaf Scholz at Downing Street on Friday, with a press conference planned for the afternoon, PA Media reports. Johnson is expected to offer assistance to Berlin, which is still heavily reliant on Russian gas, to reduce its dependence on Moscow’s energy exports in a bid to starve Vladimir Putin’s war machine of funds. It comes after UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, following a meeting of Nato counterparts in Brussels on Thursday, said she hoped to see “more countries” commit to banning Russian energy imports. The UK has pledged to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of 2022, with gas to follow as soon as possible. Germany has faced criticism from Ukraine and other European nations, including Poland, with claims it has been too slow to phase out Russian energy. Robert Habeck, the German economy and energy minister, has announced plans to stop importing oil and coal from Russia this year, and gas by mid-2024. Kyiv earlier called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies, warning that the battle for Donbas will remind Nato members of the second world war. “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a meeting of his counterparts in the alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Watch Kuleba’s address in the video below. Microsoft Corp said it disrupted hacking attempts by Russian military spies aimed at breaking into Ukrainian, European Union, and American targets. In a blog post, the tech firm said a group it nicknamed ‘Strontium’ was using seven internet domains as part of an effort to spy on government bodies and think tanks in the EU and the United States, as well as Ukrainian institutions such as media organisations. Microsoft did not identify any of the targets by name. Strontium is Microsoft’s moniker for a group others often call Fancy Bear or APT28 - a hacking squad linked to Russia’s military intelligence agency. The United States has sharply increased the number of Ukrainians admitted to the country at the Mexican border as more refugees fleeing the Russian invasion follow the same route. The number of Ukrainians arriving at the US-Mexico border to seek asylum in the United States since Russia’s invasion of its neighbour has more than doubled in less than a week, officials said. A government recreation centre in the Mexican border city of Tijuana grew to about 1,000 refugees on Thursday, according to city officials. A canopy under which children played soccer only two days earlier was packed with people in rows of chairs and lined with bunk beds, the Associated Press reports. Tijuana has suddenly become a final stop for Ukrainians seeking refuge in the United States, where they are drawn by friends and families ready to host them and are convinced that the US will be a more suitable haven than Europe. US President Joe Biden said late last month his country would receive up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. British rock band Pink Floyd has released a new song to raise money for humanitarian relief in Ukraine, featuring the vocals of a Ukrainian singer who quit an international tour to fight for his country and was wounded. The single ‘Hey Hey, Rise Up’ - Pink Floyd’s first original new music in almost 30 years - was recorded last week and highlights singing by Andriy Khlyvnyuk from Ukrainian band Boombox. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour said he learned that Khlyvnyuk - with whom he had previously performed - left a US tour with Boombox and returned to Ukraine to join the Territorial Defence Forces. “Then I saw this incredible video on Instagram, where he stands in a square in Kyiv with this beautiful gold-domed church and sings in the silence of a city with no traffic or background noise because of the war,” Gilmour said on Pink Floyd’s website. “It was a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music.” Gilmour said he spoke with Khlyvnyuk while he was in a hospital in Kyiv recovering from a mortar shrapnel injury. “I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing. We both hope to do something together in person in the future,” he said. Gilmour said he had a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren and he was feeling “the fury and the frustration” of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The European Union has approved an embargo on Russian coal imports and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war. The measure will take effect from mid-August, a month later than originally planned, following pressure from Germany to delay, reports Reuters news agency. That package also includes a 10 billion euro ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods, and the freezing of several Russian banks’ assets. The French presidency of the European Council said the sanction was estimated to be worth 4bn euros ($4.4bn) per year. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that, if not natural gas, oil would follow soon. The new coal sanction had to be agreed by all 27 member states and there had been concerns from some members about the impact. The EU nations import 45% of their coal from Russia, worth 4 billion euros a year. In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros. It is the first time the Europeans have targeted the Russian energy sector, on which they are heavily dependent. In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros. “Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5 billion euros the EU support already provided for military equipment for Ukraine,” European Council chief Charles Michel tweeted, also thanking EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell for proposing the extra funding. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that the situation in the town of Borodyanka was “much worse” than in nearby Bucha, where Russian forces’ suspected killings of civilians received global condemnation. Officials believe more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha, 35km northwest of the capital Kyiv, and around 50 of them were executed. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha were staged by the Ukrainian government to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace negotiations. “The work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It’s much worse there,” Zelenskiy said in a late-night national address. The town is about 25 km from Bucha. Zelenskiy did not provide any further detail or evidence that Russia was responsible for civilian deaths in the town. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Speaking in a televised briefing, Venediktova said: Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims.” On Tuesday, Venediktova said the number of victims in Borodyanka would be higher than anywhere else, but did not provide further details. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had confirmed more than 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol. “As of now, WHO has verified 103 incidents of attacks on health care, with 73 people killed and 51 injured, including health workers and patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference, calling it a “grim milestone. Of the confirmed attacks 89 had impacted health facilities and most of the rest hit transport services, including ambulances. “We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing,” the WHO chief said, adding they constituted “a violation of international humanitarian law.” Speaking at an earlier press conference in Lviv, WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge lamented that while health assistance had reached many “affected areas”, some were still out of reach. “It’s true some remain very difficult. I think a priority definitely, I think we all agree, would be Mariupol,” Kluge told reporters. Kluge noted that the WHO had “delivered over 185 tonnes of medical supplies to the hardest hit areas of the country, reaching half-a-million people”. The regional director also noted that “50% of Ukraine’s pharmacies are presumed closed and 1,000 health facilities are in proximity to conflict areas or changed areas of control”. Kluge also stressed that attacks on healthcare service were a clear “breach of international humanitarian law,” but also added that it was not the WHO’s mandate to attribute the attacks to actors and that they had only verified that the attacks had taken place. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were beaten back by the Ukrainian military. Austin told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Congress on Thursday: Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city. He was wrong. I think Putin has given up on his efforts to capture the capital city and is now focused on the south and east of the country.” On Wednesday, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Putin “has achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state.” Lithuania’s ambassador to Ukraine has returned to Kyiv after Russian forces withdrew from the Ukrainian capital, becoming one of the few diplomats to return to the city. Speaking with Agence France-Presse, ambassador Valdemaras Sarapinas said: I have just walked through the embassy door. Political and moral support is very important for the Ukrainians.” Like many others, the diplomat left Kyiv as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and had worked since from the western city of Lviv. Sarapinas’s return comes a day after Turkey announced it had moved its embassy in Ukraine back to Kyiv after having temporarily relocated it to Chernivtsi near the Romanian border. Poland and the Holy See were among the few who had maintained their representation in the city. Sarapinas said the city was “certainly” different following the Russian troop withdrawal from areas around the capital. “Two weeks ago, it was a dead city... Now there is life,” he said. The prospect of Finland and Sweden joining Nato was part of the discussion between foreign ministers from the military alliance in Brussels this week, a senior US State Department official said on Thursday. “Obviously this is going to be those countries’ choices to make,” said the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity. “The alliance’s open door remains open and there was discussion about that potential candidacy,” the official said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted the two Nordic countries to consider joining the US-led alliance. Since the invasion began public opinion polls commissioned by Finnish media outlets have shown a swift U-turn with the majority of Finns now favouring joining Nato. Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters earlier that Finland will clarify next steps in the coming weeks regarding a possible decision to seek Nato membership. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that if Finland and Sweden joined Nato then Russia would have to “rebalance the situation” with its own measures. The UN general assembly earlier voted to suspend Russia from its leading human rights body over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, which the US and Ukraine say are tantamount to war crimes. Speaking after the vote, Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Gennady Kuzmin described the move as an “illegitimate and politically motivated step” and said Russia had decided to quit the human rights council altogether. “You do not submit your resignation after you are fired,” Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya hit back. Russia-aligned hackers compromised the social media accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military officers, attempting to upload videos of defeated and surrendering Ukrainian soldiers before being stopped by Meta, a new report revealed. The report from Facebook and Instagram’s parent company detailed a surge in social media disinformation this year, including an increase in contentlinked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also indicated an uptick in domestic disinformation and propaganda in countries around the world, suggesting that tactics pioneered by foreign intelligence agencies are now being used more widely. “While much of the public attention in recent years has been focused on foreign interference, domestic threats are on the rise globally,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs. Russia and its allies are major players in the disinformation realm, according to the report, with groups linked to the Kremlin spreading disinformation about its invasion of Ukraine while amplifying pro-Russian conspiracy theories at home. Meta traced the effort to take over the social media accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military leaders back to a shadowy hacker organization known as Ghostwriter, has been previously linked to Russia’s ally Belarus. Ghostwriter has a history of spreading content critical of Nato, and has tried to hack email accounts. “This is a tried-and-true thing that they do,” said Ben Read, director of cyber-espionage analysis at Mandiant, a prominent US cybersecurity firm that has tracked Ghostwriter’s activities for years. Last year Mandiant said digital clues suggested the hackers were based in Belarus, though EU officials have previously blamed Russia. Read more: Wrapping up his address, Zelenskiy said he believed Russian propagandists are preparing a “mirror response” in Mariupol after the world reacted with revulsion at atrocities seen in Bucha. Specifically, he noted Russia would use “elaborated propaganda scenarios” to make it appear as though Ukrainian soldiers killed their own citizens in Mariupol. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable.” Zelenskiy said more countries are supporting Ukraine in the need for a “full and transparent investigation of all war crimes of the Russian occupiers” in Ukraine. “Every murder case will be solved. Each of the torturers will be found. All those who committed rape or looting will be identified. Responsibility is inevitable,” he said. Zelenskiy again pleaded for “bolder” sanctions against Russia and weapons. I emphasise once again: more sanctions are needed. Even bolder sanctions are needed. Courage must be a criterion for evaluating decisions. Courage and practicality. Weapons “will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones”, Zelenskiy added. Ukraine needs weapons that will allow us to win on the battlefield. And this will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has highlighted the bravery of his nation in his latest late-night national address. “Being brave is our brand,” he began. We have always been brave. The bravest in the world. I am sure of that. Because who else would do what Ukrainians do? Who else had so much courage to constantly fight against any manifestations of tyranny and defend freedom? In every election, in revolutions and in war. Who else had the courage to fight against all Russian forces on land, in the air and at sea? Who else had the courage to go unarmed against Russian armoured vehicles where the Russians temporarily managed to seize something? Who else had the courage to tell the world that hypocrisy is a bad weapon? And not just to tell, but to convince and restore honesty in the world. Who else had the courage to persuade the largest global companies to forget about accounting and recall morality? And to teach all political leaders - whatever they are - to be at least a little Ukrainian... At least a little brave. In fact, this is our brand. This is what it means to be us. To be Ukrainians. To be brave. “If everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all,” Zelenskiy added. “There would be no danger to the freedom of the nations. We will spread our courage. We will start a special global campaign. We will teach the world to be not just a little bit, but full of courage. Like us, like Ukrainians.” The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the Greek parliament to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in Mariupol, which has had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries. In his latest address, Ukrainian president Zelenskiy said that the “Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights.” In Mariupol, he said, “the same cruelty, the same heinous crimes” that occurred in , in Bucha and in the Kyiv region” are being replicated, accusing Russian forces of re-staging the war to suit their country’s propaganda. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns.

Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted, in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. US general Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had grim warnings for the millions desperately hoping Putin sees sense and stop the attack on Ukraine.“It’s going to be a long slog,” Milley told the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington, DC. Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. The Nobel laureate editor-in-chief of the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta was attacked with red paint while he was on a train, he said.The investigative newspaper had suspended publishing until the end of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after Russia’s communications regulator warned them to cease their reporting. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Joanna Walters, Guardian staff Canada has earmarked an additional 1b Canadian dollars in loans and 500m in military aid to Ukraine. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that “Putin’s assault has been so vicious that we all now understand that the world’s democracies - including our own - can be safe only if the Russian tyrant and his criminal armies are entirely vanquished,” in a speech to parliament. “It is in our urgent national interest to ensure they have the missiles and the money they need to win,” she said. So far, Canada has offered $90m in military aid $180 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. “It was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,” Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and “options for further military support”, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included “defensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles”. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine’s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas.

AFP reports: European Council chief Charles Michel on Thursday backed a proposal to release an additional 500m euros ($540m) to provide arms for Ukraine. “Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5b euros the EU support already provided for military equipment for \u001dUkraine,” Michel tweeted, also thanking EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell for proposing the extra funding. The proposal was agreed on Thursday by the 27 EU nations at ambassador level. The EU has already agreed a 1b euro package to provide arms for Kyiv. “This may seem like a lot, but one billion euros is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us,” Borrell said on Wednesday. The money comes from a 5 billion euro European peace fund set up by members states. In his latest address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the “Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights.” In Mariupol, he said, “the same cruelty, the same heinous crimes” that occurred in , in Bucha and in the Kyiv region” are being replicated: More and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a “mirror response” to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable. Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily with a jacket covering his head. “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man in the video can be heard saying in Russian – a language widely spoken in Ukraine. A soldier then shoots him in the head twice. He continues to move, so the soldier shoots again, and he stops. A soldier can then be heard shouting “Glory to Ukraine”. A man responds with the phrase: “Glory to heroes.” The audio ends with a man saying: “Do not [expletive] come to our land.” The living soldiers in the video are wearing the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow on their arms, while the men on the floor wear white armbands, the colour of Russian troops. A few metres away from the bodies is a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle which is used by the Russian airborne unit. BBC investigators attempted to biometrically match the face of one of the men in the video, who can be seen facing the camera with a distinctive beard. They found a match to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but are yet to confirm his identity. The broadcaster believes the word “Gruziny” – which means Georgians in Russian – can also be heard. Scenes in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the main road outside Dmytrivka, which is about seven miles south-west of Bucha with roads to Irpin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would “definitely be investigated”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had not seen the video, but stated: “I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable.” A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict.

Reuters reports: Lying on plastic mattresses, hundreds of Ukrainians including families waited in a crowded shelter run by the local government in the Mexican border city of Tijuana this week. Enrique Lucero, director of the city’s immigration services, said about 2,829 Ukrainians were waiting, more than double the 1,200 counted last Friday. Nearly two-thirds of them were in shelters, with the rest in hotels and churches, he said. The number of Ukrainians at the border is also increasing as US processing of claims fails to keep up with new arrivals, he said. Lucero said that US authorities had promised to speed up asylum applications to process up to 578 a day. The US government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Having housed Haitians and Central Americans who arrived in caravans in 2018, the Benito Juarez sports center once again became an emergency shelter over the weekend. Joe Biden said late last month his country would receive up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The Nobel laureate editor-in-chief of the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta was attacked with red paint while he was on a train, he said. The investigative newspaper suspended publishing until the end of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after Russia’s communications regulator warned them to cease its reporting. Muratov appears to have been attacked while he was in the sleeping compartment of a train, in pictures posted to Telegram and Twitter. “They poured oil paint with acetone all over the compartment. Eyes burning badly,” Muratov said. The US congress has approved one measure to remove Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status and another to ban oil imports from Russia. Joe Biden is expected to sign both measures into law. The measure amending Russia’s trade status clears the way for the Biden administration to raise tariffs on Russian imports. “Putin must absolutely be held accountable for the detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine” said senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “This package is about bringing every tool of economic pressure to bear onVladimir Putin and his oligarch cronies, said Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “Putin’s Russia does not deserve to be a part of the economic order that has existed since the end of World War Two.” Also in the committee hearing in Washington on Thursday, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said that Moscow has, essentially, stopped taking Washington’s calls on military matters and there had been no dialogue between the two countries since mid-February. “We’ve not been very successful because the Russians have not responded,” Austin said, declaring himself disappointed at the situation. But he added: “Based upon what they’ve done, nothing surprises me. And it doesn’t mean that we’ll stop reaching out to engage them Austin chimed with Milley on grim prospects for the south-east of Ukraine at this point. But he asserted that Russian president Vladimir Putin has given up on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. “Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city, he was wrong,” Austin said. He added: “Putin has probably has given up on that.” The top of the US military top brass testified in Congress earlier on Thursday and the head figure of General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had grim warnings for the millions desperately hoping Russian president Vladimir Putin sees sense and stop the attack on Ukraine. “Ideally, Putin decides to cease fire, stops his aggression, and there’s some sort of diplomatic intervention, but right now that doesn’t look like it’s on the immediate horizon. It’s going to be a long slog,” Milley told the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington, DC. Bearing in mind that regional leaders are begging remaining residents in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine to leave while they have a “last chance” before an expected renewed Russian offensive, Milley added his voice to warnings. “There’s a significant battle yet ahead down in the south-east, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to amass forces and continue their assault,” he told the panel. The US and NATO did not agree to supply fighter jets to Ukraine or other heavy weaponry, and did not step in to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine because of the stated risk that the west could be drawn into a direct war with Russia in that situation. But Milley said the US and its allies have delivered around 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems and 60,000 anti-tank systems. This has helped Ukraine prevent Putin’s forces from achieving air superiority, despite Russia’s devastating bombardment of parts of the country. A Ukrainian official is warning residents in the east that they have a “last chance” to flee before a major Russian offensive expected in the Donbas region, AFP writes. These few days may be the last chance to leave” and Russia was “trying to cut off all possible ways of getting people out,” Sergiy Gaiday, governor of the Lugansk region, part of the Donbas, where the city of Severodonetsk is coming under sustained artillery and rocket fire. However, trains evacuating residents are halted by Russian strikes on the only line still under Kyiv’s control, the head of the Ukrainian rail operator, Oleksandr Kamychin, said, describing it as a lifeline for tens of thousands. The enemy carried out strikes on the rail line next to the station in Barbenkovo on the Donetsk line,” he said in a post on the messaging service Telegram. “We’re waiting for the end of the bombardments to clarify the situation. The passengers on these trains have been moved into the station until this is done,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Cyprus to revoke passports issued to Russians through an investment scheme and stop relevant private yachts docking in its marinas. Zelenskiy made the plea during an address to the Cypriot parliament via live video link, the latest in a series of such speeches he has made to foreign legislatures after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. I’m grateful to you for your moral stance. You reacted to the Russian invasion and banned the docking of Russian ships in your ports... ...Stop Russian golden passports, dual citizenship. Except those where there is evidence they do not harm Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. He said that Cyprus has “tools to pressure” its traditionally close friend Russia, and urged Cypriot authorities to “close the ports” to all Russian private yachts. He called on the Cypriots to revoke passports issued to wealthy Russians under the disgraced citizenship-for-investment scheme shut down under corruption allegations in November 2020. After attending the session, Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades told reporters that instructions were given for revocation of four passports of Russians on the European Union’s sanctions list. During the investment scheme, Cyprus issued hundreds of passports to Russian nationals and their families. In November 2020, the Mediterranean island dropped the initiative after Al Jazeera aired a documentary showing reporters posing as fixers for a Chinese businessman seeking a Cypriot passport despite having a criminal record. A public inquiry found that around half of the 6,779 passports issued under the programme were granted illegally. Cyprus, a European Union member, allowed investors to acquire a passport in exchange for an investment of $2.5 million euros (US $3 million). During the 20-minute speech, a short video showed bomb-scarred cities like Mariupol and the bodies of Ukrainian civilians. Cyprus has sent more than 215 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, its largest contribution overseas. It has also received around 10,000 Ukrainian refugees in a country with a relatively large Russian diaspora. A protest against the war took place outside parliament during the session. At least one person was killed and 14 wounded in shelling on Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv earlier today, the regional governor Oleh Synehubov said in an online video address, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military earlier said Russian troops were bombarding the city with shells and rockets. Russia denies targeting civilians. We’ll have more on this shortly. But Synehubov has accused the Russians of pounding civilian infrastructure. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry had said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. When this report came out about 11 hours ago, there was no independent verification of the news. Details are sparse. But we’ll bring you more on what Oleh Synehubov has said as soon as we get it. It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the Greek parliament to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in Mariupol, which has had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, ministers spoke of “haunting” photographs of mutilated bodies, alleged executions and reports of sexual assaults by Russian troops. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted, in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. Thank you for reading. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the town of Borodyanka, around 25km west of Bucha, Reuters reports. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Speaking in a televised briefing, Venediktova said: Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about [the number of] victims. On Tuesday, Venediktova said the number of victims in Borodyanka would be higher than anywhere else, but did not provide further details. The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia invaded Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. In an interview with Sky News, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was asked whether the war had amounted to a humiliation for Russia given the number of troops lost. Peskov replied: We have significant losses of troops. And it’s a huge tragedy for us. He did not specific a casualty toll. In late March, Russia said it had lost 1,351 soldiers, with another 3,825 wounded. By contrast, a senior Nato official estimated in late March that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in four weeks of fighting in Ukraine. Peskov said Russia was “sorry” about its suspension from the UN’s human rights council over its invasion of Ukraine, adding: We’ll continue to defend our interests using every possible legal means. He also insisted Russian forces were “never shelling civilian objects” since the beginning of the war, claiming: They were just aiming and using high-precision missiles to attack military infrastructure in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman also claimed that the horrifying images that have emerged from Bucha over the last week were “fabricated and fake”. When asked if he realised “how grotesque” that sounded, Peskov replied: It’s a bold fake and we’ve been speaking about that for a couple of days but no one would listen to us. The aggressive debunking of “fakes” has become a key component of Russia’s propaganda war in Ukraine. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. It was the only Ukrainian-controlled railway exit from the northern part of Donetsk region, according to reports. From Ukrainian MP, Lesia Vasylenko: Note: the Guardian has not yet been able to verify these reports. Here’s more on the UN general assembly vote to suspend Russia from the UN’s human rights council. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the resolution and 58 countries abstained. Twenty-four member countries voted against the motion, including Belarus, China, Iran, Russia and Syria. Here’s the full list: It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, reporting from London, I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is being interviewed by Sky News, which asked him whether Russia was determined to take the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol “whatever the cost of human life”. Peskov replied: Mariupol is going to liberated from nationalistic battalions. We hope it will happen sooner rather than later. He reiterated Russia’s claim that the maternity ward bombing in Mariupol last month was “fake”. The hospital was a fake hospital. It was a fake and we have very serious reasons to believe that it was a fake. At least four people were reportedly killed and 16 injured in the Russian bombing of the children’s hospital and maternity ward, including a child, prompting outrage from Ukrainians and the world. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to UN member states who “chose the right side of history” and voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Kuleba said: War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. In a draft of the resolution, the 193-member general assembly expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine”, particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia. In a video address to the Greek parliament, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the country to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in the devastated city of Mariupol, Reuters reports. Some 100,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, Zelenskiy told Greek lawmakers, urging: We must save whoever we can. The Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Odesa, which both have had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries, needed “immediate assistance”, he said. Please use your influence as EU members to better organise whatever rescue can be carried out in Mariupol. He also called for stronger bans on Russian banks and tankers, urging the EU to “shut the door” so Russian banks could not make money on the global credit system. Zelenskiy received a standing ovation in parliament at the close of his speech, which was boycotted by the Greek communists and a small nationalist party. Earlier today, Greece’s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would call on the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate “crimes of war” in Mariupol, telling reporters: Greece has a specific, special interest for Mariupol because of the existence of a 100,000 and more Greek community in Mariupol. The World Health Organization (WHO) is preparing for possible “chemical assaults” in Ukraine, the body’s European head, Hans Kluge, said, Reuters reports. Speaking during a briefing from Lviv, Ukraine, he said: Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse. WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults. Kluge declined to give further details about the WHO’s preparations. Asked about a possible Russian chemical attack on Ukraine, he responded: The short answer is that WHO is preparing for any eventuality within our mandate. Our foreign correspondent Luke Harding interviews a witness to the bombing of Mariupol’s drama theatre who fled by swimming along the shoreline to reach Ukrainian-controlled territory. Dmitry Yurin was at home on 16 March when a Russian bomb struck Mariupol’s drama theatre. His flat in Prospect Mira was a couple of hundred metres away, across a square with a fountain. The theatre had become a capacious air raid shelter. Hundreds of women and children were inside. “It was terrible, a massive blast, an enormous explosion. I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood. Nearby a woman lay motionless on the ground. Family members were desperately attempting to resuscitate her, pressing on her chest. They were trying to bring her back. There was a child standing next to her, saying: ‘Mum, don’t sleep.’ The woman was dead. The exact number of people who perished in the Russian airstrike is still unknown. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says 300 people were killed. Witnesses including Yurin confirm there were dozens of bodies. They say continuous Russian shelling made rescue work dangerous. Yurin said he went back to the garage where he had been sheltering with his mother, Nadezhda, lit a cigarette and swallowed some tablets. He decided he had to get out of Mariupol, which for two gruesome weeks Russian forces had attacked and besieged. The city was cut off from all directions. He came up with an extraordinary plan. Yurin decided he would swim to safety. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was speaking earlier to reporters after meeting with Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, where he urged weapons to be sent to Kyiv now or “your help will come too late”, AFP reports. Kuleba said: Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late. He said he had “no doubts” that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. The question is the timeline. This discussion is not about the list of weapons. The discussion is about the timeline. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is addressing the media after today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. He warned the war could last for years, and said the key to an early solution was down to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said: The easiest way to end this war is for President Putin to pull back all its troops, and to end the war, and to sit down and engage in in serious diplomatic efforts to find the solution. But we need to be realistic, and we have no indications that President Putin has changed his over overall goal, and that is to control Ukraine and to achieve significant military victories on the battleground. What we see is Russian regrouping and repositioning their forces moving out of northern Ukraine, but at the same time moving those forces to the east and we expect a big battle in Donbas. And that’s the reason why allies also highlighted today the urgency of providing more support to Ukraine. That’s the reason why also allies are imposing heavy costs on President Putin and Russia. But at the same time, we are prepared for the long haul. This war may last for weeks, but also months, and possibly also for years. And therefore we need to prepare for a lot more. He also warned that as long as the war continued, there would be a risk of the war escalating, saying: If the war is going to drag on then the risk is first and foremost for the people of Ukraine who will suffer more, we’ll see more damage, more death and more destruction. But of course, as long as the war continues, there will be a risk for escalation beyond the Ukraine. And that’s exactly what Nato is focused on, to prevent that escalation. There are two areas where the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has been saying he is unable to provide more detail. Firstly, this is on the exact nature of weapon supplies to Ukraine. He was keen to paint a picture of continuing support of Ukraine from Nato since 2014. I fully understand that you’re asking specific questions about specific types of weapons. At the same time, I think it’s important to understand that I believe it is better often to not be specific exactly about what kind of systems, but rest assured allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems. Nato have supported Ukraine for many years since the illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia’s first invasion in 2014 also into Donbas. Nato allies and Nato have provided significant support with equipment with training tens of thousand of soldiers. And then when we saw the intelligence indicating a highly likely invasion we stepped up last autumn. He was then asked a specific question about a video that has emerged which appears to show Ukrainian forces shooting a Russian soldier who has been captured. Stoltenberg said he was unfamiliar with the specific video, but said: I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable. On the global and long-lasting impact of Russia’s aggression, Stoltenberg said: What is happening in Ukraine is being closely watched around the world. We have seen that China is unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression. And Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of nations to choose their own path. This is a serious challenge. The sanctions introduced by Nato allies and our partners are unprecedented, and they are damaging. He said that Nato’s new strategy would take into account this global shift and “deliver a response on how we relate to Russia in the future”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that some of the package to help “brave Ukrainians” to “defend their homes and the country and push back the invading forces” included “stepping up humanitarian aid and financial support”. He said: We discussed what more we will do, including cybersecurity assistance, and providing the equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical and biological threats. Jens Stoltenberg has announced that Nato will be making moves to provide more support to Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. For Georgia, we could increase our support through the substantial Nato Georgia package, including in areas like situational awareness, secure communications, and cyber. For Bosnia-Herzegovina. We could develop a new defence capacity-building package, and assistance will be tailored, demand-driven, and delivered with the full consent of the countries concerned. He stressed that nations such as Finland, Sweden, Georgia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Australia and Japan, all non-Nato members, were at the meeting because Russia’s actions had a global security impact. Jens Stoltenberg is talking now. The video feed should be available above. The secretary general of Nato has started by saying that the organisation will do more now, and for the medium and longer term to support Ukraine. I will bring you the key quotes and lines. Turkey has been attempting to play a mediating role in events. It hosted a round of face-to-face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and this morning also hosted a video call with countries that border the Black Sea about the security situation there. Now the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said that he will be heading to Washington. Reuters reports he told the media after today’s Nato meeting that he had been invited by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to visit for talks on 18 May. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will be giving a press briefing shortly. We will have a live video stream embedded in the blog. You may need to refresh the page and press play in order to see it. Dmytro Kuleba has also told the media that the discussion at Nato was not about the list of weapons Ukraine would get, but rather about the timeline for when they would be given. The Ukrainian foreign minister said that he had no doubt that Ukraine would have the weapons necessary to fight. Reuters reports him reiterating that sanctions inflict damage on Russia, but are not enough alone to stop the war. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has warned at today’s meeting in Brussels that the scale of any impending Russian assault on Donbas will remind the Nato allies of the second world war. “Either you help us now - and I’m speaking about days, not weeks - or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Reuters reports him telling the media. That statement from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has received a curt reply from the Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak. He dismissed Lavrov’s comments that Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on. Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were “of purely propagandistic significance”. Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: “That is how any such statements should be regarded.” It is Martin Belam back here on the blog for now. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia will probably renew its attack on the Ukrainian capital if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. Speaking at an online briefing, Hruzevych said: It is likely the enemy has not given up the goal of a second attack on Kyiv – there is such a threat. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russia’s long-term objective is to seize all of Ukraine despite its short-term focus being the east of the country. Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops, she said. Malyar told a video briefing: The key objective of the Russian Federation was and is the capture of the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to do this quickly, but Putin’s blitzkrieg failed. Even so, Russia has not abandoned its plan to take the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia planned to achieve some “smaller objectives” in order to “show results”, she said. But in reality it is using any moment to gather its forces, to regroup its armies, in order to continue its assault. The enemy is learning how to fight us. If in the first days the Russian army was disorientated, then they are now adjusting to our tactics and strategy, and taking time ... in order to learn how to fight our strategy. A Ukrainian negotiator has accused Russian “propagandists” of being “as responsible for atrocities in Ukraine” as Russian troops. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Zelenskiy and a member of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia, said Moscow’s “hostility in media” must be reduced to prove it is ready for dialogue. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and the elderly to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions, Reuters reports. The mayor, Borys Filatov, said in an online video address: All those who have the ability, as I have already said, should leave. This involves women, children, the elderly, those who are not …. directly integrated into the economy. Dnipro, which usually has a population of almost one million people, has so far been spared the worst of the fighting that has devastated cities further east and south, such as Mariupol. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Boris Johnson described Russia’s actions in Ukraine as the “systematic slaughter of innocent people” but stopped short of using the word “genocide”, PA Media news agency reports. Johnson said: I think people are looking at what is happening in Ukraine and they can see this is systematic slaughter of innocent people. Whatever term you want to use, it is totally unconscionable, and the world is now overwhelmingly on the side of the Ukrainians. The UK will continue with our friends and partners to do everything we can to help. When asked about reports that the UK would be sending armoured vehicles to the Ukrainian army, he said the government was looking at what further military assistance it could give. Johnson said: We have tougher sanctions coming in today on [Russian state-owned] Sberbank, individuals, and we are certainly looking at what more military assistance we can give. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country must be involved in negotiations to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Lukashenko was quoted by the Belarusian state news agency Belta as saying that he expected to hold talks with Vladimir Putin in the next few days. Lukashenko said: There can be no separate agreements behind Belarus’s back. Since you dragged us into this – principally western countries – the position of Belarus naturally needs to be heard at these negotiations. Belarus’s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, insisted Lukashenko himself “must participate in the (final) meeting”. Lukashenko also claimed Belarus had been unfairly labelled “an accomplice of the aggressor” as a result of western sanctions. Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying: We do not need this war. Because as a result of this conflict between two Slavic peoples, we are the ones who may suffer the most. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Local news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Thursday that the country’s office had intercepted the radio messages and presented the findings in parliament. Separately, the Washington Post reported Germany’s foreign intelligence service claimed to have intercepted two separate communications, in which Russian soldiers described how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them. The Post cited an intelligence official it said was familiar with the findings. It was not clear in which part of Ukraine the recordings come from. The Kremlin said it was bewildered by the US decision to impose sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s daughters, describing the move as “difficult to understand and explain”, Reuters reports. The US announced fresh sanctions yesterday targeting the Russian leader’s two adult daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: Of course we consider these sanctions in themselves to be the extension of an absolutely rabid position on the imposition of restrictions. In any case, the ongoing line on imposing restrictions against family members speaks for itself. The Kremlin could not comprehend why Putin’s daughters would be targeted, he claimed. This is something that is difficult to understand and explain. Unfortunately, we have to deal with such opponents. Russian troops used civilians as human shields to try to protect themselves from a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces in a village in northern Ukraine, the BBC reports. Villagers from Obukhovychi, just south of the exclusion zone around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, said Russian troops were losing soldiers and armoured vehicles to a counter-attack from Ukrainian forces on the night of 14 March. They said Russian troops went door-to-door to round up about 150 people at gunpoint and held them in a freezing cold school gym as protection for Russian forces. Lydmila Sutkova, one of the villagers interviewed by the BBC, told them: They took us from the cellars where we were hiding and forced us out. Old ladies, children, everyone. It was terrifying. They broke open the doors of anyone who wouldn’t open up. Another villager, Maryana, said her daughter was still showing signs of anxiety since the night: A two-year-old girl should not see this. I was afraid that we would all be shot in that gym. I was scared for my daughter. I don’t have the words. When the Russian invasion reached Mariupol in Ukraine at the end of February, Alena Zagreba, 15, went from filming vlogs with her friends to chronicling the destruction of her home city. While most people hid in bunkers and cellars, Alena and her parents stayed above ground, and her videos are a rare insight into the intense attacks by Russian forces. Alena melted snow for water while her parents cooked on makeshift firepits outside. The family survived by moving from house to house as shelling made their home and other shelters uninhabitable. Alena said at one point in the diary that her nerves had been “destroyed” by the constant bombardment. Our Helena Smith watched Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy address the Greek parliament in Athens. Here is her report: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has received rapturous applause addressing the Greek parliament today. The leader went to the heart of the matter by kicking off his speech with mention of Mariupol, the strategically important south-eastern port city that has become a symbol of the suffering Ukraine has suffered at the hands of Russian forces. With over 100,000 ethnic Greeks living there the besieged town has a special place in Greek hearts, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has repeatedly said. “For over a month I have woken up every day thinking of Mariupol,” Zelenskiy told Greek MPs. “What has happened [there] has not happened in European history for more than half a century … Russian soldiers are destroying everything, they have bombed hospitals, maternity wards even the town’s municipal theatre. We have all seen these things, we have all seen what Russian pilots have done. Mariupol has been destroyed. This peaceful town has experienced the violence of Russian troops.” Appealing to Greek sensitivity regarding the presence of a once vibrant diaspora in the Black Sea region, Zelenskiy said there were now fears that the country would lose a large part of its identity “that Greek culture had brought”. “This was the cradle of the Greek community for centuries,” he said before two Ukrainian fighters of Greek heritage also addressed the chamber. Invoking the mantra of battle-hardened Greeks during the war of independence against the Ottoman empire which began in 1821, the Ukrainian leader added: “Your own revolutionaries said ‘freedom or death’ and that today is what we are saying. Beside Mariupol, Odesa, another big centre of Hellenism, is also threatened.” Zelenskiy also referred to the Filiki Etairia, a secret society of friends that was founded in Odesa with the aim of overthrowing Ottoman rule. “The Filiki Etairia was also created here and this is of huge significance,” he told lawmakers. “A Filiki Etairia could [now] be created in Greece [for the purpose of giving] immediate help which Mariupol and Odesa so need … With the practical solidarity of Greece we will be able to emerge victorious.” G7 foreign ministers have condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, they said: Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities and severe violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights, committed by the aggressor on Ukrainian soil. Ministers expressed their “heartfelt solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our deepest condolences to the victims”. We underline our unwavering support for Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders and express our readiness to assist further, including with military equipment and financial means, to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s aggression and to rebuild Ukraine. Russia should be suspended from the UN human rights council, they added. Ministers “welcome and support” the work to investigate and gather evidence of potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. They urged Russia to “withdraw completely its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders”. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including warplanes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda for when he spoke to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons.” The UN general assembly will vote later today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. There are to be 10 humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of the besieged city says more than 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons “will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has said the country needs financial assistance after the arrival of 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, many of them children, into his country. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. Ukraine and Hungary have again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claims is spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war. YouTube has suspended the account of Chinese national Wang Jixian in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her country was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. Austria, meanwhile, is to expel four Russian diplomats. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday called on the west to “bring Russia to justice”, saying Moscow’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe. “Once and for all, we can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors that those who choose war always lose ... those who blackmail Europe with economic and energy crisis always lose,” Zelenskiy said in an address to Greek lawmakers in Athens, speaking through an interpreter. Reuters reports that he reiterated calls that the democratic world reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. “Let us be honest, since the very beginning Russia’s actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe,” he said. He accused Russia of doing all it could economically to provoke inflation across the continent. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Hostomel and Borodyanka in Ukraine. The mayor of Mariupol says over 100,000 people still need urgent evacuation from the city, Reuters reports. There are set to be ten humanitarian corridors open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but earlier Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. “Pumping weapons into Ukraine will not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters when asked about US weapons supplies to Ukraine. “Of course this will most likely have a negative effect.” Reuters also reports these key lines from Peskov’s regular briefing: Peskov said sanctions being applied by the US on Putin’s family speak for themselves, and that it is hard to understand or explain the move He said Putin has yet to decide whether to attend the next G20 summit – which is due in Indonesia in November – and a decision will be taken according to how events unfold. Also on the energy side of things, Finland has said it will invest up to €850m (£700m) to ensure sufficient energy supply and to speed up breaking away from its dependence on Russian energy. Reuters reports the country will also acquire a new floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal together with Estonia to be placed in Finland to put an end to gas deliveries from Russia, minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila said The oil company Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of between $4bn and $5bn (£3.1bn and £3.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as the firm pulls back from the country. Bosses said they will no longer buy oil on the spot market but will continue to fulfil contracts on buying fuel from Russia signed before the invasion of Ukraine. PA Media quotes the company saying: “Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion.” The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, says Athens will ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in the besieged city of Mariupol. “Greece will request that the international court of justice investigate war crimes that have occurred in Mariupol,” he said in comments made before attending today’s meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. “Greece has a particular interest in Mariupol because of the Greek community of more than 100,000 people there. In addition I will ask my counterparts in the alliance to do the best that they can to [not only] help Ukraine but to protect Odesa, so that Odesa does not suffer the same fate as Mariupol.” Dendias, who led a humanitarian aid mission to the southern port city at the weekend, made the comments before Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses Athens’ 300-seat parliament today. During his trip to Odesa on Sunday, the Greek foreign minister also announced the reopening of Greece’s consulate there to help ethnic Greeks flee areas in the south-east that are now the focus of Russia’s military offensive. “The reopening of [Greece’s] consulate will help distribute humanitarian aid and set up corridors for the Greek ethnic community to leave from any areas of Ukraine, if needed, via Odesa,” he said. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine, and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. He said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. “The situation is under control,” he said on national television, Reuters reports. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Reuters reports that the Roskomnadzor watchdog accused YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally from using its platform, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes about the course of special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”. Russia has continued to officially describe its attack on Ukraine as a “special military operation”, and has made varying claims that images of atrocities that have emerged from Bucha and elsewhere in the country are a staged “provocation”. Ukraine’s foreign minister has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster the country’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato’s headquarters, where foreign ministers are due to meet today, Dmytro Kuleba said there were three items on his agenda: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. Here is the video clip: The UK’s Ministry of Defence have issued their latest assessment of the situation in the ground in Ukraine. They say: Progressing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine is the main focus of Russian military forces. Russian artillery and air strikes continue along the Donbas line of control. Russian strikes against infrastructure targets within the Ukrainian interior are likely intended to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian military to resupply and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government. Despite refocussing forces and logistics capabilities to support operations in the Donbas, Russian forces are likely to continue facing morale issues and shortages of supplies and personnel. Earlier the Russian defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv, which are all towards the east of Ukraine and the Donbas area. [see 8.32am] Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz has been on the media in the UK this morning, telling the BBC Today programme that the country needs financial assistance over the volume of Ukrainian refugees now in Poland. PA Media quotes him saying: They could offer a bit more financial support, you know, those 2.5 million people need accommodation. Half of them basically are kids, which we are successfully integrating to the Polish schooling system. But it also brings some costs. Suddenly, in a couple of weeks, we are 2.5 million bigger. So any kind of financial assistance would be very much welcome. Przydacz also said that he opposed countries having quotas on accepting refugees: These are our neighbours. Ukrainian friends are very much welcome to stay in Poland. People are free people. If they want to go to the Great Britain and the Great Britain is ready to host them - we have absolutely nothing against them. But we are strongly opposing the policy of quotas or forcing people to live in a country. Tension between Ukraine and Hungary has not eased this morning, with Reuters carrying quotes from two simultaneous briefings. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has this morning said that it considers Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Ukraine also said that Hungary’s stance over the allegations of Russian atrocities strengthens Russia’s sense of impunity and encourages Russia “to commit new atrocities against Ukrainians.” Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,” For their part, Hungary’s foreign minister Péter Szijjártó has confirmed that fuel for Hungary’s nuclear power plants has arrived by air from Russia. The Russian attack on Ukraine has made shipments by rail impossible. He has restated that Hungary does not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. He added that imposing any sanctions on activities related to nuclear energy would also be a “red line” for Hungary. There has been an increasing tension between Hungary and Ukraine in the last few days. Viktor Orbán described Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as one of the enemies he “over-powered” with his election victory at the weekend. For his part, Zelenskiy said Orbán was frightened of Moscow and needed to choose between Russia and the “other world”. The two countries share about 135 km (85 miles) of border, roughly following the Tisza river to the west of Ukraine. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries have held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish Defence Ministry said, adding the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Reuters reports from Ankara that in a statement, Turkey said the defence ministers of Bulgaria, Georgia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine had met via video conference upon the invitation of Turkey, adding they held “very efficient” talks. “Aside from the mines, the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea for peace, calm and stability was emphasised,” Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, who participated in the call, said after the meeting. According to his ministry, the ministers discussed possible steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and get aid to Ukraine. Turkish military diving teams have so far detonated three separate floating naval mines in the Black Sea, while Romania has also defused a stray mine in its waters since the Ukraine war. A quick Reuters snap here that Russia’s defence ministry says it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuchiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the southeast of the country. There is as yet no independent verification of this claim. Yesterday the Ukrainian State Emergency Service released images of firefighters working to extinguish flames at a fuel storage depot that had been struck in the Dnipropetrovsk region. A quick quote from UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in Brussels here, after she briefly spoke to the media ahead of today’s round of meetings. She said in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine: “the G7 and Nato is stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons. The UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy. We’re sanctioning more banks, and we’re stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.” Mark Voyger is an expert on eastern Europe and Russia – he is a non-resident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Analysis – and he has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK, and made two particularly interesting points. Speaking from Warsaw, on the issue of the Black Sea, he was in favour of Nato patrolling it to deter Russian military activity. He said: The Black Sea is now being turned into a Russian lake just like the Azov Sea was, and the Black Sea actually is shared by multiple Nato members: Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey. So I would say ultimately we need to do that. If there is no no-fly zone, if we feel reluctant to impose it, we can do something about a no-sail zone, if you will, in the Black Sea, because Russia has been targeting international navigation. He was asked who was winning the war, and he had this to say: Ukraine is winning it on the ground, tactically, operationally, internationally, strategically. I will say information-wise, the information warfare is definitely critical. Unfortunately, you know, Putin is still in power and he’s winning the war at home. He is slowly but surely recreating the Soviet system – a totalitarian system that bans all dissent and stifles access to free information. So internationally, Ukraine is winning. Domestically, Russia is winning, until such time that we’re able to penetrate through this thick wall of lies and propaganda and convince the Russian people that he’s bad even for Russian. Foreign minister Marise Payne said this that Australia was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. “Today, I’m announcing 67 further sanctions of Russian elites and oligarchs, those close to Putin who facilitate and support his outrageous actions,” Reuters reports she told reporters as she arrived at Nato. Australia is not a member of Nato, but like Japan, is present at today’s meeting as a guest. Austria is the latest European country to announce diplomatic sanctions against Russia. This morning the foreign ministry there has announced that it is expelling three Russian diplomat from the embassy in Vienna, and one from the consulate in Salzburg. Reuters reports that a foreign ministry spokesperson said the Russian officials had behaved in a way that was incompatible with their diplomatic status. They must leave the country by 12 April. There has been a wave of expulsions of Russian diplomatic staff – although some countries, notably Britain, Canada and Australia, have yet to take any action. Here’s the video clip of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying that Russia will regard weak sanctions as “permission to attack”. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has posted some pictures of him in his Nato meetings in Brussels, and has repeated his “three things” line: Met with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at Nato HQ in Brussels. I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. Ukraine’s urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail. Yesterday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the EU has given €35bn to Russia in energy payments since the start of the war, compared to €1bn given to Ukraine in arms and weapons. There’s no sign of that changing any time soon. Russian state-owned gas producer Gazprom said today it continued to supply natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday in line with requests from European consumers. Requests stood at 105.4 million cubic metres for 7 April, slightly down on the day before. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, has announced that Ukraine is aiming to open ten humanitarian corridors on Thursday. Residents trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol will again have to use their own vehicles. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has just published some images of people being evacuated within the country. They say: The State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Donetsk region evacuated 198 people on April 6, 45 of them children. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has just tweeted out a response to developments in the US. He said: Grateful to the US Senate for passing the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. Important first step towards a lend-lease program to expedite the delivery of military equipment to Ukraine. Looking forward to its swift passage in the House and signing by the US President. This is Martin Belam here in London taking over the blog from Samantha Lock. You can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is currently under investigation has increased to 4,820 according to a recent update from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. It is also believed that 167 children have been killed in Ukraine as result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where Nato foreign ministers are meeting later today, Kuleba said there are three items on his agenda when he talks to the allies and holds bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The Ukrainian foreign minister said there is no distinction between offensive and defensive weapons - any weapons, including tanks and fast jets, would be used to defend Ukraine. He added that any country making this distinction are being hypocritical. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.” Russia is focusing on an impending offensive operation in eastern Ukraine with the aim to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine’s ministry of defence has said, corroborating western intelligence report. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said some withdrawn Russian units are now located in “tent camps” in a number of regions bordering Ukraine. “The Russian servicemen refuse to take part in further hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. The moral and psychological condition of these personnel is low and tends to deteriorate,” an operational report published this morning reads. Russia “continues to look for ways to solve the problem of replenishing its units with human resources” and has “stepped up work with conscripts who have been discharged from military service since 2012” officials added. The Russian occupiers continue to use violence against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories and are forcible deporting residents of Mariupol to the temporarily occupied districts of Donetsk, the report claimed. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boichenko noted that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko also said that more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed due to Russian bombardments. The Russian military has besieged the port city, cutting off access to food, water and energy supplies while continually dropping artillery and air raids on the town. On Wednesday, about 1,000 people were able to make it out of the besieged port city in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. The ICRC team had tried for five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, coming within 12 miles of the city, but security conditions made it impossible to enter. Ukrainian officials said the Russian military had pounded the city over the past 24 hours, with 118 airstrikes. They also said Russian soldiers were gathering bodies in order to destroy evidence of war crimes. A mobile crematorium was going from street to street, collecting and disposing of corpses from people killed by shelling and shooting. In its latest assessment, the UK’s ministry of defence said the humanitarian situation in Mariupol was deteriorating. “More than 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender,” it said. Russia is blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV, he said: I think Russia is afraid that [if] we successfully send humanitarian aid to Mariupol, then the whole world will see what’s going on here. Russia doesn’t want anything to be seen until they take control of the city until they clean it all up. Mariupol is hell right now. Thousands have either been killed or injured. The number of those killed and injured is increasing day by day ... we do not have clear information on the number of those who lost their lives. They are trying to cover up the situation. In this case, they are trying to prevent the humanitarian supply. They will not be able to cover up everything. They will not be able to bury or hide thousands of people. The world has seen the real situation. It has seen what has been done to a Ukrainian city.” Zelenskiy said that Russia had already attempted to conceal evidence of crimes in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv and several nearby communities, where Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of carrying out widespread killings of civilians. “They burned families. Families. Yesterday we found again a new family: father, mother, two children. Little, little children, two. One was a little hand, you know,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I said ‘they are Nazis’.” Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. Vereshchuk said authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas. YouTube has suspended the account of a Chinese national in Odessa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”, the Guardian’s Rhoda Kwan reports from Taipei. Wang Jixian, whose daily Mandarin vlogs detailing his life in the Ukrainian city made him an internet sensation, was temporarily suspended on Thursday last week. In his video immediately before the suspension, his video showed Chinese translations of a voice recording of Ukrainians speaking about atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. The Beijing native began posting daily vlogs on his YouTube channel shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “Today is … I am still in Odesa. I am still alive,” his videos begin. His daily updates quickly drew more than 100,000 followers but also the ire of China’s legions of nationalistic netizens. His channel suddenly went quiet last week. Read the full story below. Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. Here are some of the latest images to come from Ukraine today. In Bucha, two young girls walks hand-in-hand past destroyed Russian military machinery littering the main town street. A child’s teddy bear hangs from a tree in front of a building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka while a damaged playground is seen next to a heavily damaged apartment building in Hostomel. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.” Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels today to address Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”, the alliance said. Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine. We now see a significant movement of troops away from Kyiv, to regroup, re-arm and resupply, and they shift their focus to the east,” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said ahead of the meeting. Targeting and murdering civilians is a war crime. All the facts must be established and all those responsible for these atrocities must be brought to justice,” Stoltenberg added, commenting on the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities. Ministers will arrive for talks from 3:30pm local time (2:30pm GMT) and will be joined by their counterparts from Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Georgia, and the European Union, and by Nato’s Asia-Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. “At a time when authoritarian powers are pushing back on the rules-based international order, it is even more important for democracies to stand together, and protect our values,” Stoltenberg said in a statement published by Nato. Allies are stepping up their support for Ukraine’s right to defend itself, including with anti-tank weapons, air-defence systems and other equipment, as well as increased humanitarian assistance and financial aid.” Allied foreign ministers will also discuss the development of Nato’s next strategic concept, to guide the Alliance’s adaptation to the new global security reality. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. In his daily address on Thursday, he called for the democratic world to reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy said the west’s hesitation to agree on an oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives. Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously, he added. The US, UK and EU unveiled new sanctions against Moscow. US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK will impose an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, place sanctions on eight more oligarchs and end imports of oil and coal by next year, foreign secretary Liz Truss said. The EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Nato’s foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on bringing an end to the war. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Zelenskiy said Kremlin forces were trying to cover up evidence of atrocities. “We have information that the Russian military has changed its tactics and is trying to remove people who have been killed from streets and basements ... this is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more,” he said Thursday, but did not provide evidence. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with Ukraine authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. It comes as western officials say Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer. Russia is hiding ‘thousands’ killed in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, the president said. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion, the mayor of the besieged city said. Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 people were burned to death. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to access the city, about 1,000 people made it out of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. A total of 4,892 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities on Wednesday using humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already in the US before Russia invaded their country. Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state said. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/sep/25/bond-fundraiser-no-long-term-fix-for-aston-martin","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-26T09:58:58Z","webTitle":"Aston Martin needs to have a proper look under the bonnet | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/sep/25/bond-fundraiser-no-long-term-fix-for-aston-martin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/sep/25/bond-fundraiser-no-long-term-fix-for-aston-martin","fields":{"headline":"Aston Martin needs to have a proper look under the bonnet","bodyText":"Here comes Aston Martin with news of its “successful” placing of $150m (£120m) worth of bonds. Success, in this context, merely means the company got its cash. Everything else about the fundraising screams of desperation on the part of the borrower. Aston Martin will pay interest at 12%, a corporate pauper’s rate. A second $100m bond will have to be pitched at 15% if sales targets on the new SUV model are not met. It is quite a reversal: as recently as April, there were buyers for new Aston Martin IOUs at 6.5%. What’s changed? There was a hefty profits warning in July, blamed on “macroeconomic headwinds”. More fundamentally, the suckers who bought shares at £19 in last October’s flotation have come to understand that the listing, marshalled by 12 generously remunerated investment banks and promoters, was over-revved. The shares have fallen 70% and sit at 551p. “We don’t make cars – we make dreams,” declared the chief executive, Andy Palmer, during his pitch to investors who must have been half-asleep. Absurdly, the £4bn float raised no new money to strengthen a debt-heavy balance sheet created by private equity owners. Aston Martin, in effect, was betting that trading conditions would be near perfect ahead of the launch of the DBX, its first SUV, in December. Life rarely proceeds so happily in the luxury car trade. Net debt was £732m at the end of June, a huge sum versus “adjusted” operating profits of £147m last year, so one could say Aston Martin has done well even to issue bonds at 12%. The extra funding at least allows a calmer lead-up to the launch of the new vehicle but the wider position has not changed radically. If the DBX flops, the balance sheet will require a proper overhaul – the one it should have had before arrival on the public markets. One can grumble about the greed of the Italian and Kuwaiti owners who flogged a quarter of their holdings in the float. But the blame mostly lies with the fund managers, some of them managing our pensions. It was their job to kick the tyres. Instead, they acted like members of the Aston Martin fan club. EDF poses a nuclear cost risk Quelle surprise! EDF, the French folk whose nuclear power station in Flamanville in Normandy is three times over budget and still not built, reckon their construction at Hinkley Point C will also arrive on the high side. Hinkley was originally meant to cost £18bn. The figure was revised to £19.6bn in 2017. Now, having found the soil in Somerset to be “challenging”, EDF is shooting for £21.5bn to £22.5bn. One can, of course, take comfort that EDF, and not UK billpayers, will bear the cost of the cost overrun. That was the sole consolation in a deal that obliges consumers to buy Hinkley’s juice at sky-high prices for 35 years. But one cannot relax. Sizewell C looms as EDF’s next project and the government is contemplating obliging consumers to carry some of the construction risks in Suffolk. This is a “regulated asset base” (RAB) model. Under RAB, consumers would start to pay for a plant before it is built but the electricity at the end would be cheaper. Sizewell, it is suggested, is a suitable candidate for RAB because EDF will merely be replicating its Hinkley plant and will start with greater engineering experience. Well, it’s an idea and, clearly, the appeal of the trade-off will depend on the terms. EDF would still have to be on the hook for, say, a 20% cost overrun. But if the electricity were to be substantially cheaper than Hinkley’s, there might be a deal to be done if more nuclear-generated power is deemed essential for baseload supplies. But there are two reasons to be cautious. First, note the warning of the National Infrastructure Commission in a report last year: “There is limited experience of using the RAB model for anything as complex or as risky as nuclear.” Second, EDF’s latest estimate for Hinkley may not be its last. Every upwards revision weakens the case for RAB – and the argument was already in borderline territory. M&amp;G boss manages to rise above The asset manager M&amp;G, demerging from the Prudential, is coming to the FTSE 100 index soon. Like all shiny-faced newcomers, it wants to show it is playing fair with executive pensions. Thus boss John Foley’s pension contribution has been cut from 25% of salary to 13%, in line with the workforce. Luckily for Foley, however, his basic salary has been increased from £781,000 in 2018 to £980,000, which more than compensates for the pension change. Solidarity should not prove too irksome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/dec/20/us-briefing-democratic-debate-impeachment-and-violent-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-20T11:05:09Z","webTitle":"US briefing: Democratic debate, impeachment and violent cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/20/us-briefing-democratic-debate-impeachment-and-violent-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/dec/20/us-briefing-democratic-debate-impeachment-and-violent-cities","fields":{"headline":"US briefing: Democratic debate, impeachment and violent cities","bodyText":"Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories.

The South Bend mayor was criticised by Elizabeth Warren on his fundraising from wealthy donors and by Amy Klobuchar on his lack of experience. But there was no clear winner, writes Nathan Robinson – and, notably, little discussion of Donald Trump’s impeachment. Sarah Sanders. The former White House press secretary has apologised and deleted a tweet she had posted during the debate in which she appeared to mock Joe Biden’s lifelong struggle with a stutter. China blackout.

Pelosi and McConnell face off over impeachment next steps Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell, the two most powerful figures in Congress, are gearing up for a showdown over the next stage of the impeachment process. Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, has delayed the delivery of articles of impeachment to the Senate in order to cajole McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, into holding a substantive trial rather than the swift, cursory acquittal that Trump’s defenders may be hoping for. New standards. McConnell slammed Pelosi’s tactics. Tom McCarthy asks what sort of standard Republicans will set in how they ultimately decide to conduct the impeachment trial. Christianity Today. The evangelical Christian magazine founded by Billy Graham has called for Trump’s removal from office following his impeachment, in a break from the president’s typically staunch evangelical support. Justice department plans crackdown on violent cities The justice department has unveiled plans for a crackdown on violent crime in seven US cities. William Barr, the attorney general, outlined Operation Relentless Pursuit at a press conference in Detroit on Thursday, flanked by the leaders of several federal law enforcement agencies. The plan will increase the federal law enforcement presence in Detroit, Albuquerque, Baltimore, Cleveland, Kansas City, Memphis and Milwaukee, which have crime rates higher than the national average. Tough on crime. Barr was also known for his tough-on-crime approach as attorney general in George HW Bush’s administration during the early 1990s, when the national crime rate was at its peak. Weinstein accused of sexual assault on teen in fresh lawsuit A Polish former model has filed a fresh lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, accusing the disgraced producer of sexually assaulting her when she was a 16-year-old aspiring actor. After remaining anonymous as part of a previous class-action lawsuit, Kaja Sokola has gone public with her new suit, saying she “cannot accept … as fair or just” the $25m settlement reportedly reached between Weinstein and dozens of his alleged victims, which would not require him to admit wrongdoing or to pay a penny from his own pocket. No accountability. Of the settlement, Sokola said: “There is no accountability for the perpetrators, insufficient compensation for all of the victims, and millions of dollars going to people that I believe enabled Weinstein.” Weinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Martin Scorsese on making 2019’s best movie The Guardian’s film critic Peter Bradshaw has crowned Martin Scorsese’s 209-minute crime epic The Irishman his No 1 film of 2019. Scorsese tells Andrew Pulver why his latest film felt like a culmination: “I know that I’m at the end of a long, long ride.” Opinion If you thought impeachment would pose a reporting challenge for conservative media, think again, says Jason Wilson. The president’s defenders have once again used the news as an excuse to attack his perceived enemies and to explain why this is actually good for Trump. A careful and rigorous impeachment process appears to have changed few minds. Conservative media are working to ensure that its aftermath doesn’t either.

Politicians were rated from 0% to 100% based on 16 key parliamentary votes that would affect the UK’s carbon emissions. The votes were chosen by the Guardian and DeSmog UK with additional consultations with Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other sources. A detailed breakdown of the methodology can be found here. The Guardian also compiled publicly available information about donations, salaries, gifts and other interests registered by MPs that are linked to the fossil fuel industries. The analysis has already provoked strong reactions from some MPs, while others – even those with modest scores – recognised it was an important exercise that would stimulate debate between voters and the people who represent them. The sole criteria in assessing MPs’ scores was whether their votes were likely to increase or reduce emissions. So, votes for fracking and Heathrow expansion were considered negative because those bills encouraged more carbon-intensive gas production and airline travel. But votes for onshore wind and subsidies for renewable energy were deemed positive because those bills would have accelerated the shift to a low-carbon economy. For this analysis, a vote for nuclear power was judged positive in purely climate terms, even though there are many other serious environmental and economic concerns about this form of energy. Motions passed without a recorded vote could not be included in the scores. In addition, the Guardian looked at information taken from the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests that showed donations, salaries or benefits from fossil fuel companies, aviation firms or individuals and organisations that deny the need for urgent climate action. The results are not intended as the final word on whether an MP is for or against climate action, and there are limitations to the methodology used. For example, it is difficult to quantify the work politicians do in committees, mobilising colleagues, spending time on climate issues or speaking out in the House of Commons. Individual MPs’ votes are also heavily influenced by the party whip. Yet academics and campaigners said they hoped the analysis would spur a debate about why parliament is not doing more to cut the UK’s emissions. “Every MP will look at this list and say: ‘Why am I there?’ They will have to justify their position,” said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global warming. The analysis also comes at a critical moment, before a likely general election that could leave the winning party in power until 2025 – halfway through the decade in which scientists warn that humankind must make a decisive shift away from fossil fuels and other sources of carbon emissions. The current government already claims to be on the right path and political parties across the spectrum express support for radical action. Yet the the Guardian’s analysis shows Tory MPs have frequently voted down short-term practical measures to reduce emissions, for example through home heating efficiency or renewable energy subsidies, while lending their support to fracking and airport expansion. The Conservatives have the worst record of any party, with an average score of 17%. Despite Labour’s relatively high score of 86%, the party’s record was more mixed when it was in power in 2008-10. A year after pushing through the landmark Climate Change Act, Gordon Brown’s government voted against the 10:10 climate campaign and blocked a bill that would have made airport expansion more difficult. The Conservatives, who were then in opposition, supported both measures because their leader David Cameron wanted to create an image of a greener party. Yet after winning in 2010, his party – then in coalition with the Liberal Democrats – rolled back ambitious climate policies. The Lib Dems had an average score of 59% – until they accepted a number of ex-Tory MPs. Their inclusion brought the party down to 51%. The research has thrown up anomalies. Some relatively green Conservative MPs, such as Peter Bottomley (23%), Sarah Newton (15%), Peter Aldous (23%) and James Heappey (0%), have low scores because they were only eligible for a handful of votes, and in those they stuck to the party line. Other more climate sceptical MPs – most notably Owen Paterson (42%) – scored relatively highly because he has been in the house long enough to have been part of Cameron’s green Tory rebranding. Similarly, some Labour MPs have higher scores because they have only voted in opposition, while the stalwart environmental campaigners Kerry McCarthy (86%) and Mary Creagh (78%) fell short of a perfect mark because they stuck to the party line over the 10:10 campaign and airport expansion. Ed Milliband scored 78% although, as author of the 2008 Climate Change Act, he has arguably achieved as much as any MP in promoting emissions cuts. MPs who have a strong record on the environment said privately they were glad parliamentarians were being held to account on their climate voting records, though this could never be a perfect measure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/may/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-it-will-reopen-black-sea-ports-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-27T00:13:51Z","webTitle":" Zelenskiy complains about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-it-will-reopen-black-sea-ports-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/may/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-it-will-reopen-black-sea-ports-live","fields":{"headline":" Zelenskiy complains about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia – as it happened","bodyText":"We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Kharkiv has been hit by fresh strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 injured, authorities said. “Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians,” Zelenskiy said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. “The Russian army has thrown all its forces at taking the Luhansk region,” he said in a video on Telegram. “Extremely fierce fighting is taking place on the outskirts of Severodonetsk. They are simply destroying the city, they are shelling it every day, shelling without pause.” The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. A senior Turkish official said Ankara was in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said the Sea of Azov is “forever lost to Ukraine”. Russia’s Ria news agency also quoted a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying that the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions would never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol. The Orwellian turn comes as the Kremlin continued to push forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s “war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty” and said it was “a charged moment for the world”. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces previously said they would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs. “We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) to repel Russian attacks,” Kuleba said. The US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN. Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry. Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan. “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in his latest national address. “Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives,” he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held a phone call to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the issue of global food security on Thursday. Speaking to journalists after the call, Draghi said he would continue talking to both Moscow and Kyiv to resolve the food crisis, but added that he had little optimism for ending the war. “When asked if I have seen any glimmer of hope for peace, the answer is no,” he said. Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum, according to officials. “The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum,” city official Petro Andryushchenko said. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy has provided a little more information on the recent attack on Kharkiv, which killed at least nine civilians, including a child, and injured 19. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl.” Missile strikes continues in the Sumy region, in Donbas again, he added. “Significant intensification of the occupiers’ artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south.” The US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN. The Biden administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week, the outlet reported. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometres — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia. Earlier this week, Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry. Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address. Russia has in recent weeks pummelled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials said. Another system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS. A Ukrainian official has said that Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum. The city fell to Russian forces last week following a weeks-long siege at the Azovstal steel works plant. City official Petro Andryushchenko said: “The occupiers have announced the extension of the school year to September 1. That means no holidays. The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum.” “Throughout the summer, children will have to study Russian language, literature and history as well as maths classes in Russian,” Andryushchenko added. He said the city’s Russian leadership were having trouble enlisting teachers to take on the job, with “only 53 teachers for nine schools”. He did not say how many pupils would miss their summer holidays in the city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan. The EU is discussing a sixth round of punitive measures, including an embargo on Russian oil imports. Such a move requires unanimity but Hungary opposes the idea for now on the grounds its economy would suffer too much. “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in a late night address on Thursday, noting that Russia was receiving a billion euros a day from the 27-nation bloc for energy supplies. “Of course I am grateful to those friends who are advocating new sanctions. But where do the people blocking this sixth package get their power from? Why are they allowed to hold such power?” he asked. Berlin hopes talks on the new round of sanctions will be completed soon but it will not be a topic at a leaders’ summit next week, a German official said on Wednesday. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of procrastination, weakness, various disputes or proposals to ‘pacify’ the aggressor at the expense of the victim merely means more Ukrainians being killed,” he said. On Wednesday he savaged suggestions that Kyiv make concessions to bring peace, saying the idea smacked of attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938. He also reiterated complaints that the world had so far failed to totally isolate the Russian banking system and was not providing heavy weapons quickly enough. Nine people were killed in Kharkiv Thursday, the regional governor said, and 19 were injured. Governor Oleg Sinegubov said on social media that 19 civilians were injured. Among the dead were a five month old. These, he said, are “the terrible consequences of Russian aggression”. As my colleagues Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo reported earlier: the Russian-speaking city at the border of Ukraine was pounded by artillery for first time in two weeks, just as life there was beginning to to normal. Russian troops had been pushed back over the past few weeks, but remained within arrillery range of the city. Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 injured by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, regional authorities have said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. A senior Turkish official said Ankara was in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said the Sea of Azov is “forever lost to Ukraine”. Russia’s Ria news agency also quoted a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying that the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions would never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol. The Orwellian turn comes as the Kremlin continued to push forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s “war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty” and said it was “a charged moment for the world”. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces previously said they would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs.Russia still has a weapons advantage, and Ukraine needs “more heavy weapons. Without these, we won’t be able to push them back,” he said in a Twitter q &amp; a. Léonie Chao-Fong, Guardian staff Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs. Russia still has a weapons advantage, and Ukraine needs “more heavy weapons. Without these, we won’t be able to push them back,” he said in a Twitter q &amp; a. Asked about peace talks, he said: The moment Russia requests a ceasefire will mean only one thing, that Russia is one step away from losing the war. Russia will not request a ceasefire while they are on the offensive. But when they request a ceasefire we will think twice and three times before considering. US officials are questioning Americans who travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, citing domestic security issues, reports Politico’s Besty Woodruff Swan and Christopher Miller: U.S. officials, worried about domestic security issues, have been questioning Americans at airports as they travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, according to an intelligence bulletin reviewed by POLITICO. The document shows that the U.S. government is gathering information about Americans traveling to Ukraine and is interested in their activity after they return. But critics say the focus on “violent extremist-white supremacists” echoes one of the Kremlin’s top propaganda points: that supporting Ukraine means also supporting neo-Nazis. It comes as Washington grapples with a messy challenge: dissuading Americans from fighting alongside soldiers who have received some of their training and many of their weapons from the U.S. itself. The Justice Department has not said whether it’s legal for Americans to join the Ukraine conflict. But no Americans are known to face criminal charges just for traveling to Ukraine to fight Russia, which invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. This document shows that if law enforcement officials wanted to bring charges, they’ve had plenty of opportunities. Read the full article here. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be speaking virtually tomorrow at Stanford University, according to a tweet from a current professor at the school. Michael McFaul, a professor at Stanford and a former US ambassador to Russia, tweeted about Zelenskiy’s impending talk: Here’s a story from the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer about a Russian soldier’s life as a prisoner of war: Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm. “It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian. Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea. Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory. Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians. Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities. Read the full story here. World Health Organization (WHO) member states strongly condemned Russia today for its invasion of Ukraine and attacks on healthcare sites, reports AFP. At WHO’s annual healthcare convention, the resolution condemning Russia was approved by 88 votes, with 12 votes against. A Russian counter-resolution on the health crisis in Ukraine did not get approved. The approved resolution says that it “condemns in the strongest terms” Russia’s “military aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities”. The resolution also demands Russia “immediately cease any attacks on hospitals” and other healthcare facilities. Ukrainian ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko said that the resolution and vote “sends a clear signal to the Russian Federation: stop your war against Ukraine. Stop attacks on hospitals.” “The World Health Assembly confirmed that the responsibility for the health crisis in Ukraine rests exclusively with the Russian Federation,” added Filipenko. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said today that the military situation in eastern Ukraine is much worse than people say it is, reports Reuters. During a live question and answer session on Twitter, Kuleba said that the military situation in Ukraine’s eastern part is worse than many people say. Kuleba added that Ukraine still needs heavy weaponry to effective fight Russia. Kharkiv hit by fresh strikes amid fears city is still on Russian agenda This is the latest update on the situation in Kharkiv from Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo: Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least seven people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city. “There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks. The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure. The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre. “For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said. One fascinating aspect of US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s speech on America’s China policy was the promise to use the unity caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tool in that broader global rivalry. As the AP reports, Blinken thinks the coalition of nations now helping Ukraine against Russia can be mashalled by the US into a broader group opposing Chinese influence: “While the US sees Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as the most acute and immediate threat to international stability, Blinken said the administration believes China poses a greater danger. “Blinken laid out principles for the administration to marshal its resources, friends and allies to push back on increasing Chinese assertiveness around the world. Although he made clear that the US does not seek to change China’s political system, rather it wants to offer a tested alternative. “This is not about forcing countries to choose, it’s about giving them a choice,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry said civil vessels may safely use the Azov Sea port, in the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, as it had eliminated the danger from mines. The ministry said yesterday that Russian forces had completed removing mines in the port and nearby waters. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that the western countries supplying weapons to Ukraine capable of hitting Russian territory would be “a serious step towards unacceptable escalation”, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Lavrov as saying that he hoped sane people in the west would understand this, adding: There are still a few left there. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Finland for its support during a surprise visit from the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin. Finland’s military assistance is “very valuable”, Zelenskiy wrote on Facebook after talks with Marin, adding: Weapons, sanctions policy and the unity of our partners in the issue of Ukraine’s accession to the EU – this is what can provide strength in the defence of our land. Marin visited the Ukrainian capital as well as the towns of Irpin and Bucha, where Ukraine suspects Russian troops carried out atrocities, an allegation denied by Moscow. Russia’s actions in Ukraine were a “turning point for the entire European family and the whole world”, Marin said after meetings with Zelenskiy and his prime minister. She described Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “an attempt against the principles of building a common European home”, adding: What happened, what Russia did is a turning point for the entire European family and the whole world. We see that the old arrangement has been destroyed and there is no return to the former relationship. A British man who has turned his Polish castle into a makeshift hotel for Ukrainian refugees has accused the UK government of showing “no humanity whatsoever” for not allowing a severely autistic teenager to come to live with an approved foster carer in Lancashire, Helen Pidd and Diane Taylor report. Pleas are mounting for compassion to be shown to Timothy Tymoshenko, 16, who fled the war in Ukraine without his parents. He is living with his 17-year-old brother, Yurii, in what was once a private palace for the prince-bishop of Wrocław in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border. Jim Parton, a former stockbroker and writer from London, lives there with his Polish wife, Anna, and their six children, aged seven to 17. When the Russian invasion began in February, they decided to turn what is usually a guest house and wedding venue into an open house for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary abroad. They are currently hosting 17 people in the sprawling 700-year-old palace, after four left for Canada on Monday. Among those remaining is Timothy, who is severely autistic, non-verbal and needs strong prescription medication to control his changing moods. Experienced children’s carers in Lancashire have been to visit the boys in Poland and are willing to take the brothers in, but are growing increasingly frustrated that the UK government hasn’t yet granted them visas to enter the country. Julie Elliot, 61, and her husband, Roger, 66, already have 14 children together – four biological and 10 adopted. Both worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers to their adopted family, and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children. Their adopted children, aged between nine and 40, all have disabilities and eight of them still live at the couple’s home in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire. They and Parton are pleading with the Home Office to let Timothy come to the UK along with his brother. They do not qualify for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as unaccompanied children under 18. The issue is the subject of a high court challenge and dozens of UK foster carers are anxiously waiting to see if approval is granted for the children they hope to care for to be brought to the UK. At least seven civilians have been killed and 17 wounded during Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, according to local authorities. Earlier it was reported that five people had died and 10 were injured, including one child, as a result of today’s shelling in Ukraine’s second-largest city. The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Synehubov, reported heavy fighting to the north and north-east of the city. He said: The enemy is again insidiously hitting the civilian population, terrorising them. The claims have not been independently verified. It’s almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. At least eight civilians were killed and 17 injured, including a child, by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, regional authorities have said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports.

Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying.

Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, in a phone call earlier this afternoon. In a statement after the call, Rome said the pair discussed the situation in Ukraine, the food crisis and its impact on poor countries. No further details of the call were given. In the Kremlin’s readout of the call, it said Putin told Draghi that Russia was ready to significantly contribute to solving the international food crisis but only if the west lifts sanctions. The Russian leader also said Moscow was ready to continue uninterrupted gas supplies to Italy, the Kremlin said. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. In a speech on the Biden administration’s policy towards China at George Washington University, Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s war on Ukraine. Blinken said: Even while Russia was clearly mobilising to invade Ukraine, President Xi and President Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was, and I quote, ‘without limits’. He emphasised that the US did not want another cold war and did not support Taiwanese independence. But he said: Beijing’s defence of President Putin’s war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home. This is a charged moment for the world. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine, Belarus’s state-owned news agency Belta reports. Lukashenko was quoted by Belta as saying: Regretfully, a new direction has opened, a new front as they say, and we cannot neglect it. Earlier this month, the Belarusian armed forces said it would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Minsk has complained about Nato allies amassing soldiers near its borders - Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are all members of the alliance - and is increasing the amount and intensity of its own military exercises in response. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Videos published by the Russian ministry of emergency situations showed the vans, which it called “mobile information complexes”, playing state TV news segments and political chatshows where pundits support the invasion to locals in the ruined city that still lacks electricity and running water. The Orwellian turn comes as much of Mariupol was destroyed in an artillery bombardment that left thousands dead. One of the vans was deployed near the ruins of the Mariupol drama theatre, where hundreds were killed in an airstrike in March. Several of the trucks now patrol the city, mainly playing Russian television news segments. “The people of Mariupol have been held in a virtual informational vacuum for three months due to the lack of electricity,” wrote the emergencies ministry in a statement. The mobile screens have reportedly been deployed to places where Mariupol residents are receiving humanitarian aid, Russian documents, and at points in the city where drinking water is available. “The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”. “The truth and the propaganda,” wrote Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, posting a video of the trucks superimposed over images of the ruins of the city. This is “the Russian world”, he added. The UK government introduced legislation on Thursday to help councils, NHS trusts and other public bodies exit contracts with Gazprom and other Russian companies, Alex Lawson and Pamela Duncan report. Councils have been keen to withdraw from contracts amid concerns they were helping to fund Vladimir Putin’s regime. They had been prohibited from taking “non-commercial considerations” into account when procuring or terminating contracts, and they have a statutory duty to find the cheapest deal on behalf of the taxpayer. Many councils had been forced to select Gazprom as a supplier because it offered the greatest value for money. They paid £29m to Gazprom from 2016 to 2021, data firm Tussell has said. In March the Cabinet Office asked central government to review all contracts with Russia and Belarus-linked firms and to consider terminating those contracts. This process has been extended to local councils. Councils including Merton and Telford and Wrekin have said they are keen to cut ties with Russia. A government source said: “Local authorities are not obliged to terminate contracts, but our message is clear: Putin’s barbaric regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.” Michael Gove will write to all councils to make them aware of the changes. The government has said any costs incurred from exiting contracts will have to be covered by existing budgets. The west is attempting to choke off the Russian economy to damage Putin’s war coffers and fuel anti-war sentiment among the Russian public. Natalia Popova, adviser to the head of the Kharkiv regional council, has posted an updated set of casualty figures for the shelling of Kharkiv today. She said on Facebook: “Ten wounded. Among the wounded, one child. Five people died.” She urged people to go to or to remain in shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. Peter Beaumont has this latest report of the overall situation in the war on Ukraine: Ukrainians in the eastern Donbas region are burying dead civilians in mass graves in the face of a concerted assault by Russia, which is reportedly holding about 8,000 prisoners of war in the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk. Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken by Russian forces, Ukraine’s general staff reported that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the region remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago. Haidai added that police in Lysychansk were burying the bodies of civilians in mass graves, with about 150 people having been buried in such a grave in one district. If confirmed, the continuing Russian advances in Lyman, which has been contested for a month, would make it easier for Russian forces to isolate the key city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under relentless shelling for days. According to accounts posted on social media, Lyman’s Ukrainian defenders had pulled back to the southern outskirts, although fighting was continuing, in particular around the railway sidings in the town. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report here: Ukrainians burying civilians in mass graves as Russia advances A senior Ukrainian official has conceded that Russia at present has the upper hand in fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. Gen Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing: Russia has the advantage, but we are doing everything we can. He added that Russia has been spotted moving Iskander missile systems to Belarus’s western Brest region. This raised the possibility of new missile strikes on west Ukraine, Gromov said. St Petersburg’s anti-war protesters want to send a message to those “who are still silent”. As the women protest against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, reactions are varied from passersby: some stop to whisper their gratitude, and others castigate them as traitors. At least four civilians were killed and several injured by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, according to the regional governor. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synyehubov urged residents of the city to go to shelters. Turkey is in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus for grain exports from Ukraine, according to a senior Turkish official. The official, requesting anonymity because the talks were confidential, told Reuters: Turkey is negotiating with both Russia and Ukraine for the export of grains from Ukraine. With a corridor to be opened from Turkey, there was a demand for this grain to reach their targeted markets. Negotiations are still ongoing. Two other sources confirmed that Turkey was in talks to help the grains be shipped out of Ukraine. Although a Nato member, Turkey was seen as more “neutral” than other western alliance members, one person said. A senior diplomat said yesterday: Turkey is ready to contribute to a kind of monitoring of these exports from Odesa through the Black Sea because Turkey traditionally is very strong in the Black Sea and they are ready to help. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. Speaking during a visit to Bosnia Herzegovina, Truss was asked whether she supported lifting sanctions in exchange for grain exports from Ukraine. Truss replied: It is completely appalling that Putin is trying to hold the world to ransom. He is essentially weaponising hunger and lack of food amongst the poorest people around the world. We simply cannot allow this to happen. Putin needs to remove the blockade on Ukrainian grain. She added: What we cannot have is any lifting of sanctions, any appeasement, which will simply make Putin stronger in the longer term. Journalists from western countries will be expelled from Russia if YouTube blocks access to Moscow’s foreign ministry’s briefings, the ministry said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, who holds a weekly briefing, said the ministry had warned YouTube against blocking her content. Zakharova was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: We just came and told them: ‘You block another briefing, one journalist or American media outlet goes home. Another briefing is blocked and we will name a specific journalist or specific media outlet that will go home.’ She added that Moscow was working on measures against English-language media in response to what it considered “unfriendly actions” by foreign governments towards Russian news outlets. She did not provide further details. Zakharova’s comments came after Russian lawmakers approved a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut foreign media bureaus if a western country has been “unfriendly” to Russian media. The measure is meant to retaliate for the closure of some Russian state news outlets in the west. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been speaking during his regular briefing where he rejected claims that Russia had blocked grain exports from Ukraine. Instead, Peskov accused the west of creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. Peskov told reporters: We categorically do not accept these accusations. On the contrary, we blame Western countries for taking actions that have led to this. Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea have been blocked since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, leaving more than 20m tons of grain stuck in silos in the country. Yesterday, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said the Kremlin would allow ships carrying food to leave Ukrainian ports in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from the Belgorod region in Russia. The shelling destroyed an educational establishment in the town of Derhachi, the prosecutors said. Bobikin and Ivanov, described as an artillery driver and a gunner, were captured after crossing the border and continuing the shelling, the prosecutor general’s office said. At the trial in the Kotelevska district court in central Ukraine, Bobikin told the court: I am completely guilty of the crimes of which I am accused. We fired at Ukraine from Russia. Ivanov asked not to be handed the maximum jail term, telling the court: I repent and ask for a reduction in the sentence. State prosecutors asked for the pair to be jailed for 12 years for violating the laws of war. A defence lawyer asked for leniency, arguing that two soldiers had been following orders and repented. The verdict is expected on 31 May. Hello, it is Léonie Chao-Fong here in London taking over from Martin Belam with all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20m tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has said they cannot yet be 100% sure they have flushed every last Ukrainian fighter out of the Azovstal steel plant. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said: “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine.” He is reported to have said: “Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation.” Russia’s ministry of defence claims that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed, and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled. Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion. Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war. Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has said fighting is most intense in the Izyum region. He claimed: “The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk.” Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he believes Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. He said everyone in the world understands it is not “a special operation”, but that it is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a thunderbolt, and that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms. British foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to urge Britain’s allies to remain strong in support of Ukraine and not to appease Putin, in a speech later today. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong. My colleague Graeme Wearden is in Davos, where the German chancellor Olaf Scholz is speaking: Olaf Scholz has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February was a thunderbolt, and that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms. A nuclear power is acting as if it has the right to redraw borders, he said. This is imperialism, threatening to to take us back to a time when war was a common instrument of politics. We cannot allow Putin to win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it, Scholz said. The prospect of Russia capturing all of Ukraine seems less likely than at the start of the war, Germany’s chancellor says, thanks to the Ukrainian forces and support from international community. Finland and Sweden are looking to join Nato, and we would welcome them with open arms, Scholz says. He says Germany is providing heavy weapons to Ukraine, and Scholz believes that Putin will only seriously negotiate peace when he believes he cannot break Ukraine’s defences. Russia must not be allowed to dictate the peace terms, Scholz said. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted a situation update to Telegram. He states: On 25 May the Russians lead a powerful and long-lasting artillery attack on Lysychansk. They attempted to storm our defence near Ustynivka at the same time destroying this village and Lysychansk nearby by artillery As a result, two died in Ustynivka and one in Lysychansk. A shell hit the humanitarian aid centre, and a volunteer car that delivered food to Luhansk region was damaged. Eleven high-rises, the building of ‘Impulse’ in Sievierodonetsk, eight high-rises and private houses, a house of culture and the Administration Services Centre in Lysychansk, four houses in Privillya, two in Novodruzhesk and Hirske each were destroyed. Now the enemy is trying to gain a foothold near Sievierodonetsk. On 25 May overall, 10 Russian attacks were repelled, four tanks, two artillery systems, an armoured personnel carrier, a motor vehicle and one unit of special equipment were destroyed. Air defence units shot down five UAVs ‘Orlan-10’. The claims have not been independently verified. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv on the anarchists joining Ukraine’s struggle against Russia: In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight. It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their own survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.” He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine. “His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grass-roots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.” Read more of Isobel Koshiw’s report from Kyiv: ‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’ – anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort Russia’s military have issued their operational briefing for the day. Among the claims – which have not been independently verified – are: “High-precision air-based missiles hit 48 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine.” “In the area of the settlement of Dneprovskoe, Mykolaiv region, the Ukrainian center of electronic intelligence was destroyed, including 11 military personnel of the combat crew, as well as 15 foreign specialists who arrived with the protection of engineering and operational staff.” “Russian air defence systems shot down one Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter over the village of Gusarovka, Kharkiv region. Also, a military transport aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force, which was delivering ammunition and weapons, was shot down in the air in the Kremidovka region of the Odessa region.” The Russians also claim that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed, and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled. The Russian ministry of defence have also published two videos this morning. One of which claims to show a series of Ukrainian defence trenches which had been seized by Russian forces. The other shows the launching of an OTRK “Iskander” missile, which Russia claims can hit targets up to 500km away and is “impossible” to detect. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has issued an update on his region on Telegram. He reported: A 62-year-old man was injured in the shelling in the Pyatihatok district of Kharkiv last night. Balakliya was shelled: ten people, including a nine-year-old child, were injured. Two people died: men aged 64 and 82. Only a nine-year-old girl was taken from Balaklia to Kharkiv, she is in stable serious condition. Other patients were hospitalised in Kupyansk CDH. Russian occupiers fired on Zircons, burned houses, one victim. Also one victim of shelling of Chuguiv district. This morning Zolochiv community and Slatine were fired upon again, Dergachiv community - two wounded. He went on to say: Our armed forces of Ukraine are fighting intensively against the Russian occupiers. The hottest in the Izyum region. The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has given an interview to Russia’s RIA Novosti in which he has said he cannot be certain that all Ukrainian forces have been expelled from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. They quote him saying: No, it’s impossible. They could hide physically, they could be lost somewhere. For now, we thoroughly check every nook and cranny of Azovstal, and there the territory is quite serious. I will not say that they are 100% there, or 100% have already been cleared. After our units check everything, clear mines, after they clear all the rubble that is there, after that we can say … there is absolutely no one left. Graeme Wearden is in Davos, where Kyiv’s mayor is speaking: Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, begins his briefing by saying that Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. It is clear that it is not a special military operation, as Russia claims, but war, one of the biggest since the second world war, he says. Thousands of people have died, including a lot of children, Klitschko says, with a huge battle raging in the East of Ukraine. It is no secret that Russia’s priority is to occupy the whole country, and their main target is still the capital of Ukraine, the heart of the country, the former heavyweight champion says. He says the whole world has seen the evidence from satellite cities such as Bucha. Everyone understands, it’s not a special operation.. it is the genocide of the Ukranian people, Klitschko says, with children, women, and old people killed. And he explains the human suffering, saying it is difficult to understand how people can lose their home in a moment - or suddenly lose friends, relatives, or parents. Dr Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), believes the reconstruction of cities bombed in the invasion can be an example to the rest of Europe. Speaking yesterday at a panel session in Davos organised by the Arctic Basecamp group of climate scientists, Dr Krakovska said: We have a big disaster in our country, we have so many people killed, our cities destroyed. But these destroyed cities are our opportunity, to rebuild them in a climate-resilient way. To do this we will need the support of all the international community, financial support and technology support as well. So we are looking forward to having Ukraine as a role model for Europe. Dr Krakovska received a medal from Ukraine’s Volodymyr president Zelenskiy last year for her work on rising global temperatures, including visiting the Antarctic to monitor the impact of climate change there. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has posted a status update for the day. He said that there was one air alert overnight, but there were no strikes reported. He also said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday. The impact of the war in Ukraine has been a strong theme running through the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this week. Today, in about half-an-hour, Vitaliy Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, will be speaking about how to rebuild the Ukrainian capital after the war, and what aid will be needed. My colleague Graeme Wearden is there, and he will be covering that live on our business blog. I’ll bring you the top lines here. The deputy prime minister of the Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine” according to reports from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. They quote him saying: The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine. Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation The agency also quotes Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying the same – that Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia annexed Crimea after invading in 2014. Ukraine has repeatedly said that it will not enter any peace deal that does not restore its borders. Vladimir Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev has said that Russia will not accept any settlement that does not recognise Crimea as Russian territory. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by Tass news agency as saying on Thursday, according to Reuters. “There are a lot of prisoners. Of course, there are more of them on the territory of Donetsk People’s Republic, but we also have enough, and now the total number is somewhere in the region of 8,000. That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik said. This is Martin Belam taking over from my colleagues in Australia. I can be reached at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war. It notes that Russia’s elite airborne forces – the VDV – have been heavily involved in several notable tactical failures since the start of Russia’s invasion such as the failure to capture Hostomel airfield near Kyiv and the recent “failed and costly crossings of the Siverskyi Donets river”. The MoD analysts say that the VDV “has been employed on missions better suited to heavier armoured infantry and has sustained heavy casualties during the campaign. Its mixed performance likely reflects a strategic mismanagement of this capability and Russia’s failure to secure air superiority”. It concludes that the misemployment of the VDV in Ukraine shows how Vladimir utin’s huge investment in his armed forces in recent years has resulted in “an unbalanced overall force”. Our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has more on the speech British foreign secretary Liz Truss plans to make in Bosnia on Thursday. She is expected to urge Britain’s allies to remain strong in support of Ukraine and not to appease Vladimir Putin. It comes as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for more weapons from the west to stave off Russia’s onslaught in the Donbas region. Here’s Patrick’s dispatch: Amidst growing discussion about an early diplomatic settlement to the war in Ukraine involving a loss of territory to Russia, Truss will say the West must not take their feet off the accelerator or else a more prolonged and bloody conflict will ensue. In a visit to Bosnia Herzegovina she will insist “we must all learn the lesson of history” in standing up to Putin. She makes no criticism of a specific country, but it is known there is growing frustration amongst countries that take the hardest line in support of Ukraine that Germany and Hungary are not doing more to back Ukraine either by supplying heavy weapons or allowing an EU wide embargo on Russian oil imports to be started. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday warned of a fatigue in Europe with the war, and growing public concern about rising food and energy prices. Truss in a speech to Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces at Sarajevo’s Army Hall, will say: “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength. We must not allow a prolonged and increasingly painful conflict to develop in Ukraine. We must be relentless in ensuring Ukraine prevails through military aid and sanctions. We can’t take our foot off the accelerator now.” Britain has been one the countries leading in support for Ukraine, and Truss within the British cabinet has been one of the most uncompromising On Friday she will travel to Prague for talks with Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský where she will praise the Czechs for supplying tanks to Ukraine. The Czechs are due to be compensated by Germany supplying tanks to replace those sent to Ukraine On Tuesday the Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday accused the German government of breaking its word on an agreement to supply Warsaw with new tanks as compensation for Polish deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last month introduced the so-called “Ringtausch,” a swap scheme under which eastern NATO partners would supply the Ukrainian army with Soviet-era tanks like the T-72 in exchange for modern western tanks from German manufacturers, such as the Leopard. Germany is due to deliver 14 Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks and one Leopard tank recovery vehicle to Prague under the swap scheme. A Russian soldier who was held as a prisoner of war in Ukraine for 45 days before being allowed to return home has told about the toll being in captivity has taken on his mind and body. Speaking to Pjotr Sauer, our correspondent in Russia, the soldier, from Siberia, said he received very little military training and was shocked when he was told his unit was going into Ukraine. When he was captured he said he was not physically harmed but suffered mental torment from his Ukrainian captors. “We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.” The every-day boredom was the hardest thing. “If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television. “Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity. Read Pjotr’s full report here: Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions, the Interfax news agency cited Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. More than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos in the country, raising concerns about famine in countries dependent on the supplies. Western powers have been discussing the idea of setting up “safe corridors” for grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, although these would need Russian consent. “We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,” Rudenko was quoted as saying. “And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage, which it does every day.” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say, noting how appeasement of Russian president Vladimir Putin after his wars in Georgia and Crimea has not worked. Hello. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up or dropping in to catch up on what’s been happening, here are some of the latest developments: Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine. Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. He criticised a New York Times editorial that suggested Ukraine must compromise by giving up territory in exchange for peace. he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s plan to simplify the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied regions violates international law. The ministry’s statement came after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree simplifying the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia region. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.” A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/jul/23/national-security-labor-coalition-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-23T08:22:36Z","webTitle":"Angus Taylor says Labor's questions about land he part-owns are 'grubby smear' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/23/national-security-labor-coalition-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/23/national-security-labor-coalition-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Angus Taylor says Labor's questions about land he part-owns are 'grubby smear' – as it happened","bodyText":"On that note, we are going to wrap up Politics Live for the day. A lot of coffee has been consumed. Along with a lot of sugar. I can hear colours. We’ll be back bright and early tomorrow, when no doubt we will be once again wondering ‘WhOSe SiDE aRe YOu oN’ will come up, when the ensuring integrity (unions are bad) bill comes into the House, along with what ever is left over from Peter Dutton’s latest national security palooza – which includes the medevac repeal (which is in committee, but will pass through the house) We live in truly blessed times. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for everything today, as well as all of those behind the scenes who keep this little blog that could ticking along. But as always, the biggest thank you goes to you, for following along with us. We’ll be back at sparrow’s tomorrow. In the meantime – take care of you. Labor’s amendments on the temporary exclusion bill have been officially defeated – Peter Dutton has just called for the third reading and the bill will be off to the Senate. A totally normal reaction. Much adulation. Many congrats It’s great that the 2019 parliament lets me throw back to 2013 memes The House is going through the pretence that Labor’s amendments are going to change anything (the government has already said no, and Labor has already said it will vote for it anyway). If you want to know what a temporary exclusion order is about and why Labor has some concerns about the legislation (it is now going to vote for) Paul Karp has done up an explainer for you. All of these speeches are for when there is a challenge or failure of the legislation and Labor can say “told you so”. Police have committed a series of illegal metadata searches, including Western Australian police obtaining invalid warrants targeting journalists and ACT police accessing data 116 times without proper authorisation. The breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act are revealed in a Commonwealth Ombudsman report for the period July 2016 to June 2017, tabled in parliament by the government on Monday. In addition to one instance of the Australian federal police accessing a journalist’s data without a warrant reported in 2017, the ombudsman discovered two instances where the WA police applied for – and obtained – a journalist information warrant from a person not authorised to provide it. “This occurred due to a lack of awareness by WA police regarding to whom an application for a journalist information warrant could be made,” the report said. “In response to this issue, WA police took steps to quarantine all information obtained under the invalid warrants.” The report also revealed that between 13 and 26 October 2015 “all authorisations within ACT policing were made by an officer not authorised” by the relevant section of the law. “This issue affected 116 authorisations during the period,” it said. “This issue also affected a large number of authorisations dating back to March 2015, which precede the commencement of our office’s oversight on 13 October 2015.” Anyone wanting some context for Greg Hunt’s victory yell - you might remember that Julia Banks left the seat of Chisholm (which Gladys Liu won) to challenge him in Flinders. So it was less about Liu and more about hyping himself up. That was some Kanye level love right there. Some of how Mike Bowers saw the day Peter Dutton is now on his feet, confirming the government will not be accepting Labor’s amendment to the temporary exclusion order. Labor has already confirmed it will vote for the bill, even if the government rejects its amendments. Greg Hunt just held up Gladys Liu’s hands like a boxing champion and yelled “YEAH” in the chamber. This is an actual thing which just happened. Meanwhile The first speeches continue – Gladys Liu is delivering hers now. The government has just released a review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal conducted by former high court justice Ian Callinan. The structure of the AAT may sound a bit nerdy, but it is super important because the AAT reviews government actions including refugee cases and robo-debt decisions. The report paints a picture of a massive backlog of cases - particularly in the migration division - and members without legal training struggling to write decisions. Throughout the last term of parliament, Labor accused the Coalition of stacking the tribunal with its mates. The review recommended: Appointment of no fewer than 15 to 30 members to the migration and refugee division All further appointments, re-appointments or renewals of appointment to the membership of the AAT should be of lawyers, admitted or qualified for admission ... and on the basis of merit The practice of seeking advice from staff by members should be restricted to 12 requests for the provision of relevant material from the library. Any request by a member, for the review of or advice on the drafting of decisions is not acceptable. Appointment of counsel assisting the migration and refugee division “as an advocate, as required, in the public interest”. “The presence in different and complex cases of such a counsel would relieve the member of the onerous duties that the members now have and assist unrepresented applicants.” Abolish the second tier of review by the general division of the social security and child support division Extend the power to make oral decisions to decisions to vary or set aside a Centrelink decision Callinan also suggested consideration of “a new information rule conferring a wide discretion upon the AAT to receive or refuse evidence not before the original decision-maker”. That was because of evidence from several members of the migration and refugee division “that during delays in hearings not a small number of applicants contrived situations to support a favourable decision, or ground for appeal to the courts”. The attorney general, Christian Porter, acknowledged that “since amalgamation, the tribunal’s workload has increased significantly, particularly in the migration and refugee division”. He said: “The government is carefully considering the recommendations from Mr Callinan’s report and is committed to improving the efficiency of the tribunal and maintaining the integrity of Australia’s migration policy.” Anyone who caught Ed Husic on Sky and wondered who he was talking about when he said this: It was in relation to this And the terms of reference for that inquiry are below: That the following matters be referred to the environment and communications references committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day of December 2019: a) disclosure and public reporting of sensitive and classified information, including the appropriate regime for warrants regarding journalists and media organisations and adequacy of existing legislation; b) the whistleblower protection regime and protections for public sector employees; c) the adequacy of referral practices of the Australian government in relation to leaks of sensitive and classified information; d) appropriate culture, practice and leadership for government and senior public employees; e) mechanisms to ensure that the Australian federal police have sufficient independence to effectively and impartially carry out their investigatory and law enforcement responsibilities in relation to politically sensitive matters; and f) any related matters. A Senate committee will look at press freedom. From Sarah Hanson-Young (who will chair it): This week’s arrest of four French journalists highlights how badly we need to rethink press freedom in Australia. Press and whistleblower protections have been steadily eroded and the government just wants to sweep this under the carpet. Today the Senate voted for an inquiry into press freedom and whistleblower protection showing that there are some in our parliament who care about a frank and fearless media. The raids on the ABC and a News Corp journalist sent chills through the country. The erosions of freedoms in Australia must be wound back. The ability of citizens to speak truth to power must be maintained and that is why whistleblowers must be protected and journalists allowed to do their job. This inquiry will get to the bottom of what has gone on and ensure a future for a free press in Australia.” Anyone looking for the stories Anne Davies and Lisa Cox wrote on Angus Taylor can find them here and here. PHRASING boom! Following question time, Mark Butler sent out this press release: Australians deserve to know exactly where the Morrison government would build nuclear power plants under the intensifying Coalition campaign for Australia to develop a nuclear power industry. In question time today energy minister Angus Taylor said he had an “open mind” on the use of nuclear energy. Industry minister Karen Andrews and several other MPs have made similar comments, while prime minister Scott Morrison has said nuclear power is “not not’’ on his agenda and Queensland MPs Keith Pitt and James McGrath have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the issue. Earlier this week maverick National Barnaby Joyce ramped up the pressure for change by proposing authorities could get around public concerns about safety of nuclear energy by giving people free power if they could see a nuclear reactor from their home. Nuclear energy is banned in Australia. But with so many Coalition MPs now advocating its use, Australians deserve to know where the government is headed on energy policy. In particular, it should explain where nuclear power plants might be built, particularly since these facilities need to be sited near large bodies of water. If Mr Morrison is open to using nuclear energy, would he be prepared to have a nuclear power plant built in the Sutherland shire, in his own electorate? Given her position, Ms Andrews should say whether she would welcome a nuclear power plant in her community on the Gold Coast. With Mr Pitt and senator McGrath advocating a parliamentary inquiry, they should say whether they would support construction of nuclear power plants in Queensland coastal towns like Townsville, Rockhampton, Gladstone and the Sunshine Coast. The Coalition should also say whether they believe coastal centres in New South Wales, such Coffs Harbour, Wollongong and Nowra, or Western Australian cities including Perth, Bunbury and Geraldton would make good sites for reactors. The Coalition is struggling for an answer to six years of failure on energy policy. If it sees nuclear power as that answer, it should be more open with Australians about its intentions. Research by the parliamentary library has confirmed there are literally dozens of sites around the nation where nuclear power plants could be constructed. Just this week the Australian Nuclear Association called for the construction of 20 nuclear energy plants and nominated potential sites including the Latrobe Valley, Albury and Whyalla. Scott Morrison leaves the chamber with Angus Taylor, as Anthony Albanese stands on indulgence to congratulate Amanda Rishworth on the birth of her son, Oscar. Christian Porter seconds the congratulations from the government and compliments the “beautiful name”. Anne Aly wants to note that she has been misrepresented – but it is not time for that yet. “Don’t forget me,” Aly says. Tony Smith promises that he won’t. Scott Morrison calls time on question time, adding: “And I would invite the opposition to ask me a question tomorrow. You didn’t do that today. Maybe tomorrow” Karen Andrews Karens her dixer again: We have committed to an additional $5m to promote globally the Australian-made logo because we want everyone across the world, when they see that green and gold label, to go, how good is Australia?” While Karen Andrews takes the next dixer, Scott Morrison caucuses with Michael McCormack, Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg and the cameras go off madly, capturing it. David Littleproud finds this hilarious. To be fair, question time has a very low bar for what is funny. It is back to Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: “Why won’t the minister tell the House whether or not a compliance officer was present at the meeting?” Taylor: At the time, 2017, when I was in a previous role, I had no idea who was coming to that meeting, I didn’t appoint, I didn’t ask those people to come to a meeting. My understanding that there was a compliance officer there ... It is very clear, Mr Speaker, that on that day I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of the revised listing. This is a big deal for farmers, something that those opposite wouldn’t understand. It affects the small businesses and farms in my electorate and all of those businesses that depend on them. And it is my job as a local member to make sure they get a fair deal. As I said in the previous answer, an independent review by Wendy Crag identified there was serious issues and I am pleased now that the government is acting on, which will ensure that farmers are better able to work with the EPBC act and hopefully will reduce red tape for farmers who are the greatest custodians of our environment.” I have just been told that the government didn’t miss a question. It was waiting for the crossbench to jump, and Andrew Wilkie didn’t. So I take back my Bert van Manen sass. He remains out of the principal’s office. Andrew Wilkie gets the crossbench question and it is to Greg Hunt: “Hobart city council yesterday voted in support of pill testing at major events and festivals. Now we know pill testing saves lives and health experts agree a harmonisation approach is the only sensible response to illicit drug use. “Yet the Tasmanian government is clinging to an ideological opposition to harm minimisation and pill testing in particular and refuses to back the council’s position. “Minister, ... government like Tasmania’s have shown they simply don’t understand the issue. So will you as health minister put the issue of pill testing on the Coag health council?” Hunt: The answer is no. Yesterday I respectfully disagreed on the proposition. Today I will respectfully but categorically disagree with the member. What he has proposed is, I believe, a dangerous and unfounded course of action. Let me say this, whether it is tested or not, MDMA, ice, certain opioids can be deadly in their purest form. These are drugs which are illegal for a reason. They are drugs because they can kill. They are drugs because the nature of the response may not be known in an individual case, at the very moment that this parliament, that this government and the entire nation is seeking to deal with some of the challenges of amphetamines and of opioids, the idea that we would be condoning, encouraging and supporting the expansion of their consumption is, to mind mind, utterly unthinkable, and so this is not a position which the Australian government will be adopted. It is an position the Australian government will be opposing ... Even if it makes it clear that it is a pure form of MDMA, or a pure form of ice, or a pure form of fentanyl, that is not going to save a person. They may take an overdose or even if they take what they believe is an appropriate dose, that can be enough to take their lives. That is why these drugs are dangerous, that is why these drugs are illicit and that is why we will not be adopting the approach which the member I believe foolishly and dangerously has advocated.” Lucky alcohol has never killed anyone. Oh, wait ... Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to his previous answer. When seeking the assistance of the treasurer to arrange a meeting with departmental officials about critically endangered grasslands in the Monaro region, did he disclose his personal interest in the matter? Taylor: Mr Speaker, I have always disclosed my personal interest, any interest, that may have an impact on my role. I have been clear about that, but is my job and I do it all the time. Now as I said, at this meeting the member opposite refers to, I received a briefing from a departmental official, some technical aspects of the revised listing, but I would point out that an independent review since then by Wendy Craig released only about one month ago found that there have been major deficiencies in how the act is understood and how in particular farmers are dealt with. And I am pleased that this review specifically identified the very issues that I have previously raised and that were raised in this meeting, Mr Speaker, and that is because I will always act in the interest of farmers. Perhaps those opposite could learn a little bit from that.” For the second day in a row, a government MP forgets to jump when it is their question and Terri Butler gets a second go. Scott Morrison’s head swivels to the backbench so fast he would have put Jim Carrey in his prime to shame. Someone from the government says “no” and Tony Smith tells them there is no “no” and that he looked to the government side, and then to Labor and “only one person jumped”. Bert van Manen, as the chief government whip, can probably expect a call to the principal’s office. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister’s previous answer and I asked again was the compliance officer present at the meeting? Taylor: I have dealt with this in the previous question, I have dealt with this in the previous question. This was not a discussion, this was not a discussion about a compliance action. It was a discussion, it was a discussion – let’s be clear, let’s be clear – the discussion was about the impact of a revised listing on farmers in my electorate. And there were two affected electorates, Mr Speaker, my electorate and my neighbour’s electorate. I care about the farmers in my electorate. I will always act in the interest because that is my job.” Taylor: Now, Mr Speaker, it is simply not enough to have power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. We need it 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. And that is why we sharply focused on keeping our existing coal and gas generation in the market, running at full tilt. But there are alternative approaches.” “What about Barnaby’s proposal,” Labor yells. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: Was the compliance officer from the department of the environment present at the meeting referred to in his previous answer with departmental officials about the listing of critically endangered grasslands in the Monaro region affecting land he part owned?” Taylor: Thank you for the question but look this is a grubby smear from those opposite, one of many that have been made and were made during the election campaign and I have been very clear on this. This was not a discussion about compliance action; it was a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC act! And the secretary of the department has made very clear, and I quote, ‘I can be very clear that minister Taylor has never raised the issue.’ This is the point. And I make no apology, Mr Speaker, I make no apology for acting in the interests of the farmers in my electorate and it is about time those opposite, it is about time those opposite stood up for the farmers in their electorates.” Labor points out that Monaro is not his electorate. Tony Burke gets up to ask a point of order, but Taylor has finished his answer. He also gets the next dixer, which makes the Labor benches laugh. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: “In the meeting he referred to in his official answer with members of the department, did he disclose his ... [interest] or in compliance investigation into land clearing in that region?” Taylor: “I have always disclosed my interests, I have always disclosed my interests, and I have been clear about those. “In 2017 before I was the minister in this role, as I answered in the previous question, I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the act and the reason is that those changes impacted the farmers in my electorate. “I care about the farmers in my electorate. I care about the farmers in my electorate. I wanted to see the drought fund go through yesterday, despite, despite the protestations from those opposite. “Unlike the member for Eden Monaro who takes no interest in the farmers in his electorate! “The department for environment has confirmed the briefing did not discuss compliance action. They have confirmed that when raised in Senate estimates in April 2019 the secretary of the department of the environment said: ‘I could be very clear that Mr Taylor has never raised an issue with me.’ ” For someone who doesn’t talk about “on water matters”, Peter Dutton certainly likes talking about on-water matters. When it suits. There have been 34 attempted boat arrivals since the Coalition came to power. Also, it is not illegal to seek asylum. Peter Dutton is now explaining how the most recent boat arrival attempt is Labor’s fault. Six years after Labor was last in government. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister by the appointment to environment and energy including all matters to the department made on 29 May. Can the minister confirm the company in which he has an interest is now being investigated by his own department in relation to the alleged illegal land clearing of critically endangered grasslands? Taylor: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you for the question. I have been very clear about this in public. I have no association and I have remained unlinked from the company. In 2017 I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the act and I make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving a briefing on policies that seriously impact farmers in my electorate because I care about farmers in my electorate. I care about farmers in my electorate and ... what the people expect from me as their local member, the most remarkable fact is that other affected members such as the member for Eden Monaro did not do the same. I will always stand up for the people of my electorate. I will do the right thing by them at every point in time.” Christian Porter is continuing the JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON segment that Peter Dutton started. He mentions something Anne Aly said during the debate, about it not being “impactful” legislation. It was a bit more nuanced than that, but Tony Smith tells Aly that if she wants to dispute it, there are other ways to do it. Porter continues. “Oh, my God, read a book,” Aly says, which is an excellent Archer reference, whether she knows it or not. Pat Conroy to ... ANGUS TAYLOR ***Ding-ding-ding*** “Is the government working on a policy proposed by the member for New England where, and I quote, ‘If you can see the nuclear reactor from your house, your power is for free. If you are within 50km of a reactor, you get the power for half price.” The response from a potential-future-Liberal-prime-minister: “The answer to that is no.” It’s time for Peter Dutton’s JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU segment. VERY SAFE. As long as you pass all his legislation. This has been JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON edition. Justine Elliott to Angus Taylor: Does he rule out a nuclear power station being built in northern New South Wales, or on the Gold Coast? Taylor: I am delighted to receive questions from those of us who are here today because during the election campaign they steadfastly refused to answer questions about their real plan, which was to establish a carbon tax, double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas for all Australians. That is what they intended to do and that is why the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Port Adelaide’s steadfastly refused to answer questions throughout the campaign ... The government’s priority is on getting energy prices down for all Australians, hard-working households and small businesses while we keep the lights on and we have steadfastly said that we will focus on cuts ...” Tony Smith tells him his preamble is over. Taylor: We’re not focused on the fuel source, we are focused on the outcome and we currently have a moratorium on nuclear power generation in Australia, and the government has no plans to change that. Now we always approach these things with an open mind, but we do not have ... We do not have a plan to change the moratorium. I tell you what we will do. We will steadfastly focus on affordable, reliable energy for all Australians and we will not put in place policies that are going to double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas as those opposite proposed at the last election.” In the meantime, Luke Gosling is thrown out for a very loud interjection. Tony Smith is dealing with points of order on how Angus Taylor is not actually answering the question. They have called in Christian Porter to answer whether or not Taylor was answering the question. Taylor is back: Mr Speaker, and as I was saying, emissions in that year were 100m tonnes, over 100m tonnes below what was forecast by the climate change authority in 2013, and now it is true Mr Speaker, it is true Mr Speaker from year to year and quarter to quarter, emissions go up and down. That is what happens, Mr Speaker. But it is all LNG’s fault. He is done. Taylor is not having a good day. Speaking of the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten is back from leave and in the chamber. Mark Butler to ... #WELLDONEANGUS It’s like watching a wounded gazelle being slowly cut off from the pack. “My question again is to the member for emissions reduction: did Australia’s total annual carbon emissions rise in the year to December 2016?” Taylor: As I say I am delighted* to take questions from the member for Port Adelaide. He absolutely refused to answer any questions on his policy during the election campaign. And the member for Maribyrnong was not much better, Mr Speaker, wasn’t much better. I have already answered this question, Mr Speaker, in the previous answer but what I can tell you, what I can tell you is that in 2013, in 2013 ...” *He was not, in fact, delighted. Michael McCormack is attempting to answer a question his office wrote. It’s going about how you would expect. Bob Katter has a question for Scott Morrison about dams – I think. It includes the phrase of whether or not this would make Morrison “the modern day Moses”. Morrison asks if Katter was in the back row of his church because they were just talking about Moses on Sunday. This is all going into Hansard. “Watch your temper,” someone from Labor yells at Taylor as he takes back his seat. He may have caught on to Labor’s strategy. There are graphs on the paper he is looking at. Greg Hunt has come over to talk to him. There is a lot of hand waving. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Did Australia’s total carbon emissions rise to the year to December 2017? Taylor: I’m delighted to take these questions from you because during the election campaign you were not able to answer a single question on the cost of impacts of your energy policies, Mr Speaker! Not a single question! Mr Speaker, we have seen again in the last year a reduction in emissions per capita in emissions intensity and in the electricity sector and it is true of the absolute level there was a small increase in the last 12 months. That was driven entirely, entirely Mr Speaker, by a growth in LNG exports and ...” And he’s decided he has finished his answer. Yesterday it was the day of the female MP dixer. Today, so far, it’s Queensland day, with Julian Simmonds followed by Phil Thompson. The government is still talking about its tax package, which has passed. Tony Smith is triggered by the LNG export reference, so he again pulls Angus Taylor, the Rhode’s scholar (how do you know he’s a Rhode’s scholar? He’ll tell you) and tells him to answer the question. #WelldoneAngus: Thank you, and as I said, we are at the lowest levels of emissions per person in 29 years and they have been falling year on year, and it is true from year to year they bump up and down, and in the last year there is no doubt, there is no doubt that LNG exports have had an impact, have had an impact on our emissions. There is no doubt about that. But let’s talk about that because in the last year our LNG exports reduced global emissions by up to 26% of our total emissions, because when you sell LNG up into China and Korea and Asia, even though there were the increased emissions from the extraction of that LNG, we see a reduction in global emissions.” Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Did Australia’s total emissions rise in 2018? Taylor: As I said, we are in our 28th year of economic growth and the emissions per capita are the lowest years, the lowest level in 29 years. From year to year emissions ... we inherited from you opposite a 700m tonne deficit. But there is no doubt that there was upward pressure in recent years on emissions driven by growth in LNG, and that growth in LNG.” I get it. My weight has been subject to upward pressure, too. The first dixer goes to Julian Simmonds, who has asked Scott Morrison just how safe and secure Australia is. VERY is the short answer. The rest of it is about tax relief and border security which, now that has been signed off on with the help of Labor, is about the sum of the government’s agenda. Angus Taylor starts talking about LNG exports. Tony Smith pulls him up before Labor even has a chance to laugh, and tells him he has strayed way off topic. Smith also tells Josh Frydenberg to stop interjecting. Meanwhile, some wags from the Coalition backbench ask about Labor’s primary vote, saying that has gone down. It did. The Coalition’s primary wasn’t exactly historic either. But you know what hasn’t gone down? Australia’s emissions. Anyway, the answer is emissions are going up. Anthony Albanese to Angus Taylor (I miss most of it, but it about whether greenhouse emissions are going up or down.) The minister for emissions reduction: “I would like to inform the house that Australia is currently in its 28th year of economic growth and emissions per capita ... “As I was saying, the lowest level of emissions per capita in 29 years, Mr Speaker, and the lowest level of emissions intensity in 29 years. Our electricity sector emissions are down 6.5 million tonnes on the year to December 2018. We have seen during that year the highest level of renewable investment in the world. Double the next country in the world. And we are on target to exceed our Kyoto obligations for 2020 by 367 million tonnes.” Albanese says the question was easy: up or down. Tony Smith goes to answer the point of order, and Taylor gets back up, to which Smith tells him to sit down because he hasn’t be called to do anything yet. #welldoneAngus. He’s a Rhode’s scholar don’t cha you know. Scott Morrison is in the House. Question time is about to begin. It’s time for “Who’s that MP?” It’s Kevin Andrews, making yet another invaluable contribution to the Australian parliament from one of the safest electorates in the nation. We are just about to head into the chamber for question time. Paul Karp has your Senate needs covered. Hit me up with your QT predictions. I have a feeling this one will be quite interesting. In other non-surprising news, Labor is also going to allow the (soon to be $5bn) future drought fund to pass through the Senate. The government had the numbers on that anyway. Labor had said it would pass “any number” the government wanted, as long as it was new money. The government plans on redirecting the funding from the Building Australia Fund, which was a Labor initiative which has largely sat dormant under the Coalition. Thank you to the secret squirrel who reminded me of the metadata report the government was due to table yesterday. It did table it. It’s here. It is for July 2016 to June 2017. The date on the report cover sheet is November 2018. It was tabled yesterday, 22 July 2019. That’s a two-year-old report that sat somewhere for nine months. This is the amendment Labor will attempt to move on the temporary exclusion order legislation, before the government ignores it, and then Labor supports the bill anyway. That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that: (a) the government has failed to implement in full at least 10 recommendations of the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, without explanation; (b) this is the first time since 2013 that this government has ever openly rejected recommendations of the bipartisan committee; and (c) this rejection constitutes a significant breach of the compact between the opposition and the government on national security bills, which is premised on an understanding that the recommendations of the bipartisan committee are to be respected and implemented; and (2) is of the view that: (a) it is not the job of this parliament to act as a rubber stamp for government bills; the parliament’s job is to get legislation right; (b) this bill should therefore be amended so that it conforms faithfully to the detailed recommendations of the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security; and (c) this bill should be referred back to the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security for further scrutiny.” tl;dr - shut the hell up. You know what it absolutely is not and was never going to be? A third chamber. Just more on what Labor has decided re Newstart. Linda Burney brought the submission to caucus – that Labor not only wants to review the Newstart payment, but increase it. Before that was just the implied position. So it will now head to the Senate standing committee on economics, but there won’t be a dollar figure put on the rate. Labor wants to know who is having trouble finding work and why, as well as what will be the economic value to raising the rate. Labor won’t vote for the Greens bill because it does not want to support a dollar amount figure just yet. Plus you can’t have money bills originate in the Senate (under the constitution, it can’t deal with finances). I am SHOCKED. SHOCKED* I say, about the findings of this study from RMIT. A study of dictators over the past 150 years shows they are rarely associated with strong economies, and quite often with weaker ones. Autocratic leaders are often credited with purposefully delivering good economic outcomes, such as the late Lee Kuan-Yew, who is widely credited with Singapore’s prosperity. But new research published in the Leadership Quarterly journal by researchers from RMIT University and Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, challenges that long-held assumption. RMIT economist Dr Ahmed Skali said robust analysis of data on economic growth, political regimes and political leaders from 1858 to 2010 found dictators rarely oversaw strong economies. “In an era where voters are willingly trading their political freedoms in exchange for promises of strong economic performance to strongman figures like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin or Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it’s important to understand whether autocratic leaders do deliver economic growth,” Skali said. “ ... Autocrats whose countries experienced larger than average economic growth were found only as frequently as you would predict based on chance alone. “In contrast, autocrats overseeing poor economic growth were found significantly more frequently than chance would predict. “Taken together, these two results cast serious doubt on the view that autocratic leaders are successful at promoting economic growth.” *Not actually shocked. I am Lithuanian after all. Anyone who is surprised by Labor’s position on the temporary exclusion orders shouldn’t be. This nation has had a bipartisan position on national security, pretty much since we were sent to war after 9/11. And it was so successfully weaponised that any questioning of any legislation which has a national security element leads to WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON attacks. And so we have yet another national security bill about to sail through the parliament. Even though there are concerns over the bill. Even though a joint, bipartisan committee, which is government heavy, has recommendations the government is not accepting. That pesky constitution again Quelle surprise And just in case you missed Murph’s story from this morning: The independent health advice panel overseeing medical transfers for asylum seekers languishing offshore says there were 73 admissions covering 43 people at the RPC medical centre on Nauru in the first quarter of 2019, with ‘the majority’ relating to mental health conditions. The first quarterly report of the independent panel, obtained by Labor under an order for the production of documents in the Senate, found that in addition to the 73 admissions, with stays ranging between one and 44 days, there were 8,260 medical consultations provided to people on Nauru in the quarter – mostly for mental health problems. The new figures underscoring significant problems with the mental health and wellbeing of asylum seekers, and people whose asylum claims have failed, came as the Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent declared on Monday Australia could not continue with ‘indefinite detention’. It being Tuesday, party rooms are under way. The Greens have resolved to try to amend the government’s drought legislation to say it should not be funded by the Building Australia Fund but instead by the petroleum resources rent tax. Given the Senate can’t actually impose that change without creating constitutional issues, this proposal will be put in a second reading amendment just as a proposal. I’d be surprised if that got wide-ranging support in the Senate but strange things happen and I will keep an eye out. Other amendments are proposed to increase transparency from the fund, make the grants and the investment mandate disallowable, and ensure practice is consistent with the Murray-Darling Basin plan. A couple of insights too, from the Greens national conference at the weekend. We’ve reported that there has been some internal debate about a proposal to give party members a say in electing the federal leader. The conference resolved to make a final decision on the model for giving members a say by next May (bearing in mind that this discussion has been going on inside the Greens since 2016). The Greens will also attempt to build support in this parliament for declaring a climate emergency. Joel Fitzgibbon responded to Michael McCormack’s comments, also on Sky, saying his “just move” policy was not a stroke of genius, but something you say when you have no policy. I am sorry, but that is such a privileged view from our deputy prime minister. Let’s assume you are in the best case scenario to take up his advice, and don’t have children or dependants – for whom you would need to find care while you move to a place where you know no one – are healthy, have previous experience and no pets. You still need money to move. Best case scenario that will cost you $2,000, and that is doing it yourself, with limited furniture. You need bond money – again, let’s assume rent of $200 a week, so that is $800. We’ve hit $3,000 and you haven’t even hit the pavement yet. Politicians receive more travel allowance in a day when they are in Canberra than people on Newstart receive in a week. Those extra payments the government harps on about, at best, add about $10 a week. It is not as easy as “move and you’ll find work”. And that has nothing to do with talking regional communities down, which is one of Michael McCormack’s favourite complaints about city media. Many of us come from rural and regional communities, have family and friends there. Living in a city doesn’t mean you have no understanding of how the rest of the nation works. But living in a privileged position and pretending you don’t need to raise the unemployment benefit – the benefit that everyone from social service councils to the business community say needs to increase because it’s been close to 20 years since it was seriously reviewed – and people can just “move” to get jobs? That’s some bubble bullshit right there. Michael McCormack on Newstart, after questioning from Kieran Gilbert on Sky News: There are jobs out there in regional Australia and there are good paying jobs and what I think we do need in this country is a more mobile workforce. And so people have to be prepared to move sometimes out of their comfort zone and their home town and move to the next town to take a job. There are jobs there – it is just that you’re not always going to get a job in the home town you’ve grown up in; you’re not always going to get the job that you actually want for the right here and now. But a job, any job will be better than none at all and it will be better than living on welfare. Certainly with Newstart, it is that safety net measure. It is not meant to be a living wage. What we support is more jobs growth, and we’ve already through business helped create the economic conditions to grow [jobs].” Asked how people are supposed to live and feed themselves on Newstart – and look for work, given the transport and accommodation costs – McCormack says: “Indeed, and it would be a very meagre existence, but it is only supposed to be a safety net out there, between jobs. There are jobs out there, and that is why I encourage people who have either slipped through the cracks, and they just can’t find work at the moment, to look around. There are many jobs. “You go into Dubbo and it is almost full employment in Dubbo and you go up the main streets of some regional towns, indeed, regional capitals, and there are notes in the windows that say ‘job available, apply within’ and there are so many jobs, and people have to have the wherewithal to go to those places and have the capacity and indeed have the innovative spirit to actually move out of their home town where they have lived all their life and go to a town where there are jobs available.” You know what it takes to move towns? MONEY. Which people on Newstart DO NOT HAVE. Michael McCormack sees jobs, people. Party room and caucus are on right now, which is why it is so quiet. We’ll bring you the updates when those meetings break. The Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance is a bit cranky with the government over its proposed legislation to tackle (illegally) phoenix businesses – companies which are deliberately liquidated to avoid debts, and then restarted as a new business. From its statement: The Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance (ATA), a 75,000+ member national grassroots advocacy group that represents the nation’s taxpayers, today condemned new powers proposed for the Australian Taxation Office under the Morrison government’s Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Illegal Phoenixing) Bill 2019 which is listed for debate in parliament this week. “By granting the ATO the power to make its own arbitrary estimates about how much GST a business will owe without any independent review or appeals process prior to the imposition of liability, this shocking new legislation is likely to drive innocent and hardworking taxpaying businesses bankrupt,” said Satya Marar, ATA’s director of policy. “Taxpayers nationwide should be even more concerned as these powers will be backed by the threat of withholding tax refunds and making small business owners personally liable before any legal or factual dispute is resolved.” Side note, but lovely news: Labor MP Amanda Rishworth welcomed Oscar Walker into the world yesterday, making him the first baby of the 46th parliament. And just in case it is of interest, there have been 33 boat turnbacks since 2013, when the Coalition was elected. But don’t take my word for it. Here is the official report on it, which was largely created from numbers provided to Senate estimates. After two and a bit days of actual parliament sitting, Anthony Albanese finishes with this view on how he sees the government’s behaviour so far: This government is obsessed by looking for arguments rather than looking for solutions. They won the election in May. And ever since then they’ve acted like an opposition in exile. They looking for wedge politics. On each occasion they are putting up legislation they are not saying we’re putting this forward because it’s in the national interest. They saying we’re putting this forward because it’s a test for Labor. That’s a bizarre way for a government that was elected just two months ago into its third term to be behaving. That follows Scott Morrison’s assertion during question time on Monday that Labor, under Albanese, was back to being the opposition with a capital O. Which is, you know, strange, given that so far Labor has voted with the government on all its major pieces of legislation – namely the tax package and drought funding, even if it has expressed concerns with parts of the bill. Asked by Sky News’s Laura Jayes about Labor’s position on the temporary exclusion orders, Anthony Albanese had this to say: What we’ll be doing is, one, Kristina Keneally has written to Peter Dutton asking for the legislation to be referred back to the joint intelligence committee. The joint intelligence committee has operated very well. These are difficult circumstances. We live in an unsafe world. And the joint intelligence committee has been able to receive briefings from the security agencies, has been able to come to positions on a unanimous basis. It’s chaired by Andrew Hastie, there is a majority of government members on that committee, and every single one of its recommendations for a number of years have been adopted by the parliament and supported by Labor and the Coalition. Now, what’s happened with the temporary exclusion orders is that a number of the recommendations that were made unanimously by the committee chair, Andrew Hastie, had been rejected by the government. The government hasn’t made a case of why that is, why that’s occurring. Some of those recommendations are based upon international experience, for example, that it should be under the UK legislation – it’s a judge who’s able to make the determination rather than the minister. The government hasn’t put forward a reason why that should be done any differently. It also has a recommendation that we needed to take into account whether there is somewhere else for the person affected by the order to go. And the reason why that was the case, of course, was because of people concerned about legal challenges on these issues. So a commonsense approach is what we’re taking, Laura, an approach that’s consistent with what was previously a bipartisan position. One of Peter Dutton’s main reasons for wanting to repeal the medevac legislation is that it contains no processes for returning asylum seekers or refugees to Manus Island or Nauru once their treatment has been completed. Which is interesting, given that the vast majority of people brought to the mainland for treatment under the previous government regime (which often involved the federal court ordering the government to bring people for treatment, a judicial power the government was attempting to challenge) are still in Australia, receiving treatment. Anyone brought to Australia for treatment remains in detention. They are not released into the community and are escorted to their appointments. They remain under guard. Anthony Albanese was on Sky this morning and had this to say about the report a boat from Sri Lanka was intercepted on its way to Australia: This is only been put in the Australian newspaper by the usual, the usual suspects. And I am prepared to say that has obviously been put there by the government ... Well because – who else has put it there? The asylum seekers themselves?” On the medevac repeal legislation, which has been sent to a parliamentary committee for review and report back in October (meaning it probably won’t hit the parliament again until November), Albanese had this to say when asked if Labor was willing to “tweak it”: No. The fact is, it’s working. If the government has any practical suggestions I can put them forward, but they haven’t done that. They’ve just engaged in rhetoric. There are some 90 people who have been brought to Australia under the medevac legislation; there’s 900 who have been brought to Australia by the government itself prior to the medevac legislation being there. So the government hasn’t, I don’t believe, made a case for change. This legislation was pretty straightforward. It allowed for the minister himself to appoint the committee that makes the decisions about these matters. Indeed, a number of the objections have been upheld by the committee when issues have been raised. Quite clearly, the government rhetoric was if this legislation was passed last December, then there would be floods of boats coming and everyone who was currently in offshore processing would be brought to Australia. That hasn’t happened. And indeed, the numbers of 90 are very modest compared to the numbers of 900 which occurred previously.” Not a total surprise, given the first week was mostly taken up with pomp and ceremony, but the Senate sort of ran out of legislation to debate last night. Penny Wong’s eyebrows were at peak Penny Wong as she delivered this spray to the government in the Senate just before 8.30pm: It’s the Monday of this sitting week, and we have the government saying, ‘Guess what? We have run out of legislation in the Senate. We want to go to the address-in-reply.’ The same old tried and true delaying tactic that governments use when they have to fill Senate chamber time. They’ve already gone to that at 8.25pm on the Monday night of the sitting week. What is the government’s agenda? Where is the government’s agenda? The government doesn’t have an agenda for the Senate. Do you know why? Because you’ve just spent the day in the House of Representatives trying to gain a wedge on the Labor party to abolish the Building Australia Fund because you want to talk about drought. You’ve had a situation where the prime minister is so focused on playing politics that he hasn’t even wanted to allow the shadow cabinet to meet to determine a position. He hasn’t wanted to allow the caucus to meet to determine a position. He’s so desperate to make sure he gets a political wedge up, and you come in here and, so embarrassingly, don’t have any legislation for the Senate that you have to go to the address-in-reply at 8.25pm on the Monday night of a sitting week. What are we all doing? We’re all sitting here waiting for Mr Morrison to get the votes through the House of Representatives, which he hasn’t got as yet, on legislation to abolish the Building Australia Fund because he wants to try and wedge the Labor party on drought. If you ever wanted an example of a government that doesn’t have an agenda, you have it now. You have it with senator Ruston sitting here saying, ‘You do what you want, senator Wong, because we don’t have any legislation. I’ve got an address-in-reply I want to get in. That’s what I want to do because I want delay tactics, as the government manager, as long as possible.’ Here is senator Cormann. He’s coming in to make up an agenda. You’re on to the address-in-reply at 8.25 on a Monday night because you haven’t got any legislation. I say the Senate should adjourn until you’ve got an agenda to debate. The reason you haven’t got an agenda today is because you’ve been so focused on playing politics in the lower house and you haven’t got any legislation through. You could have put legislation through the lower house today. But you haven’t. Instead you’ve chosen to delay because you want a political debate on the Building Australia Fund abolition. That is entirely what is occurring.” Welcome to day two of parliament – which is day 15 for the year. Because 2019 is the new 2004, we are talking national security and WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON. Peter Dutton has decided temporary exclusion orders, which have been in place in the UK since 2015, is URGENT with a capital POLITICS and is pushing the parliament into passing the bill, without taking into account all the recommendations from the joint parliamentary security committee. That committee is headed up by Liberal Andrew Hastie, and recommended a range of changes, including that there be some judicial oversight of any temporary exclusion order. Labor has said it is willing to support the spirit of the laws, but wants a tad more oversight. Cue all of the WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON rhetoric. Or, if you are Michael McCormack, WHICH SIDE DO YOU SIT ON. Kristina Keneally had this to say, this morning: Labor has always supported the intent of the temporary exclusion order (TEO) legislation and any claims otherwise – such as this bill being a “test for Labor” – are nonsense. Labor and the Liberals have already come together in agreeing to support the TEO laws subject to the bipartisan recommendations made by the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS), a Liberal-dominated committee which is chaired by Liberal MP Andrew Hastie. The PJCIS has operated for years to achieve bipartisanship on national security legislation. Since 2013 the government has not explicitly rejected a recommendation of the PJCIS. The cooperative value of the PJCIS to reach consensus and improve national security legislation provides significant benefit to our national security agencies and to Australians. The government should not jeopardise or politicise the important work of the PJCIS.” Meanwhile, the fact a third boat from Sri Lanka had been intercepted on its way to Australia managed to find its way into the Australian newspaper, just as Dutton and the government attempt to gain support to repeal medevac. Yes, medevac has been in place since February, but there was also a pretty awful terrorist attack in Sri Lanka earlier this year, but that doesn’t tend to get mentioned. We’ll bring you all of the national security argy bargy, as well as the fight over drought funding, as this brave new civil parliament enters its second week of sitting. Mike Bowers is out and about, and you’ll also have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp helping to steer the ship. Ready?

She worked her way through university as a model and waitress, studying medieval English history before graduating from New York University School of Law, where she described herself as “a bit of a leftie”. She initially worked as a corporate lawyer and became the youngest member of the US Securities and Exchange Commission at 33. She then moved to Hong Kong to work for the British merchant bank Samuel Montagu, becoming its first female director. Later Judge became the executive director of Rupert Murdoch’s News International and relocated to London where she founded the investment firm Private Equity Investor in the 1990s. A strong advocate of nuclear power, Judge became chair of the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 2004. During her tenure as the head of the UK’s Pension Protection Fund between 2010 and 2016, she was also drafted in by Tokyo Electric Power Company to help assure the residents of Fukushima that its reactors were safe after the nuclear disaster there, and was hailed as “Japan’s nuclear saviour”. The 71-year-old’s many roles have included business ambassador on behalf of the former government department UK Trade &amp; Investment, and deputy chairman of the UK Financial Reporting Council. She was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to the nuclear and financial services industries. However, just months after she became the Institute of Directors’ first female chair in February 2015, she faced calls to quit because of her involvement with the coal company responsible for the US’s worst coalmine disaster in 40 years. She sat on committees overseeing safety and corporate governance at Massey Energy when a coal dust explosion killed 29 workers in West Virginia in 2010. Before the explosion, institutional investors and union groups had said Judge, who held multiple directorships, would not be able to devote enough time to addressing Massey’s safety issues. In 2016, Judge said long maternity breaks were bad for women, and suggested those taking a year off were risking losing their jobs. She took 12 days off work when her son was born. She was married to the former Conservative party fundraiser Sir Paul Judge, who died last year. She sits on the board of the charity Dementia UK and has been involved with the Royal Academy of Arts as chair of Benjamin West group atrons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/19/fukushima-disaster-japanese-power-company-chiefs-cleared-of-negligence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-19T04:36:57Z","webTitle":"Fukushima disaster: Japanese power company chiefs cleared of negligence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/fukushima-disaster-japanese-power-company-chiefs-cleared-of-negligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/19/fukushima-disaster-japanese-power-company-chiefs-cleared-of-negligence","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima disaster: Japanese power company chiefs cleared of negligence","bodyText":"Three former executives at the company that runs the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been acquitted of failing to prevent the March 2011 nuclear meltdown, in the only criminal action resulting from the disaster. Tsunehisa Katsumata, a former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and former vice presidents Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro, had apologised for the triple meltdown at the plant, but said they could not have foreseen the massive tsunami that triggered the disaster. Prosecutors had accused the former executives of failing to act on information that showed the risks to the plant from a major tsunami. While no one is officially recorded as having died as a direct result of the meltdown, the charges related to 44 elderly people who died during or after they were forcibly evacuated from local hospitals. The defendants had all pleaded not guilty to charges of professional negligence resulting in death, arguing that the data available to them before the disaster was unreliable. “It is difficult to deal with issues that are uncertain and obscure,” Takekuro said during the trial at the Tokyo district court. Prosecutors had demanded a five-year prison term for each of the men. Outside the court, protesters voiced anger at the verdict. “I cannot accept this,” one woman said. Greenpeace accused Japan’s legal system of failing to protect the right of tens of thousands of people affected by the Fukushima meltdown. Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany, said a guilty verdict would have dealt a “devastating blow” to Tepco, the pro-nuclear government of prime minister Shinzo Abe and Japan’s nuclear industry. “It is therefore perhaps not a surprise that the court has failed to rule based on the evidence,” Burnie, who is currently in Tokyo, said in a statement. “More than eight years after the start of this catastrophe, Tepco and the government are still avoiding being held to full account for their decades of ignoring the science of nuclear risks.” The Fukushima Daiichi plant suffered meltdowns in three of its six reactors after it was struck by a tsunami on 11 March 2011. Waves reaching up to 14 metres (46 feet) in height knocked out the plant’s backup power supply, causing fuel inside the reactors to melt. Prosecutors had argued that Katsumata, Muto and Takekuro should have understood the risk a huge tsunami posed and had failed to take necessary safety measures. The men were present at meetings where experts warned of the threat posed by large tsunamis off the Fukushima coast and had access to data and warning that a tsunami exceeding 10m (33ft) could trigger power loss and a major disaster at the plant. In addition, a Tepco internal study, based on a 2002 report by a respected government panel, concluded that a wave of up to 15.7m (52ft) could strike after a magnitude-8.3 quake. The earthquake that triggered the March 2011 tsunami was recorded as magnitude-9.0. The tsunami killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast, including Fukushima. The nuclear meltdown sent plumes of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of 160,000 people living near the plant, some of whom are still unable to return to their homes. Tepco has said it will take 40 years to locate and remove the melted fuel from the reactor cores, although some experts believe decommissioning could take longer. The government has estimated that the total cost of dismantling the plant, decontaminating surrounding areas and compensating victims at about $200bn. The embattled utility is soon expected to decide the fate of more than a million tonnes of contaminated water stored at the site. The most likely option – discharging the water in the Pacific ocean – is strongly opposed by local fishermen who have spent that last eight years rebuilding their industry. Initially it appeared unlikely that the executives would ever face criminal proceedings. Prosecutors twice declined to proceed with the case, citing a lack of evidence and slim odds for a conviction. The case went to court, however, after a judicial review panel comprising ordinary citizens ruled in 2015 that the three men should face trial. Hiroyuki Kawai, a lawyer representing more than 5,700 Fukushima residents who filed the criminal complaint against the former executives, said before the ruling that he expected the legal battle to last about a decade because the losing side would appeal. “This is only the beginning of a major battle,” he said at a rally. “Our ultimate goal is to eradicate dangerous nuclear plants that have thrown many residents into despair.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/05/seaweed-shuts-nuclear-reactor-edf-torness-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T11:46:11Z","webTitle":"In a laver: seaweed shuts nuclear reactor again in bad weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/05/seaweed-shuts-nuclear-reactor-edf-torness-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/05/seaweed-shuts-nuclear-reactor-edf-torness-plant","fields":{"headline":"In a laver: seaweed shuts nuclear reactor again in bad weather","bodyText":"Roving jellyfish and seaweed have long been unwanted guests at Scotland’s last two nuclear power stations. Now the marine algae have hit again, forcing one of the plants to partially power down despite freezing temperatures pushing up demand for electricity. During last week’s cold weather, excessive amounts of seaweed entered the cooling system of the Torness plant in East Lothian, causing one reactor to be closed on Thursday. Its owner, EDF Energy, said the measure had been taken due to the “risk of marine ingress”. After several days of reduced output, the power station was gradually returning to full power on Monday. Together with Hunterston on the west coast, the plants normally provide about a third of Scotland’s electricity needs. An EDF spokesperson said: “We know that at certain times of year particular weather conditions in this part of the Forth estuary can lead to increased seaweed volumes which can enter the station’s cooling water intake system. Our staff are trained to respond in this situation, and to take the plant offline if necessary.” It is not the first time that Torness has been affected by seaborne nuisances. The site was closed twice in 2013 due to seaweed clogging the plant’s cooling system, and jellyfish caused the plant’s units to temporarily shut down in 2011. Torness, which opened in 1988, was scheduled to close in 2023 but two years ago EDF Energy announced it was extending the plant’s lifetime to 2030 to maintain secure electricity supplies. Several of the UK’s other eight remaining nuclear power stations are due to shut earlier, in the 2020s. Heysham nuclear power station in Lancashire and Sizewell B in Suffolk are also running at reduced power, due to planned maintenance. However, during the recent freezing weather, Britain’s nuclear sector has been consistently providing about a fifth of UK electricity supplies. EDF Energy, along with other generators, will have benefited from high power prices in the past few days, a knock-on effect of the extremely strong gas demand for heating. Wholesale electricity prices, which are normally about £45 per megawatt hour, reached spikes of £990/MWh on Thursday, the coldest spring day on record. Prices remained high on Monday, hitting £109/MWh in the morning. Analysts ICIS said weekend power prices were roughly double the average seen in 2017. Britain’s rapidly dwindling fleet of coal power stations have surged in the past few weeks, with coal providing a quarter of electricity on Saturday. Experts at Bernstein bank said the “beast from the east” would have been particularly positive for Drax, which runs a large coal and biomass power station in North Yorkshire. • This article was amended on 8 March 2018 because an earlier version abbreviated megawatt hour to mWh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-russian-troop-withdrawal-designed-to-mislead-says-ukrainian-military-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-31T04:40:58Z","webTitle":"Germany could ration power if fuel standoff continues - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-russian-troop-withdrawal-designed-to-mislead-says-ukrainian-military-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-russian-troop-withdrawal-designed-to-mislead-says-ukrainian-military-live","fields":{"headline":"Germany could ration power if fuel standoff continues - as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is now closed. Please follow our continuing live coverage here: Here is a comprehensive rundown of the latest developments over the past 12 hours: The Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated from Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Agence France-Presse. Russia and Ukraine will resume online peace talks on Friday 1 April. A senior Ukraine official said leaders of the two countries, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, could meet “soon”, but the Kremlin downplayed hopes of an early breakthrough. Ukraine’s president said in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday that “for the moment there are just words, nothing concrete”. Zelenskiy said he talked to Joe Biden for an hour on another “very active diplomatic day”, thanking the US president for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. Zelenskiy said: “The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world.” The Ukrainian president also said he was cautious of Russia’s “verbal constructions” and described the movement of Russian troops as “not a withdrawal, but the consequences of exile”. “Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics,” he added. A recent Russian military report appears to contradict Russia’s promise to withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s north following “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday. The report from Russia’s ministry of defence published in a Telegram post late on Wednesday states Russia is merely undertaking a “planned regrouping of troops” after successfully completing its military objectives in Kyiv and Chernihiv. Russian shelling continued on Wednesday despite Moscow saying on Tuesday that it would scale back its attacks around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. However, reports citing the Pentagon said that Russian forces were “walking away” from the Chernobyl nuclear plant. UK, US and EU officials say Putin has been misled over Russian military performance. Putin has received misinformation about how well Russia is doing and how much the sanctions have affected the country because some of those closest to him are afraid to tell him the truth, according to a speech planned by the head of Britain’s GCHQ spy service on Thursday. Sir Jeremy Fleming is also expected to say that some Russian soldiers are refusing to carry out orders, and that they are poorly equipped and have low morale. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters at a briefing: “It’s his [Putin] military. It’s his war. He chose it...the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting. Global restrictions on exports of industrial components to Russia have hit car and tank production. A carmaker has shut down and tank production has halted, according to the US. President Joe Biden’s administration is considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day for several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to reduce gasoline prices, two senior US officials have said. The Russian rouble has recovered to its pre-war value despite western sanctions on the country’s exports and financial systems. Germany could ration power if a standoff over a Russian demand to pay for fuel with roubles disrupts or halts supplies. President Joe Biden’s administration is also considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day for several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to reduce gasoline prices, two senior US officials said. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India on Thursday to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia. Her arrival in New Delhi coincides with that of her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who will be making his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK has announced new laws targeting the access of Russian oligarchs to “UK aviation and maritime technical services”, according to the Foreign Office. Eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted “golden visas” to live in Britain. The individuals were granted the right to live in the UK after promising to invest at least £2m under the controversial tier 1 investor visa scheme, the UK government has admitted. Russian hackers have recently attempted to penetrate the networks of Nato and the militaries of some eastern European countries, according to a report by Google’s threat analysis group. The report did not say which militaries had been targeted in what Google described as “credential phishing campaigns” launched by a Russian-based group called Coldriver, or Callisto. Slovakia has said it will expel 35 Russian diplomats based on information provided by intelligence services. Fellow EU countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic have all announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia considers the presence of any US or Nato military infrastructure in countries bordering Afghanistan unacceptable, Russian state media outlet Tass is reporting. It could take at least a year for Ukraine to hold a referendum on its neutrality - a key Russian demand to end the war - according to the head of Ukraine’s delegation at peace talks with Russia. Russia has said it considers the presence of any US or Nato military infrastructure in countries bordering Afghanistan unacceptable, Russian state media outlet Tass is reporting. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the west is trying to use the UN to “create artificial competition” in its efforts in Afghanistan, the agency said. Citing Lavrov, Tass reported: The Russian Federation considers it unacceptable to deploy any US and Nato military infrastructure on the territory of states neighbouring Afghanistan. Washington is trying to avoid responsibility for the fate of Afghan citizens and refugees. The United States, through its influence in the IMF and the World Bank, is hindering the implementation of social programs in Afghanistan.” The Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated from Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Agence France-Presse. A humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via the Russian-controlled port of Berdiansk, would be opened from 10am (7am GMT), the ministry said on Wednesday. “For this humanitarian operation to succeed, we propose to carry it out with the direct participation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross,” the ministry statement said. The Russian ministry asked Kyiv to guarantee the “unconditional respect” for the ceasefire through written notification to the Russian side, the UNHCR and ICRC before 6am (3am GMT) Thursday. Moscow also asked the Ukrainian army to commit to ensure the security of the bus convoys along the designated corridor. The ministry also said it had agreed to a proposal from Kyiv to open in the last 24 hours four new humanitarian corridors from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. US President Joe Biden has promised to end the “nightmare” of Americans detained in Russia after meeting with the parents of a former US Marine imprisoned in Russia on Wednesday. US citizen Trevor Reed is serving a nine-year prison term in a penal colony some 500 km (300 miles) southeast of Moscow after being convicted of assaulting police officers while drunk in 2019. “President Biden met today with Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, who is wrongfully detained in Russia,” presidential spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. “During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere.” “We understand the pain felt by all of Trevor’s families and friends enduring the nightmare of his absence, which we are committed to bringing to an end.” US State department spokesman Ned Price earlier said that US diplomats are being denied access to Americans being held by Russia. Those include Reed and Paul Whelan, who are being held on what the United States says are false or trumped-up charges, and professional basketball Brittney Griner, who was detained in Moscow airport on 17 February 17 on charges of carrying vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil in her luggage. The Russian rouble has recovered to its pre-war value despite western sanctions on the country’s exports and financial systems. The currency was trading at 75.5 to one US dollar on Thursday morning, compared with almost 140 to the dollar at the beginning of March when it crashed with the onest of sanctions. That is actually better than it was on 22 February, two days before the invasion, when it was at 80 per dollar. Russia has bolstered the currency by raising interest rates to 20% – therefore encouraging investment in the rouble – and imposing capital controls which mean that people cannot swap roubles for other currencies. The Kremlin’s threat to make European gas importers like Germany pay for their supplies in roubles – thus boosting the currency’s value – has also helped. More help has come from China and India, which have increased the amount of Russian oil they are buying thanks to generous discounts from Moscow. A recent Russian military report appears to contradict Russia’s promise to withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s north following “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday. Following the talks, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. The promises were seemingly made in good faith, however a recent report from Russia’s ministry of defence published in a Telegram post late on Wednesday states Russia is merely undertaking a “planned regrouping of troops” after successfully completing its military objectives in Kyiv and Chernihiv. The report, titled ‘highlights of the day’, reads: All the main tasks of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kyiv and Chernigov [Chernihiv] directions have been completed. A planned regrouping of troops is taking place in these areas, its goal is to intensify actions in priority areas and, above all, complete the operation to completely liberate Donbas.” Western and Ukrainian officials reacted warily to Russia’s claim, publicly voicing their scepticism. In an intelligence report published by Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces on Wednesday did note that Russian troops were withdrawing from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but described the movement as merely “a rotation of individual units” with aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. The report read: According to some indications, the Russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the east. At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers’ refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.” A somewhat exasperated Zelenskiy has said peace talks with Russia are ongoing but nothing “concrete” has come out of them. The Ukrainian leader released another video address from the streets of the capital, saying Russia is continuing to mass troops near Donbas and any withdrawal form near Kyiv was due to Ukrainian resistance. “We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of... the work of our defenders,” he said. “But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this.” Watch Zelenskiy’s latest address in the video below. It could take at least a year for Ukraine to hold a referendum on its neutrality - a key Russian demand to end the war - according to the head of Ukraine’s delegation at peace talks with Russia. David Arakhamia told the Financial Times that the parties were close to agreement on the security guarantees and Ukraine’s EU bid, but urged caution about the prospects for a breakthrough. “All the issues” have been “on the table since the beginning” of negotiations but “lots of points — like in every single item there are unresolved points”, Arakhamia said. Any prospective deal would have to be agreed with the guarantors and ratified by their parliaments, Zelenskiy reiterated on Sunday. Ukraine would then put the deal to a national referendum where any decision would ultimately be made by the people of Ukraine. This would not occur until perhaps several months’ time before a possible change to constitution — a process that could require at least a year. The only resolved [issue] is the type of international guarantees Ukraine is looking for, but . . . we still have to get the approval from the guarantors otherwise the deal will never fly,” Arakhamia said. In a TV interview, Arakhamia said declaring neutrality would require three million signatures to be registered. “This is a big procedure that cannot take place outside of peaceful territory,” he said. Germany could ration power if a standoff over a Russian demand to pay for fuel with roubles disrupts or halts supplies. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Wednesday implemented the “early warning phase” of an existing gas emergency plan, where a crisis team from the economics ministry, the regulator and the private sector will monitor imports and storage. Habeck told reporters Germany’s gas supplies were guaranteed for now but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that “every kilowatt hour counts”. If supplies fall short, Germany’s network regulator can ration gas, with industry first in line for cuts and preferential treatment for private households, hospitals and other critical institutions. Paying in Russia’s currency would undercut the effectiveness of western sanctions on the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and Germany, which depends on Russia for much of its natural gas, is under pressure not to accede to the demand. Moscow is expected to make public its plans for rouble payments on Thursday, Reuters says, although it said it would not immediately demand that buyers pay for gas exports in the currency. As analysts waited for more clarity on the situation and whether Russia would cut off supplies, figures showed that March was the most expensive month for power prices in European history, analysts at Rystad Energy said on Thursday, breaking the record set in December for the big five European markets (Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain). Italy will end up with highest average prices, above €300 for the month of March. UK, France and Spain are not far behind, all close to €300, and then a sizable gap down to Germany around €250 and the Nordics around €140. President Joe Biden’s administration is considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day for several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to reduce gasoline prices, two senior US officials have said. Biden is expected to give remarks on Thursday on his administration’s actions, the White House said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions on Moscow have driven up the price of oil. The White House said Biden will deliver remarks at 1:30pm ET (5:30pm GMT) on “his administration’s actions to reduce the impact of Putin’s price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families.” It did not give additional details. The Biden administration is considering another release of oil from the SPR to help stabilise global energy markets that, if carried out, could be bigger than the sale of 30 million barrels earlier this month, a US source said on Friday. International Energy Agency member states agreed to release over 60 million barrels of oil reserves earlier in March, with 30 million barrels coming from the US SPR. The Biden administration is considering temporarily removing restrictions on summer sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends as a way to lower fuel costs for US consumers, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Adding more ethanol to gasoline blends could potentially reduce prices at US gas pumps because ethanol, which is made from corn, is currently cheaper than straight gasoline. Some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine provide a striking illustration of life for those living during war. Fire and smoke light up the night sky in a shade of bright orange, east of Kharkiv. Once-bustling city streets are seen deserted while a Russian missile lies in a children’s playground. Women nurse newborn babies in metro stations now being used as bomb shelters. Belarus will allow companies to export potash fertiliser in response to western sanctions, starting on 6 April 6, RIA news agency reported, citing a government decision. Belarus is the world’s third-largest producer of the crop nutrient after Canada and Russia and state-owned Belaruskali is one of the world’s largest players, according to Reuters. RIA said the Belarus government would grant export licenses to Belaruskali and the Belarus Potash Co (BPC). Washington has given BPC clients until 1 April to wind down their business with the firm. This month, the European Union tightened existing sanctions on Belarus to completely ban potash exports while conceding they could still be sent to Russia or third countries. Landlocked Belarus previously relied on shipments from the Baltic Sea port of Klaipeda in Lithuania. Vilnius halted the use of its railway for Belarus exports from 1 February. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on 21 March that the potash market would need to be discreet, like the arms trade, a local agency reported. The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, brings us this this analysis piece, asking: Why is Russia’s military regrouping and can Ukraine forces disrupt them? Russia’s announcement on Tuesday that it would “reduce military activity” around Kyiv and the nearby city of Chernihiv has been greeted with predictable scepticism, not least because shelling of both cities has continued. While some movement of troops from the north back to Belarus has been detected, these appear to be part of normal operational redeployments, and they do not yet definitively amount to a retreat. Ukraine’s general staff said overnight Russia was engaged in “probably a rotation of the separate units and aims at misleading”. If anything the shelling, with its consequences for civilians, is sadly to be expected: Russia will want to cover any halting of the ground offensive with firepower both to maintain uncertainty and keep Ukrainian forces tied down. And the capacity to bomb the city from a distance remains. Yet, it is obvious that Russia is, in the words of Konrad Muzyka, a military intelligence specialist and president of Rochan Consulting, “buying time” – as it seeks to refocus on the Donbas region and win a more conventional military victory in the east. The evident reality is that five weeks of near constant fighting north-west of the capital have utterly depleted Russia’s combat power. Across the board, Russian forces have suffered more than 10,000 casualties, the US now estimates – for a war that few of its troops expected or were properly prepared for. Read the full story below. Here’s a little more from Pentagon spokesman John Kirby’s briefing earlier. Kirby said the Pentagon agrees with assessments - mentioned earlier by White House director of communications Kate Bedingfield - that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not being fully informed about events in Ukraine. Kirby said the Pentagon saw this assessment as “disconcerting”. It’s his military. It’s his war. He chose it...the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting. Kirby also said that an uninformed Putin could result in a “less than faithful” effort at ending the conflict through negotiations. If he’s not fully informed of how poorly he’s doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement?” Kirby asked. Footage of the rescue effort to retrieve bodies from the ruins of the city of Irpin near Kyiv after a Russian attack has been released. The video shows the aftermath of weeks of fighting and Russian bombardment. A day after Russia promised to scale down operations near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, an intensified bombardment could be heard in the suburbs of the capital, near the areas retaken by Ukrainian forces in recent days. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said that Ukrainian forces had full control of the town, but asked residents not to return to the town and revealed that bodies were still trapped under rubble. Slovakia has said it will expel 35 Russian diplomats based on information provided by intelligence services. The move comes a day after fellow EU countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic all announced the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Other countries, including the United States and Poland, had earlier also expelled Russian diplomats. Slovakia will “reduce the staff of the Russian embassy in Bratislava by 35,” foreign ministry spokesman Juraj Tomaga told AFP. “We regret that following the previous expulsions of Russian diplomats in the last couple of years, the Russian diplomatic mission has not shown any interest in operating correctly in Slovakia,” he added. Slovakia, a member of the European Union, had already expelled three Russian diplomats for espionage earlier this month. Prime minister Eduard Heger showed his displeasure in a Facebook post headlined “Dasvidania,” or goodbye in Russian. My government will not tolerate having Russians in Slovakia, under diplomatic cover, leading massive espionage activities, corrupting our citizens, spreading disinformation and polarising our society.” Wrapping up his address, Zelenskiy had some stern words for “those who waste time and work only to stay in office” confirming he recalled the Ambassador of Ukraine in both Morocco and Georgia. “There are those who work together with everyone to defend the state. So that Ukraine can gain its future. We appreciate the work of each such person,” Zelenskiy said. “And there are those who waste time and work only to stay in office. Today I signed the first decree to recall such a person. Such an Ambassador of Ukraine. From Morocco. The Ambassador from Georgia was also recalled.” With all due respect: if there are no weapons, no sanctions, no restrictions for Russian business - please look for another job.” The diplomatic frontline is one of the key frontlines. And everyone there must work as efficiently as possible to win and help the army. Each on the diplomatic frontline must work just as each of our defenders on the battlefield.” Zelenskiy described another “very active diplomatic day” and outlined his three key priorities: weapons for Ukraine, new sanctions against Russia and financial support for his state. Referencing his call with US president Joe Biden, the Ukrainian leader said the conversation was “very detailed” and “lasted an hour”. Of course, I thanked the United States for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. And I stressed that right now is a turning point. I told President Biden what Ukraine needs. And I was as sincere as possible with him. The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world. Zelenskiy added: “Tanks, planes, artillery systems ... Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny.” He also referenced his earlier address to the Norwegian parliament, describing Norway as “one of the states that supported us significantly”. “I called for more help to Ukraine. With weapons and sanctions against Russia as well.” “I spoke today with the President of Egypt and the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates,” Zelenskiy added. Hello, it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Johana Bhuiyan signs off. Here’s a little more from Zelenskiy’s earlier address. Today I have few words, not much time, a lot of emotions and even more tasks. It is that kind of moment. A turning point, when we can and should talk only about the most important thing. Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics.” Zelenskiy spoke of the promise made by Russia to withdraw troops from the north of Ukraine. We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of exile. Consequences of the work of our defenders. But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this. We do not believe anyone – we do not trust any beautiful verbal constructions. There is a real situation on the battlefield. And now – this is the most important thing. We will not give up anything. And we will fight for every meter of our land, for every person.” Today so far... That’s it from me today; my colleague Samantha Lock will be taking over the blog. Here’s what happened so far: Russia and Ukraine will resume peace talks on 1 April: A senior Ukraine official said the peace talks would continue on 1 April online and that Ukraine had suggested the countries meet in person but Russia wanted the draft treaty to be farther along first. The head of Britain’s GCHQ spy service says some Russian soldiers are refusing to carry out orders: Citing new intelligence, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said intelligence showed that Russian soldiers were poorly equipped and had low morale leading to some refusing to carry out orders. Zelenskiy said peace talks continued with Russia but nothing was concrete: In a televised address to the nation, Zelenskiy said that peace talks continued “but for the moment there are just words, nothing concrete”. Global restrictions on exports to Russia have hit car and tank production: The global effort to sanction exports to Russia has forced a car maker to shut down and halted tank production. Putin has been misled over Russian military performance – US and EU: Putin has received misinformation about how well Russia is doing and how much the sanctions have affected the country because some of those closest to him are afraid to tell him the truth, US and European officials say. UK announces new laws targeting Russian oligarchs: The UK introduced new laws to “prevent Russian oligarch access to UK aviation and maritime technical services”, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The US will give Ukraine $500m in budget aid, Biden told Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy on Wednesday said peace talks have been ongoing but nothing “concrete” has come out of them. A senior Ukrainian official said Russia and Ukraine will resume those talks online on 1 April, Reuters is reporting. The Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said in an online post that Ukraine suggested the two countries should meet but that Russia said more work needed to be done on a draft treaty first. On Wednesday, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said that there’s new intelligence that shows some Russian soldiers in Ukraine have sabotaged their own equipment and accidentally shot down one of their own aircrafts, Reuters is reporting. “We’ve seen Russian soldiers short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” Fleming said in a speech in Canberra at the Australian National University. “Putin has massively misjudged the situation,” Fleming said. “We believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth.” Reuters was unable to independently confirm GCHQ’s analysis. Here’s more from the Reuters report: GCHQ, which gathers communications from around the world to identify and disrupt threats to Britain, has a close relationship with the U.S. National Security Agency and with the eavesdropping agencies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a consortium called “Five Eyes”. Russia’s defence ministry says its armed forces are professional and carrying out their duty in Ukraine with considerable success. It says the West has spread lies about the operation in an attempt to bring down Russia. The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60% for some of its precision-guided missiles, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters. Putin was misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Western sanctions have been, U.S. and European officials said on Wednesday. The Kremlin made no immediate comment. Putin says the “special military operation” in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to Ukraine on Wednesday that he doesn’t believe Russia’s vows to de-escalate its fighting, AFP is reporting. “We don’t believe anyone, not a single beautiful phrase,” he said. After Moscow said it would scale back its attacks around Kyiv and the northern city of Chernigiv, shelling reportedly continued through the night. However, Russian forces did begin to retreat from the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine has the right to demand weapons from the international community because it was the center for the global fight for freedom. “Freedom must be armed as well as tyranny,” he said. In a televised speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia continue “but for the moment there are just words, nothing concrete”, Reuters reported. Zelenskiy also said Ukraine was preparing for Russian attacks on Donbas. Global sanctions on exports to Russia have forced one car maker to shut down, stopped work on tanks, and cut off one computer maker’s access to necessary circuits, said Thea Kendler, assistant secretary for export administration at the Commerce Department. Reuters reported the announcement. “Necessity brought together this unprecedented collaboration on export controls and other measures that are having a meaningful impact on Putin’s war,” Kendler said. More from the Reuters report: While only about 5% of Russia’s imports came from the United States, Kendler said, adding the European Union and other coalition countries accounts for roughly 50 percent of Russia’s imports. Export controls were never expected to have immediate effects, she said, but noted the Ukrainian government reported that Russia’s two major tank plants halted work over a lack of foreign components. Baikal Electronics, a Russian semiconductor company and computer manufacturer, was cut off from integrated circuits to support its surveillance, servers, and other domestic communications equipment, she added. Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, exited the Russian market, cutting off the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies access to Elbrus chips, which are widely used in Russian intelligence and military systems, she said. Lada halted auto production as export controls deprived it of needed parts and supplies, she added. Renault, which controls the company that produces the Lada, said it would suspend operations at its plant in Moscow while it assesses options on its majority stake in Avtovaz AVAZI—p.MM, the country’s No. 1 carmaker. Renault did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did TSMC. Baikal Electronics, the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, and Russian tank maker UralVagonZavod could not immediately be reached for comment.” The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that the organization is unable to communicate with some of its employees in Mariupol. “Some managed to get out. Some are inside and we can’t communicate with them at this point. Those are my colleagues,” said the UNHCR’s High Commissioner Filippo Grandi in an interview with CNN. He also said in order to continue to evacuate refugees, as they did in Kharkiv last week, “we need firm commitments that there will be no fighting and we need a bit of time”. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that the warehouse that was damaged in Mariupol was a location they were distributing medical supplies to hospital from. However, the ICRC had not distributed supplies from that warehouse since 15 March because of the “intensity of the fighting and the absence of a functional agreement between the parties to allow for the safe passage of humanitarian assistance”. The ICRC said they are concerned that objects used for humanitarian relief are being targeted and called on the parties to “do everything in their power to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and protect civilians against the effects of attacks”. “But what we are most outraged by is the overall humanitarian situation in Mariupol and the relentless suffering inflicted on civilians living there,” the ICRC said in a statement. “People are trapped with no safe way out of the city, and they are running out of the very basics needed for their survival. This must change.” Over the last 24 hours, the first six of “around 30” shipments of US security assistance arrived in Ukraine, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said. “Material is getting into the region every single day, including over the last 24 hours,” Kirby said. According to CNN, Kirby said the US is prioritizing “the kinds of material that we know the Ukrainians need the most”, including anti-armor and anti-air systems. He also said the Switchblade drones promised to Ukraine will begin shipping in “relatively soon”. Hi there, Johana here taking over from my colleague Gloria. Less than 20% of Russian forces that are stationed around Kyiv are being repositioned, according to the Pentagon. But they are unlikely to head home and are instead expected to be resupplied and redeployed, Reuters is reporting. Some of them may have already moved into Belarus, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, and Russian contractor Wagner Group has also deployed about 1,000 contractors into Ukraine’s Donbas region. Russian forces are starting to withdraw from the Chernobyl nuclear site, reports AFP citing the US Pentagon. A senior US official said that Russian troops are “walking away” from the facility and going into Belarus. The US is looking at options to expand sanctions imposed on Russia and will provide further updates in the coming days, reports Reuters. Speaking at the daily White House briefing, [White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield] said President Joe Biden is continuing to look at options to expand sanctions and will have more information in coming days. Biden has imposed a wide variety of economic penalties aimed at punishing Russia. More on air strike in the Ukraine city of Dnipro: a Ukrainian official confirmed that an oil depot was hit in the attack with no casualties reported. Russian hackers attempted to penetrate the network of Nato and militaries in some eastern European countries, reports Reuters. Russian hackers have recently attempted to penetrate the networks of NATO and the militaries of some eastern European countries, Google’s Threat Analysis Group said in a report published on Wednesday. The report did not say which militaries had been targeted in what Google described as “credential phishing campaigns” launched by a Russian-based group called Coldriver, or Callisto. “These campaigns were sent using newly created Gmail accounts to non-Google accounts, so the success rate of these campaigns is unknown,” the report said. NATO was not immediately available for comment on the report. Russia, which is now under heavy Western economic sanctions following its decision to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24, regularly denies accusations of mounting cyber attacks on Western targets. In 2019, Finnish cybersecurity firm F-Secure Labs described Callisto as an unidentified and advanced threat actor “interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy” in Europe. The group also targeted a NATO Centre of Excellence, Wednesday’s Google report said, without elaborating. In a statement, the centre did not directly address Google’s report but said: “We see malicious cyber activity on a daily basis.” Putin is being misled about the Russian military’s performance in Ukraine, said several US and EU officials today. Kate Bedingfield, director of communications at the White House, told reporters on Wednesday: “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership.” “We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.” She added: “So, it is increasingly clear that Putin’s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage.” A senior EU diplomat seconded Bedingfield’s point, saying that the US assessment was in line with Europe’s thinking, reported Reuters. “Putin thought things were going better than they were. That’s the problem with surrounding yourself with ‘yes men’ or only sitting with them at the end of a very long table,” the diplomat said. Russian troops were being told that they were taking part in a military exercise prior to the Ukraine invasion, but had to sign a document that extended their duties, said two European diplomats to Reuters. “They were misled, badly trained and then arrived to find old Ukrainian women who looked like their grandmothers yelling at them to go home,” added one of the diplomats. There are no signs at the moment that the situation could foster a revolt within the Russian military, but the situation is “unpredictable” and Western powers “would hope that unhappy people would speak up,” said the senior European diplomat to Reuters. The majority of Americans support sending more troops to Nato allies in Europe amid the Ukraine invasion, reports Reuters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed yesterday, 55% of bipartisan Americans agree with sending additional forces to Nato allies in the region. Additional polls have found that about 61% of Democrats support additional troop deployment compared to 41% of Republicans. Yesterday, the US Pentagon announced that more troops and military equipment will be sent to Nato allies in Europe, with 200 additional personnel heading to eastern Europe, including Lithuania. No troops will be sent into Ukraine, consistent with earlier remarks Biden made about no US forces being into the country. There are currently more than 100,000 troops in Europe versus 80,000 prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Ukraine city of Dnipro has experienced another missile strike, according to several online reports. From the Kyiv Independent: Dnipro suffers a missile strike. Authorities are not yet revealing what was targeted. Dnipro, a city of 1 million people in central Ukraine, has seen only a couple of missile strikes before, including one that severely damaged its airport. Dnipro mayor Boris Filatov posted about the strike on Facebook, adding that he was waiting for an official message from Ukraine’s military administration before providing additional comments. Earlier today, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said that sanctions against Russia should increase until Russia’s full withdrawal from Ukraine, reports AFP. During a hearing in parliament today, Johnson said that lifting G7 sanctions in the case of a Russian ceasefire would play “straight into [Vladimir] Putin’s playbook.” Johnson added: “My view is we should intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine,” noting that the UK government was looking at “going up a gear” in its military aid to Ukraine. Johnson ruled out giving Ukraine the equivalence of Nato Article 5 status, which deems that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Instead, Johnson said that Ukraine would benefit from the security concept “based on the idea of deterrence by denial.” The US Department of Commerce today identified additional airplanes that had recently flown to Russia in possible violation of US export controls, reported Reuters. The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday added 73 airplanes that have recently flown to Russia to a list of aircraft believed to violate U.S. export controls as part of the Biden administration’s sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have not advanced says France foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian today, reported Reuters. In an interview with France24, Le Drian said that there are no signs that Russia has changed its position. Here is a clip from Le Drian’s interview where he talks about the need for a ceasefire in Mariupol amid ongoing fighting in the besieged city. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Russia has been accused of intensifying its bombardment of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv despite claims the Kremlin would drawback out of respect for ongoing peace talks. Vladyslav Atroshenko, Chernihiv’s mayor, said the Russians had lied and that they were continuing to heavily hit his city. “They’re saying reducing intensity, they actually have increased the intensity of strikes,” he told CNN. There was also continued barraging of Kyiv’s suburbs, Ukrainian officials said, said although a defence ministry spokesperson said there were some signs of troop movements away from the two cities. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces were regrouping near Kyiv and Chernihiv in order to focus on other key areas and complete the “liberation” of the breakaway Donbas region, Russian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military said Russian troops were also intensifying their attacks around the eastern city of Izyum and the eastern Donetsk region, after redeploying some units from other areas. The regional Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces are shelling nearly all cities along the frontline separating Ukrainian government-controlled territory from the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk in the east. Russian forces struck a Red Cross facility in the besieged southern Ukraine port city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said. An International Red Cross (ICRC) spokesperson confirmed an image being circulated showed an ICRC warehouse in Mariupol, but that they could not provide any other information. Vladimir Putin told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Russian shelling of Mariupol will end only when Ukrainian troops surrender, the Kremlin said. French officials said Putin had agreed to consider plans to evacuate citizens out of the southern Ukrainian city, but the Russian government said Putin had insisted to Macron that Ukrainian “nationalist militants” must surrender. An estimated 200-300 civilians were killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin near Kyiv before the town was taken back from Russian forces this week, the local mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, said. About 50 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed in Irpin, and some bodies were still trapped under rubble, he said, adding that there had been Russian shelling in the area all night. The Kremlin played down hopes of an early breakthrough a day after peace talks in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine. “We cannot state that there was anything too promising or any breakthroughs,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said. He said it was “positive” that Kyiv had outlined its demands but there was “a lot of work to be done”. More than 4 million people have fled Russia’s “utterly senseless” war on Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, the UN refugee agency said. The figure surpasses the UN’s initial estimate that the war would create up to 4 million refugees. More than 90% are women and children. The United States will provide $500m (£380m) in budgetary assistance to Ukraine, President Joe Biden told Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a call today. The two leaders spoke over the phone for nearly an hour about the ongoing efforts by the US and its allies to provide military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House readout. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed China as part of a new “just, democratic world order” ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. In his first visit to China since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Lavrov said the world was “living through a very serious stage in the history of international relations”. Wang said Beijing and Moscow are “more determined” to develop bilateral ties and boost cooperation and reaffirmed China’s support for continued peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Putin’s approval ratings surged in March to levels not seen in five years as the war in Ukraine enters its second month, according to an independent survey. According to the Levada Center, Putin’s job approval grew to 83% in March from 71% in February. The last time Putin reached similar approval ratings was in 2017. The UK has granted only 2,700 visas under its much-advertised Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme more than two weeks after its launch, according to Home Office figures. Meanwhile, Ukrainian refugees in Poland told the Guardian that they were baffled by the UK government’s asylum rules, which they say appear designed more to keep people out than offer shelter to those fleeing war. The UK has introduced new laws which aim to “prevent Russian oligarch access to UK aviation and maritime technical services”, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. The new laws will prohibit the maintenance of aircraft or ships belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs or their businesses, the department said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today as I hand over the blog to my US colleague, Gloria Oladipo. Thank you for reading. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s Chechen republic, said Moscow would make no concessions in its war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. In a statement that appeared to deviate from Russia’s official position, Kadyrov said the Russian negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, had been wrong to suggest otherwise. Vladimir Putin would not just stop what he had started in Ukraine, Kadyrov warned. Ukrainian cities have been pounded by airstrikes and heavy shelling in Russia’s five-week-old invasion, killing civilians and destroying hospitals in acts that may amount to war crimes, the top UN human rights official has said. Michelle Bachelet, addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, called on Russia to withdraw its troops. She also said her office had received “credible allegations” that Russian forces had used cluster munitions in populated areas of Ukraine at least 24 times. “Homes and administrative buildings, hospitals and schools, water stations and electricity systems have not been spared,” she said. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special operation” to disarm and “denazify” its neighbour. Bachelet said that her office, which deploys nearly 60 UN human rights monitors in Ukraine, had verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities were damaged, including 50 hospitals. “Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” she said. “The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to,” Bachelet said, referring to the rules of war embodied in the Geneva conventions. The UK has introduced new laws which aim to “prevent Russian oligarch access to UK aviation and maritime technical services”, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. The new laws will prohibit the maintenance of aircraft or ships belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs or their businesses, the department said in a statement. The FCDO said the new powers had been used immediately to sanction Russian businessmen Eugene Shvidler and Oleg Tinkov. Meanwhile, the finance, trade and shipping sanctions imposed on Crimea have been expanded to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: There is no doubt that (Vladimir) Putin and his elite have been surprised by the strength of our sanctions. We will continue to ramp up the pressure so long as Russian troops are in Ukraine, targeting not only the businesses of oligarchs but also their assets and international lifestyles. Transport secretary Grant Shapps added: Our economic and transport sanctions are working to suffocate those most complicit in Putin’s regime ensuring that no one on UK soil can support Putin’s inhuman assault in Ukraine. The United States will provide $500m (£380m) in budgetary assistance to Ukraine, President Joe Biden told Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a call today. The two leaders spoke over the phone for nearly an hour about the ongoing efforts by the US and its allies to provide military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House readout. A White House statement read: The leaders discussed how the United States is working around the clock to fulfill the main security assistance requests by Ukraine, the critical effects those weapons have had on the conflict, and continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country. In addition, President Biden informed President Zelenskyy that the United States intends to provide the Ukrainian government with $500 million in direct budgetary aid. He also reviewed the additional sanctions and humanitarian assistance announced last week. President Zelenskyy updated President Biden on the status of Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he spoke with Biden about “specific defensive support” and “a new package of enhanced sanctions”. It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Russia has been accused of intensifying its bombardment of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv despite claims the Kremlin would drawback out of respect for ongoing peace talks.

Vladimir Putin’s advisers are “too afraid to tell him the truth” about how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Westerns sanctions have been to Russia’s economy, according to a US official. Reuters quoted the official as saying the US believes Putin “is being misinformed” by his advisers. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed China as part of a new “just, democratic world order” ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.

Russian president Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings surged in March to levels not seen in five years as the war in Ukraine enters its second month, according to an independent survey published Wednesday. According to the Levada Center, which is Russia’s main independent pollster, Putin’s job approval grew to 83% in March from 71% in February. The last time Putin reached similar approval ratings was in 2017, prior to the introduction of an unpopular pension reform that raised the country’s retirement age. The past month also saw increases in Russians’ trust for the country’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and the country’s ruling party United Russia, the pollster said. The share of those who said Russia is moving in the right direction has also grown to 69%, a jump of 17% from the month before. Independent sociologists have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television which has portrayed the country’s invasion of Ukraine as a defensive “special military operation” aimed at “de-nazifying” Kyiv. Sociologists have also said respondents in the country could be afraid to tell pollsters they are opposed to the war. Russia’s parliament earlier this month passed a far-reaching law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Still, the latest Levada polling appears to indicate that the Kremlin has so far managed to galvanize support for its invasion of the country. The Levada Centre has not released a poll of public opinion specifically on the war since the conflict began. Plans to publish results of an earlier poll were scrapped by the centre’s employees because of concerns that their results would promote the intensification of the conflict. State-run opinion polls have indicated that around 70% support the country’s actions in Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has promoted Ramzan Kadyrov to lieutenant-general for his role in the invasion of Ukraine, which the Chechen leader is using to showcase his loyalty to Moscow and his own impunity, Emma Graham-Harrison and Vera Mironova report. This week Kadyrov claimed that a key ally linked to the 2015 murder of the Russian opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov, was injured fighting in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Rustam Geremeev was pictured in hospital, where Kadyrov visited him. Earlier videos the Chechen leader posted calling Geremeev a “dear brother” claimed to show him on the frontlines in Mariupol, including at the city hall. Nemtsov’s family have long insisted that Geremeev was a mastermind of the murder plot. Five Chechen men were found guilty of the killing in 2017, but the trial was denounced by relatives and allies as a cover-up that failed to bring those behind the assassination to justice. Investigators told the 2017 trial that they visited Geremeev’s property in Chechnya but “no one opened the door”. They also named Geremeev’s driver, Ruslan Mukhudinov, as an organiser of the killing and said he offered the suspects millions of roubles for the murder. Mukhudinov has since fled and investigators said after the verdict that the case against him was ongoing. Geremeev, who is a relative of two Russian MPs, served in the same paramilitary security unit as Zaur Dadaev, a former senior officer convicted of shooting Nemtsov. The unit has close ties to Kadyrov, though he has never been directly linked to the murder. Geremeev’s appearance on the frontlines in Mariupol is a show of both Kadyrov’s strength and his allies’ apparent ability to defy Russian law. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces were regrouping near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv in order to focus on other key areas and complete the “liberation” of the breakaway Donbas region, Russian news agencies reported. The announcement comes after it said it would drastically scale back military operations near Kyiv and Chernihiv. The Pentagon press secretary John Kirby later said the US believed the strategy chance was “a repositioning, not a real withdrawal”. Moscow has said its main focus is now on Donbas. Last week, top Russian military officials said Russia was entering a “new phase” focused on “liberating” the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been waging a low-level insurgency for eight years. The UK’s goal is not to remove the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from power, Boris Johnson told the Commons liaison committee this afternoon. Johnson said he understood why the US president, Joe Biden, had said Putin “cannot remain in power” in a speech at the weekend, but that was “not the objective of the UK government”. Johnson told MPs: It’s not the objective of the UK government and it’s very, very important everybody gets this, we are simply setting out to help to protect the people of Ukraine and to protect them against absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence. Asked whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had been speaking to Putin for “too long”, the PM replied that “Putin is plainly not to be trusted”. He said efforts from the west to fight disinformation are “starting to have an effect”, with signs in Russia of “people waking up to what’s going on”, adding: One of the depressing things is the ruthlessness with which Putin tries to conceal the reality of what’s happening from the Russian population – and genuinely, you can ring and talk to Russian friends and they will seriously dispute what is going on in Ukraine. I’m afraid people are very vulnerable to the lies that Putin is telling and we have to be extremely energetic in exposing them. For more live updates from Johnson’s appearance before the liaison committee, head over to our UK politics live blog with Andrew Sparrow. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russian forces in Ukraine are regrouping and preparing for renewed offensive operations, Reuters reports. Russia’s main efforts are focused on surrounding Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine, defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, said. Russian forces are still trying to take the besieged southern port city of Mariupol and the towns of Popasna and Rubizhne in Luhansk, he added. Ukraine had observed some movements of Russian forces away from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions but did not consider this to be a mass withdrawal, he said. In a call with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday night, Vladimir Putin said Russian shelling of Mariupol will end only when Ukrainian troops surrender, the Kremlin said. According to French officials, Putin had agreed to consider plans to evacuate citizens out of the southern Ukrainian city which the Élysée Palace said had become a “catastrophic” situation. A statement from the French government read: Civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid, water and the medicines they need. This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces. France, along with Turkey and Greece and several humanitarian groups, have presented the Russian president with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said Putin told Macron that he would “think about” the proposal. However, in its readout of the call, the Kremlin said Putin had insisted to Macron that Ukrainian “nationalist militants” must surrender. According to the Kremlin, Putin said: In order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city, Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms. The statement added that Putin had given Macron “detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation” of civilians from Mariupol. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, spoke with the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Kuleba tweeted that the EU’s fifth round of sanctions against Russia “must come as soon as possible and be as tough as possible”. However, Borrell’s tweet following the conversation made no mention of another round of sanctions, only stating that the EU will “maintain the pressure” on Russia. Vladimir Putin’s advisers are “too afraid to tell him the truth” about how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Westerns sanctions have been to Russia’s economy, according to a US official. Reuters quotes the official, speaking on condition of anonymity: We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisors are too afraid to tell him the truth. Ukrainian refugees in Poland are frustrated and confused by British asylum rules, which they say appear designed more to keep people out than offer shelter to those fleeing war. Refugees arriving at Warsaw central station told the Guardian that they were baffled by the UK government’s rules requiring them to find a sponsor in Britain before they could apply for a visa, which could take weeks to be processed. None said they knew anyone in the UK who could sponsor them. “I think it’s very complicated,” said Katerina Ilasova, who fled her home city of Poltava after the invasion started. “I’ve heard lots of positive things about Britain. But for me it is too complex. So people are signing up to go to other countries that are easier to get to.” Ivan Yakovlev, who left Dnipro before the war started to work in Georgia, wanted to get to Britain because of the language. “I speak English, my wife speaks English; it will be good for us, simpler to find a job there. But I don’t know what we should do; I don’t have any connections.” A small team of British people has set up a stall inside Warsaw station to explain the rules to refugees and advise them on how to apply. They have had a handful of successes matching Ukrainians with British sponsors, but their efforts have been dwarfed by those of a Spanish group at a neighbouring stall, who have helped more than 1,000 Ukrainians start their journey to Spain, arranging free transport and hosts at the other end. “The bottleneck is in the visa system and the matching of refugees with hosts,” said Ed Pinkney, a British Hong Kong-based researcher who has been volunteering at the station for two weeks. “I’m getting frustrated because it’s wasting time that could have been given to the immediate needs of Ukrainians,” he said. “The logical thing to do would be to get them to the UK and do any checks there.” Some hopefuls do get lucky. Alyona Vinohradova was fortunate to bump into Terri Shanks, a woman from Berkshire who was in Poland for business. Shanks has offered to host Vinohradova, her husband and their 11-year-old daughter, Kamila, once the family’s application has been processed and their visa approved. “I don’t know why we can’t bring them in on a tourist visa,” says Shanks. “The Spanish are scooping them up and worrying about the paperwork later. We don’t seem to be doing that. It’s ridiculous when there’s a home waiting.” “I think it’s very complex,” said Vinohradova. “I think the UK is ensuring that all the Ukrainians don’t come.” An estimated 200-300 civilians were killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin near Kyiv before the town was taken back from Russian forces this week, the local mayor has said. Reuters report that mayor Oleksandr Markushyn told a briefing on Wednesday that about 50 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed in Irpin, and some bodies were still trapped under rubble. He said there had been Russian shelling in the area all night. More than 4 million people have fled Russia’s “utterly senseless” war on Ukraine, the United Nations has said, as the Kremlin played down hopes of an early breakthrough a day after peace talks between the two sides. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said 4,019,287 people had fled abroad since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, surpassing the agency’s initial estimate that the war would create up to 4 million refugees. More than 90% are women and children. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Twitter he had just arrived in Ukraine and was beginning discussions with authorities, the UN and other partners on “ways to increase our support to people affected and displaced by this senseless war”. The agency has said the speed and scale of the displacement was unprecedented in Europe since the second world war. The UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that as of mid-March, 6.48 million people were also internally displaced. “They need urgent, life-saving aid,” the organisation said on Wednesday. Before the war, Ukraine had a population of 37 million in the regions under government control, excluding Crimea and the Russian-controlled regions in the east.

An International Red Cross spokesperson has confirmed to the Guardian: We can confirm that the image being circulated shows the ICRC warehouse in Mariupol. We do not have a team on the ground in Mariupol so we have no other information, including on potential casualties or damage. We can say that we had already distributed all aid supplies in the warehouse. After the Ukraine invasion, hundreds of people found themselves stranded in Calais as they tried to navigate the UK visa process. It put a spotlight on the city where many young refugees have been living outside all winter in harsh conditions, while NGOs struggled to provide the most basic services. The UK has given millions of pounds to France to try to prevent border crossings but people continue to attempt to get to Britain. Meanwhile, the residents of Calais complain of an increasingly militarised city. The Guardian’s Maeve Shearlaw and Christopher Cherry have this video report. It is Martin Belam back here for an hour while Léonie takes a break. You can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russian forces struck a Red Cross facility in the besieged southern Ukraine port city of Mariupol, according to Ukrainian ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova. In a statement on social media, she said: In Mariupol, the occupiers aimed at the building of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Enemy aircraft and artillery fired on a building marked with a red cross on a white background, indicating the presence of wounded, civilian or humanitarian cargo. Denisova did not specify when the strikes had taken place and said there was no confirmation yet about casualties. Her statement continued: This is another war crime of the Russian army in accordance with the Rome statute of the international criminal court and a gross violation of the 1949 Geneva conventions. Until now, the only ones who shelled buildings and vehicles marked with red crosses were the troops of Hitler’s Germany. I call on the world community to condemn the barbaric actions of the occupying country in shelling the ICRC building and to take measures to end the bloody war on the territory of Ukraine as soon as possible. Note: the Guardian has not yet been able to independently verify her statement. A Nasa astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a US record 355 days at the International Space Station, returning with two cosmonauts to a world torn apart by war. Mark Vande Hei landed in a Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan alongside the Russian Space Agency’s Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, who also spent the past year in space. Despite escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Vladimir Putin’s war with Ukraine, Vande Hei’s return followed customary procedures. A small Nasa team of doctors and other staff was on hand for the touchdown and planned to return immediately to Houston with the 55-year-old astronaut. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vande Hei said he was avoiding the subject with his two Russian crewmates. Despite getting along “fantastically … I’m not sure we really want to go there“, he said. It was the first taste of gravity for Vande Hei and Dubrov since their Soyuz launch on 9 April last year. Shkaplerov joined them at the orbiting lab in October, escorting a Russian film crew up for a brief stay. To accommodate that visit, Vande Hei and Dubrov doubled the length of their stay. Before departing the space station, Shkaplerov embraced his fellow astronauts as “my space brothers and space sister”. “People have problem on Earth. On orbit … we are one crew,” Shkaplerov said in a live Nasa TV broadcast on Tuesday. The space station is a symbol of “friendship and cooperation and … future of exploration of space”. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russian forces are continuing their attacks on the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, despite the Kremlin’s claims that it would halt attacks there and in Kyiv out of respect for ongoing peace talks. Ukraine has seen some troop movements from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas, but no mass scale withdrawal, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said. From my colleague Shaun Walker: China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Beijing and Moscow are “more determined” to develop bilateral ties and boost cooperation, following a meeting in China with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Reuters reports. Wang said bilateral ties had withstood new tests amid the changing international situation but had maintained the “correct” direction of development He also reaffirmed China’s support for continued peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The governor of Chernihiv in Ukraine has said he saw no let-up in Russian attacks despite a promise by Moscow to scale down military operations there. Governor Viacheslav Chaus said of Russia’s pledge: Do we believe in it? Of course not. He said all-night strikes on Nizhyn and Chernihiv included residential buildings, libraries and shopping centres. With each rocket, Vladimir Putin was putting ‘another nail’ in his coffin, he added. The Chernihiv governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia had continued to attack the northern Ukrainian city this morning, despite Moscow’s promise to drastically scale back military activities in the area. Speaking to the BBC, Chaus said: Right now, as we speak, I can hear which I think are mortar shells. Chernihiv and the town of Nizhyn were attacked during the night and civilian buildings were destroyed, he said. We don’t believe [the Russians] because we’ve already seen that there isn’t a single time when their military forces keep their word. His words came as the city’s mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said Russian attacks on Chernihiv had actually increased since Russia’s claim to reduce operations. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed China as part of a new world order ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. In his first visit to China since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Lavrov said the world was “living through a very serious stage in the history of international relations”, AFP reports. In a video released by the Russian foreign ministry ahead of his meeting, Lavrov said: We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order. Lavrov and Wang were later photographed in face masks bumping elbows in front of their national flags. China has not published a readout of the two ministers, but foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin later told reporters that Moscow and Beijing will continue efforts in “advancing global multipolarity and the democratisation of international relations”. Repeating a line used by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to characterise ties, Wang added: Our striving for peace has no limits, our upholding of security has no limits, our opposition towards hegemony has no limits. The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said the northern Ukrainian city has been under “colossal attack” despite a promise by Moscow to scale down military operations there. In an interview with CNN, Atroshenko hit out at Russia’s claim that it planned to “drastically reduce” its military assault on Chernihiv and the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Atroshenko said: This is yet another confirmation that Russia always lies. Contrary to Russia’s statement that it would de-escalate attacks, Atroshenko said hostilities have increased in Chernihiv since the claim was made. They’re saying reducing intensity, they actually have increased the intensity of strikes. Today we have a colossal attack on the center of Chernihiv. Twenty-five people have been wounded and are now in hospitals. They’re all civilians. So whenever Russia says something, this needs to be checked carefully. The UK has granted only 2,700 visas under its much advertised Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme more than two weeks after its launch, according to Home Office figures released on Wednesday. The department also released updated figures about the number of people who have been granted visas to come to stay with British relatives. The Ukraine Family scheme, which has been running since the start of March, has issued 22,800 visas. More than 3.9 million refugees have left Ukraine, with the vast majority of them settling in Poland, according to the UNHCR. An estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Dozens of people who hoped to bring refugees to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have contacted the Guardian to express frustration at the slowness of the visa granting system. More than 150,000 people signed up to express interest in hosting refugees. Applicants have complained that there is no way to track applications, leaving refugees uncertain about whether to begin travelling to the UK, or to remain in Ukraine. Some people have complained that the online form is badly designed, contains glitches and is difficult to complete if English is not your first language. Others have struggled with the amount of documentation needed, questioning whether it is realistic for people fleeing war zones to have brought bank statements, or other documentary evidence proving they were resident in Ukraine. Some people have reported that some family members have been granted visas while others have not, leaving them with difficult decisions about whether to split families as they try to seek safety. Numerous potential hosts have contacted the Guardian describing their fears for the safety of refugees they are hoping to host, who are waiting, often in unsuitable accommodation, for visas to be granted. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, speaking with reporters today, said Russia had not noticed anything really promising or that looked like a breakthrough yet in peace talks with Ukraine, Reuters is reporting. Moscow welcomed the fact that Kyiv has set out its demands in written form, he said, but he said there was a long period of work ahead. Ukraine negotiators said yesterday that they proposed adopting neutral status for security guarantees at talks with Russia in Istanbul, meaning Ukraine would not join military alliances or host military bases. The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the guarantee, similar to Nato’s article 5 which commits alliance members to defend one another, would involve countries such as the US, UK, Turkey, France and Germany being “legally actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression”. The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators told reporters following talks in Turkey. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine today. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian shells have bombarded the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv overnight, its mayor has said, hours after the Kremlin claimed it would halt attacks there and in Kyiv out of respect for ongoing peace talks. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the talks had been “positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”, adding that Ukraine had no intention of reducing its military efforts. Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “not naive people” and he saw “no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction”. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia is moving forces from northern to eastern Ukraine to try to encircle Ukrainian troops. The regional Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said Russian forces are shelling nearly all cities along the frontline separating Ukrainian government-controlled territory from the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk in the east. Moscow’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations does not represent a ceasefire. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there is still “a long way to go” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said there is still a danger of ammunition exploding at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station, and demanded “the UN security council immediately take measures to demilitarise the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe.” She also said Ukraine had asked Russia at talks in Istanbul yesterday to allow 97 humanitarian corridors to be established to the worst-hit towns, cities, and villages in Ukraine. Three have been set up for today. The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has said 4.02 million people have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. More than 2.3 million of the Ukrainians who have fled abroad are now in Poland. On top of the 4 million refugees, an estimated 6.5 million people are internally displaced within the country. The British government said on Wednesday it had issued 25,500 visas to Ukrainians under schemes set up to bring in refugees. Just 2,700 places have been offered on the sponsorship scheme, despite more than 150,000 British people expressing an interest in offering a home. The United Nations has named three human rights experts to conduct an investigation into possible war crimes and other violations committed during the conflict in Ukraine. The independent panel will be led by Erik Mose, a Norwegian judge who was president of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda from 2003 to 2007. China and Russia have agreed “wider co-operation” after a meeting of Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui. Germany has declared an “early warning” that it could be heading for a gas supply emergency and said the measure was aimed at preparing for a possible disruption of natural gas flows from Russia. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. The United Nations has named three human rights experts to conduct an investigation into possible war crimes and other violations committed during the conflict in Ukraine. The independent panel, to be led by Erik Mose of Norway, has a mandate to “investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation”, a statement said. Mose, who is 71, is a Norwegian judge who was president of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda from 2003 to 2007. Reuters notes that the UN human rights council agreed on 4 March to establish the commission of inquiry, for one year, at the request of Ukraine and allies including the European Union, Britain and the US. A quick snap about a U-turn from Reuters here: Finland’s national railway operator VR Group said it would resume services between Helsinki and St Petersburg in Russia today, less than a week after having halted the service. The operator had halted the service as a result of sanctions, but now understands they do not apply. The British government said on Wednesday it had issued 25,500 visas to Ukrainians under schemes set up to bring in refugees after Russia invaded Ukraine last month. UNHCR states that more than 4 million Ukrainians have fled abroad in the last five weeks. Reuters report that data from the Home Office showed that 22,800 visas had been given under the Ukraine family scheme, with 2,700 being offered under the sponsorship scheme. That second figure of 2,700 comes despite the fact that over 150,000 British people have expressed an interest in housing someone fleeing Ukraine. The ministry of internal affairs of Ukraine have just posted some images of the damage to Lysychansk. They say: “We have significant destruction of residential high-rise buildings. There are probably people under the rubble.” The city is in the Luhansk Oblast in the east of the country. One of those 4 million refugees from Ukraine was a small girl in Rome today, who was blessed at the Vatican by Pope Francis. The head of the UN’s population agency has said she is “extremely concerned” about the potential for the war to cause a rise in unintended pregnancies, as concerns mount over sexual violence targeting women both in and outside Ukraine. “Apart from the inability to provide women with services that they need, such as their regular contraceptive services, there is also the question of coercion, which is very bound up with women and girls who are vulnerable. So the fears of trafficking [of female refugees], the fears of being displaced, linking to sexual violence is a preoccupation that we have,” said Natalia Kanem, executive director of UNFPA. Kanem was speaking at the launch of UNFPA’s annual report, which showed that nearly half of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended. While data relating to Ukraine is hard to come by for now, research into previous humanitarian emergencies has found that more than 20% of refugee and internally displaced women say they have experienced sexual violence. “And I would have to bet that that is an under-reporting because there’s so much stigma around the issue,” added Kanem. Giulia Vallese, UNFPA’s regional director for eastern Europe, said that although the UN had not been able to independently verify reports of rape and sexual violence inside Ukraine, “this doesn’t necessarily mean that it hasn’t happened. We know very well that conflicts around the world have been accompanied by sexual violence. And we have to be very, very clear that every case of rape is one case too many, even though it might be difficult to quantify them.” Last week, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the authorities were investigating an alleged rape of a woman by a Russian soldier in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. Dmitri Peskov, spokesman for the Kremlin, said the allegation was “a lie”. “We don’t believe it at all,” he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Maria Mezentseva, a Ukrainian MP, said there were “many more victims” of sexual assault. “We will definitely not be silent,” she added. • This post was amended on 1 April 2022 to clarify that the reference to 20% of refugee and displaced women reporting sexual violence related to research into humanitarian emergencies in general, not to the war in Ukraine. The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has said that 4.02 million people have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. With a pre-invasion population of about 44 million, that equates to roughly one in every 11 Ukrainian people having crossed the border in the space of around five weeks. On top of the 4 million refugees, an estimated 6.5 million people are internally displaced within the country. More than 2.3 million of the Ukrainians who have fled abroad are now in Poland. My colleague Daniel Boffey is in Lviv, and sends this report on overnight events in the north of Ukraine: Russian shells have bombarded the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv overnight, its mayor has said, hours after the Kremlin claimed it would halt attacks there and in Kyiv out of respect for ongoing peace talks. Vladyslav Atroshenko said the Russians had lied and were continuing to indiscriminately attack the encircled city, which is less than 100 miles north of the country’s capital. Authorities in Chernihiv estimate that about 400 people have died since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February, with civilians living now without electricity, gas or water. Atroshenko said: “The night was just as we expected, that [everything Russia promised] is a lie from the beginning till the end, that’s why at night we had some serious shelling at night. And the Russians were trying to destroy all possible means of crossing Desna River towards Kyiv.” Atroshenko, who has called for Kyiv not to swap captured pilots who had operated above Chernihiv for Ukrainian prisoners of war, said there had been no evidence of any withdrawal over the last 24 hours from around his city. He said: “The locals live in a real humanitarian crisis for weeks with no electricity, no heating, no water, only in some areas of the city there’s gas [natural gas, not petrol]. Thousands of buildings are destroyed. Yesterday, our district, Liotka, was shelled especially heavily, where a few people died and dozens were injured. “Have you ever met liars in your life? What stands behind their lies? They are just liars. They lie all the time!” Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report from Lviv: Russia bombards Chernihiv hours after pledging to halt shelling Russia is moving forces from northern to eastern Ukraine to try to encircle Ukrainian troops, but is keeping some behind near the capital, Kyiv, to tie down part of the Ukrainian military there, a presidential adviser said on national television. Oleksiy Arestovych also said Ukraine had improved its negotiating position since before the start of the Russian invasion, pushing to secure neutral status but with external security guarantees. He also said, Reuters reports, that the war will still be in the active phase for a week. Here are some of the latest pictures to be sent back to us from Ukraine on the newswires: Two more points that have come out of UK deputy prime minister Dominic Raab’s media appearances today. He said UK sanctions against Russia will remain in place until the invasion of Ukraine is “withdrawn”. “The sanctions are there to tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine,” PA Media quotes him telling the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Until the invasion is withdrawn – and I think that would need to be either entirely or verifiably – I don’t think the sanctions can or should be lifted.” Raab was cautious about the prospect of the UK acting as an independent guarantor of Ukraine’s security if it declared itself to be neutral as part of a peace deal with Moscow. “It would depend on what precisely is involved. We have been very clear we are not going to engage Russia in direct military confrontation. Ukraine is not a Nato member,” he said. “We will consider anything that President Zelenskiy says he needs very carefully. But we are not going to, I think, replicate unilaterally the Nato commitments that apply to Nato members.” Poland plans to stop using Russian oil by the end of 2022 and to stop importing Russian coal by May at the latest, the prime minister said on Wednesday, as it cuts economic ties with Moscow due to the war in Ukraine. “We will impose a total embargo on Russian coal, and I hope that by April, May at the latest, we will have completely exited from Russian coal,” Reuters quotes Mateusz Morawiecki telling a news conference. “We will do everything to stop using Russian oil by the end of this year.” The regional Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has said on national television in Ukraine that Russian forces are shelling nearly all cities along the frontline separating Ukrainian government-controlled territory from the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. Reuters reports he warned that the situation could worsen as Russian forces concentrated their efforts to attack in that region. The governor of Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region said he saw no let-up in Russian attacks despite a promise by Moscow to scale down military operations there. Of Russia’s statement that they would de-escalate attacks, Reuters reports he said “Do we believe in it? Of course not.” Governor Viacheslav Chaus said on the Telegram messaging app “The ‘decreased activity’ in the Chernihiv region was demonstrated by the enemy carrying out strikes on Nizhyn, including airstrikes, and all night long they hit Chernihiv.” Chernihiv Oblast is the region of Ukraine directly to the north-east of the capital, Kyiv. The Interfax news agency and Reuters have some news of that meeting between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui. The two countries have agreed to widen cooperation in what Moscow described as “difficult international conditions”. Germany has declared an “early warning” that it could be heading for a gas supply emergency and said the measure was aimed at preparing for a possible disruption of natural gas flows from Russia. Economy minister Robert Habeck said supplies had been safeguarded for the time being and that Germany was closely monitoring supply flows with market operations.

During her announcement that three humanitarian corridors would be set up today, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, also said the country’s armed forces tell her there is a danger of ammunition exploding at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station, and that Russian forces occupying the plant must pull out of the area. “We demand that the UN security council immediately take measures to demilitarise the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe,” Reuters report her saying. She also said Ukraine had asked Russia at talks in Istanbul yesterday to allow 97 humanitarian corridors to be established to the worst-hit towns, cities, and villages in Ukraine. Here is the video clip of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying that talks with Russian negotiators had given some positive signals but warning Russia cannot be trusted. “These signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “Ukrainians are not naive people.” Mykola Povoroznyk, the deputy mayor of Kyiv, has said on Ukrainian television that shelling could be heard outside Kyiv overnight, but the Ukrainian capital itself was not shelled by Russian forces. Reuters report him saying: “The night passed relatively calmly, to the sounds of sirens and the sound of gunfire from battles around the city, but there was no shelling in the city itself.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced that there will be three humanitarian corridors set up in Ukraine to evacuate civilians today. Russia and China’s foreign ministers Sergei Lavrov and Wang Yi have met today in China, with a photo supplied on Twitter by Russia’s foreign ministry. How much faith is the UK government putting into Russia’s words about a military de-escalation? “Well, I don’t think a lot.” Those are the words of the UK’s deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, on Sky News this morning. He went on to say: We judge the Russian military machine by its actions, not just its words. There’s obviously some scepticism that it will regroup, to attack again, rather than seriously engage in diplomacy or anything of that nature. Of course, the door to diplomacy will always be left ajar. But I don’t think you can trust what is coming out to the mouth of Putin’s war machine. He described Russia as using “asymmetric forces”, saying: With Russia, you have to deal with a whole range of possibilities. You’ve got the fact that they hire mercenaries, you’ve got the fact that engage in cyber, the fact that they engage in poisoning, we’ve seen that in the past as well. The whole gamut comes with Russia and that why it is such an unconventional adversary. On the question of war crimes, Raab said: I was very clear with the foreign secretary and myself that we support the international criminal court which is looking at the allegations and the reports of war crimes in Ukraine. So the UK went out to the Hague and we offered support, we offered financial and technical support to the ICC prosecutor. On top of that, last Thursday, I hosted a meeting in The Hague, 38 countries joined, and we said on the basis of our package, what can we do together to make sure that there is no impunity for war crimes in Ukraine. Things like satellite imagery, not just to prove the crime, but who is responsible for it. Preserving evidence in the fluid situation of a war zone is very difficult, which is why that support is important now. It’s about what we can do now to preserve that evidence. And that also tells the commanders and Putin himself and everyone in between, that they’re at serious risk of ending up in the dock of a court and behind bars if they engage in further war crimes. It is Martin Belam here on this live blog now for the next few hours – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand this liveblog over to my colleague, Martin Belam, here is a summary of events so far: The UK’s Ministry of Defence claims Russian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganise and resupply. Ukraine’s eastern city of Lysychansk has been shelled by heavy artillery this morning with widespread damage to residential areas, according to local officials. A US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are about to depart from the International Space Station (ISS) together on a Soyuz capsule back to earth this morning, despite heightened US-Russian antagonism over the war in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in China today in his first visit since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine last month. Western and Ukrainian officials have reacted warily to Russia’s claim that it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. More than a month after the start of an invasion that has largely stalled in the eyes of the west, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the talks had been “positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”, adding that Ukraine had no intention of reducing its military efforts. US president Joe Biden said: “I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”. “What Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter.” Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “not naive people” and he saw “no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction”. He also called for sanctions to be strengthened. “They must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real.” In Ukraine’s intelligence report as of 10pm local time, its military claimed Russian troops continue to withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. China’s ambassador to the UN addressed the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing a “worrying account of the situation on ground” and called for the protection of civilian lives and respect for international humanitarian law. Dai Bing said increasing sanctions on Russia will “give rise to new humanitarian problems” including hitting global energy, food, economic, trade and financial markets. Moscow’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations does not represent a ceasefire. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there is still “a long way to go” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. Following Russia’s announcement, two senior US officials said the US was seeing Russia beginning to withdraw some of its forces from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what it believes is a “major” change in Russian strategy. Another US official said any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv would constitute a “redeployment, not a withdrawal”. The UK has also seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, Downing Street said. But it insisted the UK will judge tentative steps towards a possible peace deal by actions rather than words. “We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory,” the PM’s spokesperson said. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. Ukraine called for “an international mechanism of security guarantees” similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits alliance members to defend one another. The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the guarantee would involve countries such as the US, UK, Turkey, France and Germany being “legally actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression”. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region. In a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war, Shoigu claimed the “main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed”. A Russian airstrike hit a government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. At least 12 people were killed and 33 injured, Ukraine’s emergencies agency said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on Russia and Ukraine to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and other frontline places as vital supplies run out. “Time is running out” for people in Mariupol, it warned, adding that there was still a lack of “concrete agreements” for the safe passage and evacuations of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city. The Kremlin dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reports were false and “part of the information war”. A Ukrainian soldier who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” while defending an island has been awarded for his services, local authorities said. Roman Hrybov was serving on Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on 24 February. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Hrybov was released from Russian captivity and is now home in Cherkasy. A £38m superyacht owned by an unnamed Russian businessman has been detained in Canary Wharf in London as part of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, known as Phi, is subject to the first detention of a superyacht in UK waters, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said, and its owner was “We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,” he said. Americans may be ‘singled out’ by Russian forces in Ukraine, the US state department said in its latest travel advisory. “There are continued reports of US citizens being singled out and detained by the Russian military in Ukraine and when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus,” it said. Ukrainian playwright Natal’ya Vorozhbit writes for us about her desperate departure from Kyiv after Russia’s invasion. “How does it feel to be bombed out of your home town?” she asks. “I grabbed two rings, took my mother, daughter and the cat.” Read Vorozhbit’s full story below. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence report, claiming Russian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganise and resupply. The full report, published just after 6am GMT, reads: Russian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganise and resupply. Such activity is placing further pressure on Russia’s already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having reorganising its units in forward areas within Ukraine. Russia will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground manoeuvre capability through mass artillery and missile strikes. Russia’s stated focus on an offensive in Donetsk and Luhansk is likely a tacit admission that it is struggling to sustain more than one significant axis of advance.” Ukraine’s eastern city of Lysychansk has been shelled by heavy artillery this morning with widespread damage to residential areas, according to local officials. “There is significant destruction of high-rise buildings. Information about the number of dead and wounded is being specified. There are a lot of blockages,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai wrote in a Telegram message. Western diplomats and leaders have also expressed doubts that Russia’s promise to withdraw troops and engage in peace talks was more than a ploy to dress up setbacks on the ground and a possible tactical exercise in playing for time. US president Joe Biden remained cautious, saying it remains to be seen if Russia will follow through on its pledge to scale down its military operations in northern Ukraine. An unconvinced Biden told a White House press conference on Tuesday: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”. Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said that there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.” John Kirby, press secretary at the Pentagon, warned against “fooling ourselves” over the Kremlin’s claims. “Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” he said. “But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.” One official said: “Certainly, in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious … it’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time.” A US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are about to depart the International Space Station (ISS) together on a Soyuz capsule back to earth this morning, despite heightened US-Russian antagonism over the war in Ukraine. The Russian Soyuz capsule carrying Nasa’s Mark Vande Hei and his cosmonaut peers Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov is scheduled to undock from ISS at 6:45am GMT and make a parachute landing in central Kazakhstan nearly five hours later. The landing zone lies roughly 400 km (250 miles) to the northeast of Russia’s space launch facility at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Just one day after Russia invaded Ukraine - Dmitry Rogozin, the director-general of Russia’s space agency, accused the US of trying to “destroy” cooperation at the ISS. “If you block cooperation with us, then who is going to save the ISS from an uncontrolled descent from orbit and then falling onto the territory of the United States or Europe?” he said. Nasa, however, said that it would continue to work with all its international partners - including Russia - and that export sanctions continue to allow it to work with Russia. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts. In a video address early on Wednesday, he said: Of course, we see all the risks. Of course, we see no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction. Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted. The facts – if they change on our land.” The Ukrainian leader urged his people to “not lose vigilance” despite saying the signals received from peace talks with Russia appeared positive. The situation has not become easier. The scale of the challenges has not diminished. The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine would not be reducing its defence efforts. The enemy is still in our territory. The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and air strikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts. Yes, we can call positive the signals we hear from the negotiating platform. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells.” Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has arrived in China today in his first visit since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine last month. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed Lavrov had landed in the eastern city of Huangshan, posting photos of delegates descending from a plane and being met by Chinese health officials in hazmat suits. Lavrov will attend a series of meetings hosted by China to discuss ways to help Afghanistan. Diplomats from the United States and Afghanistan’s neighbours are also expected to attend. Russia’s assault on Ukraine is likely to loom large over proceedings and comes as the nation continues to refuse to condemn the invasion, lagging behind many other countries in providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has provided some more information this morning about their earlier allegation that Russia is merely conducting a “rotation of individual units” and not withdrawing troops as promised. During Tuesday’s peace talks in Turkey, Russian negotiators promised to cut back some of its military action, however the Ukrainian military has claimed Russian forces continue to “conduct full-scale armed aggression” against the country. A report published at 6am local time by Ukraine’s ministry of defence reads: Units of the 4th (Tskhinvali district, South Ossetia) and 7th (Abkhazia) military bases, which are part of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of Russian federation, were transferred from the occupied territories of Georgia to the territory of Ukraine in order to recruit the armed forces of the Russian federation. From the 4th military base, three BTGs with a total number of up to 1,200 Russian and Ossetian servicemen were formed and sent to Ukraine. Two units of the 7th Military Base were formed, which is about 800 people.” In the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, Russian troops continue to “commit illegal acts against the local population” and “loot the homes and apartments of local residents, detain pro-Ukrainian activists and government officials in Ukraine”, officials said. In the temporarily occupied territory of Luhansk region, Ukrainian military cheifs believe the occupying authorities plan to hold another wave of mobilisation from 1 April and that is it possible that such efforts will be made in the recently occupied territories of the region. The report continues to claim Russia is having “problems with staffing units” and servicemen of the 26th tank regiment of the 47th tank division have begun “to submit reports requesting to terminate the contract and send them to a permanent location for further service” after initially signing contracts to participate in the war with Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces claim Russian troops continue to withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv in the country’s north but described the movement are merely “a rotation of individual units” with the aim to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. A report released late Tuesday night and published by the ministry of defence reads: According to some indications, the Russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the east. At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers’ refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.” The extent of the destruction inflicted upon Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol is seen in the images below. Smoke billows from high rise apartment buildings across the city and authorities continue to work to stem the damage to city infrastructure and homes. Ukraine said it feared around 300 people had been killed in one attack alone when the Mariupol theatre was bombed on 16 March. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we continue to report all the latest breaking and developing news from Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands after Tuesday’s peace talks made little concrete progress. Western and Ukrainian officials have reacted warily to Russia’s claim that it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. More than a month after the start of an invasion that has largely stalled in the eyes of the west, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

The Japanese conglomerate’s mooted 2.9GW nuclear power station on Anglesey is next in line in the UK’s nuclear plans after EDF Energy’s 3.2GW Hinkley Point C scheme in Somerset. However, Japan’s TV network Asahi reported that the Wylfa Newydd scheme may be scrapped, sending Hitachi’s shares up by almost 3%, before ending up by 1%. The project is expected to be discussed at the Japanese multinational’s board meeting on Tuesday. The Guardian understands that cancelling the power station would result in Hitachi having to write off its near-£2bn investment in the project. Hiroaki Nakanishi, the board’s chairman, last week admitted the company was struggling to find investors willing to finance the plant. Hitachi faced “an extremely severe situation”, he said. If the Wylfa project was to fail it would be a major blow to the UK’s hopes for a fleet of new nuclear plants to meet its carbon targets and fill the energy gap created by old coal and nuclear plants being taken offline. Ministers have already been hit by the recent collapse of plans for a significant new nuclear plant in Cumbria after Toshiba failed to find a buyer for the Moorside project. However, it would be surprising if Hitachi pulled the plug on Wylfa at this stage. Tripartite talks are still ongoing between the firm and the UK and Japanese governments. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said in June that the UK was considering taking a “direct investment” in the power station, overturning decades of policy of not taking a stake in civil nuclear power. But such projects should be financed by the private sector “in the longer term”, he said. The UK is understood to have offered to take at least a £5bn-plus public stake to make the financing of the £16bn power station work. The company and government are still continuing with talks, which insiders described as “fairly intense”. Hitachi’s British subsidiary Horizon will need to reach an agreement with the UK by the middle of 2019, if it is to clear EU state aid approval and hit its timetable of making a final investment decision in mid-to-late 2020. Wylfa is one of two sites that Hitachi is considering, with an identical 2.9GW plant planned for Oldbury in Gloucestershire. A Horizon spokesperson said: “Since the secretary of state’s statement to the House in June this year we’ve been in formal negotiations with the UK government regarding financing of the Wylfa Newydd project in a way that works both for investors and the UK electricity customer.” The company said the negotiations were commercially confidential and it would not comment on rumours or speculation. Greenpeace UK said investors could see the economics of new nuclear did not add up. “As Hitachi contemplates whether to pull out of Wylfa, UK government might contemplate whether they’ve been backing the wrong horse for many years,” said Doug Parr, the group’s chief scientist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-urges-talks-with-putin-biden-flags-clear-sign-russia-considering-chemical-weapons-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T04:56:12Z","webTitle":"US condemns Moscow’s refusal to rule out use of nuclear weapons – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-urges-talks-with-putin-biden-flags-clear-sign-russia-considering-chemical-weapons-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/22/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-urges-talks-with-putin-biden-flags-clear-sign-russia-considering-chemical-weapons-live","fields":{"headline":"US condemns Moscow’s refusal to rule out use of nuclear weapons – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is now closed. You can follow the latest developments at our new blog here: Before we launch a new blog for the day, here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush west of Mariupol. “Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive,” he said, adding that 100,000 people remained in the city living “in inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing”. Russian forces are now inside Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. Two “super-powerful bombs” rocked the city on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. Russia’s combat power in Ukraine has declined below 90% of its pre-invasion levels for the first time since its attack began, a senior US defence official said on Tuesday, suggesting heavy losses of weaponry and growing casualties and describing morale issues, command-and-control problems, a reliance on conscripts and a stalled advance to Kyiv. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. Peskov told the broadcaster that such arms could be used if Russia faced an “existential threat”. Russia has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads. The Pentagon later condemned Peskov’s refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons. US President Joe Biden is expected to announce new sanctions against Russia and new measures to tighten existing ones when he visits Brussels this week. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force has accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, where US president Joe Biden is also planning to push for new sanctions against Russia. “Three important summits are scheduled this week: G7, Nato and the EU,” he said. “New packages of sanctions, new support.” About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands since the invasion began on 24 February. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have claimed. The statements were described as “plausible” by western officials. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, the minister added. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. The United States and its western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday. Russian forces have “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. “Russian occupiers illegally seized the newest laboratory,” the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said in a statement late on Tuesday. The laboratory processes radioactive waste and contains “highly active samples and samples of radionuclides” which are now “in the hands of the enemy” the agency added. The lab was described as a “unique complex with powerful analytical capabilities” unavailable elsewhere in Europe. The Russians captured the plant in the first few days of the war, holding workers there hostage for weeks before some were released. The Pentagon has condemned Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov’s refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons during the Ukraine conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the threat of using nuclear weapons and in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Peskov refused to rule out their use. Peskov told the broadcaster that such arms could be used if Russia faced an “existential threat”. Russia has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads. US department of defense spokesman John Kirby said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous”. Speaking to reporters, he said: It’s not the way a responsible nuclear power should act.” However, Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture”. “We monitor this as best we can every day,” he added. Former US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta also criticised Peskov’s comments. “I don’t see how you can see it any other way but as dangerous when Russia is looking for a possible excuse for the use of low-yield nuclear weapons,” Panetta told CNN. “And basing it frankly on a very false premise that somehow Russia is being threatened. I think that presents a real concern that Russia at least is considering that possibility.” Stock markets have risen sharply in Asian trade on Wednesday thanks to wider uncertainty about the state of the US economy and the possibility of interest rate rises. The prospect of increased borrowing costs in the US means that American government bonds have dropped in value, sending investors scurrying to put their money into stocks and shares – despite a lot of volatility in the financial markets because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Amid alarm about an escalating global conflict, some fear the US Federal Reserve could cause a recession by increasing rates as it tries to tackle inflation. Leading economist Mohamed El-Erian told Bloomberg the Fed’s credibility was being eroded, and thatit “appears to have a choice between risking a recession or prolonging inflation...This awful trade-off is familiar to too many developing countries”. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6%, with Hong Kong, Seoul and Sydney all registering similar sized gains, Reuters reports. The index is at its highest since 4 March. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 2.5% to touch a two-month top and the moves follow a gain of 1.1% for the S&amp;P 500 and nearly 2% for the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Bond markets dipped further with two-year Treasury yields are up 76 basis points (bps) in March and 10-year yields are up almost 60 bps to 2.4154%, the highest since 2019. When the yield or interest rate goes up, the value of bonds goes down. The invasion has wreaked havoc across all markets, with a big jump in volatility. Commodities such as oil, aluminium and wheat, for example, have soared because of fears of scarcity and loss of supply from Russia and Ukraine. US president Joe Biden will travel to Europe for a meeting with leaders of Nato, the EU and G7 in Brussels on Thursday, where he will announce more US aid to help tackle the growing refugee crisis in Poland and other eastern European countries, the White House has said. In a statement, the White House said Biden will outline “further American contributions to a coordinated humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees”. Elon Musk’s Space X has reportedly sent “thousands” of Starlink dishes to Ukraine in order to bolster its internet connectivity. Company president Gwynne Shotwell told CNBC on Tuesday that the kits were largely funded by private sources. Starlink dishes were initially sent to Ukraine shortly after Russia invaded and have been installed across the country, including a rooftop in the southern port of Odesa. In recent weeks, internet access across Ukraine came under cyber attacks, various media outlets reported. “I’m proud that we were able to provide the terminals to folks in Ukraine. It’s been enormously helpful, I think, to ensure people are still communicating,” Shotwell said during a panel at the Satellite 2022 conference in Washington, DC. Estonia’s former president has said he is hosting two Ukrainian refugees at his own private house. In a tweet on Tuesday, Toomas Hendrik said two refugees from Kyiv are staying at his home. In Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s nightly national address, the Ukrainian president provided an update on the situation unfolding in Mariupol, saying there are still 100,000 people in the city living in “inhumane” conditions while accusing Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush, just 20km south-west of Mariupol. As of today, there are about 100,000 people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing.” The president added that officials are continuing to attempt to organise humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents but efforts have been sabotaged by continued shelling. Sadly, almost all of our efforts are sabotaged by Russian occupants, by [their] shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian convoys was seized by occupants on an arranged route near Mangush. Employees of the State Emergency Service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo.” Despite the difficulties, Zelenskiy said 7,026 people were able to be saved from Mariupol with efforts continuing to arrange humanitarian corridors in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Luhansk regions. Zelenskiy wrapped up his nightly address by promising he was continuing to work “to push Russia towards peace”. We are continuing to work on various levels to push Russia towards peace, towards the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are continuing negotiations that basically take place daily. It is very hard, sometimes, scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward.” Zelenskiy also noted the three summits scheduled for this week: G7, Nato and the EU. New packages of sanctions, new support. We’ll keep working and will keep fighting as much as we can. Until the end. Courageously and openly. On all of those platforms. With full energy. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. We will have rest when we win. And it will definitely happen.” Recently released satellite images taken by private US space technology company Maxar Technologies show scenes of devastation across the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Multiple destroyed apartment buildings are seen burning buildings in the Livoberezhnyi district as thousands of residents sought to escape the Russian siege of the city on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden is expected to announce new sanctions against Russia and new measures to tighten existing ones when he visits Brussels this week. The United States is preparing sanctions on more than 300 members of Russia’s lower house of parliament as soon as Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed officials and internal documents. “No final decisions have been made about who we will sanction and how many we will sanction,” said a White House spokesperson. “We will have additional sanctions measures to announce that will be rolled out in conjunction with our allies on Thursday when the President has the opportunity to speak with them.” Biden’s Europe trip is also set to include an announcement on joint action to enhance energy security on the continent, which is highly reliant on Russian gas, and a visit to Poland to show solidarity with Ukraine’s neighbour. Scenes of normality contrast with the catastrophic attacks Russia continues to launch on Ukraine. The United States and its western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday. The likelihood that any bid to exclude Russia outright would be vetoed by others in the club - which includes China, India, Saudi Arabia and others - raised the prospect of some countries instead skipping G20 meetings this year, the sources said. The G20 along with the smaller Group of Seven - comprising just the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Britain - is a key international platform for coordinating everything from climate change action to cross-border debt. According to Reuters, a senior G7 source said: There have been discussions about whether it’s appropriate for Russia to be part of the G20. If Russia remains a member, it will become a less useful organisation.” Asked whether US President Joe Biden would move to push Russia out of the G20 when he meets with allies in Brussels this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Tuesday: “We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.” However, the United States plans to consult with its allies before any other pronouncements are made, he said. A European Union source separately confirmed the discussions about Russia’s status at forthcoming meetings of the G20, whose rotating chair is currently held by Indonesia. “It has been made very clear to Indonesia that Russia’s presence at forthcoming ministerial meetings would be highly problematic for European countries,” said the source, adding there was however no clear process for excluding a country. US defense officials have praised the bravery and courage of the Ukrainian people in their fight against the Russian invasion. A senior US official described the Ukrainian defence as one of “bravery and courage and just the absolute grit that you see coming out of the Ukrainian people”. “They’re being very creative, very nimble,” the official said, adding that Ukrainians “have been defending their airspace with great dexterity”. Referring to Russia’s continued catastrophic attacks, the official said: And rather than demoralising the Ukrainians, I think you’ve all seen that this kind of violence has only motivated them more, which means that they’re resisting more, which means the Russians continue to get frustrated and flummoxed and kind of stuck where they are.” However, the official did some credit to the work of the United States and other western nations, saying: So this stiff defence that they’re putting up did not just happen by accident. And while a lot of it is due to their bravery and their courage and just the absolute grit that you see coming out of the Ukrainian people, it also is a reflection of a lot of work by the United States and other western nations to provide them this competency as well as the capability. So they get -- they must get and should get -- the lion’s share of the credit here. But obviously the tools that they’re using, in many cases, came from outside the country, the United States as well as other donor nations.” More from the US department of defense briefing. A senior US defense official has given a critical review of Russia’s ability to take over Ukraine, describing morale issues, command-and-control problems, a reliance on conscripts and a stalled advance to Kyiv. The official said: We still hold them about 30 kilometers to the east of Kyiv, which is where they were last week. The official also described morale issues inside Russian ranks Anecdotally, we still assess that the Russians are experiencing morale issues at various levels and at various places ... They did not expect this level of resistance. Describing a reliance on conscript soldiers, the official added: Some of them were not told what they were actually going to be doing inside Ukraine. We know they relied on conscripts, and they still do. I mean, still it has been largely a conscript army. And so these are very young men who haven’t -- don’t have a long experience with soldiering and -- and we believe that all those factors are combining to affect their morale.” Additionally, the official said Russian forces continue to be plagued by logistical problems. We believe that they are having command-and-control problems just in terms of communications. And again, this is another one of those logistic/sustainment issues that we’ve seen them struggle with. I mean, they just weren’t fully-prepared for operations of this intensity for this long on so many different multiple lines of attack, and so we do see them having some command-and-control difficulties, both in terms of a military operational concept issue -- in other words, being able to integrate air to ground, being able to make decisions in real-time effectively, but also from a physical perspective, just in terms of their ability to communicate over established links.” Ultimately, the official said Russia has not achieved their objectives, which is population centres so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine. So what have they gained in -- in now 26 days? They got Melitopol’, they got Berdyans’k and they got Kherson. That’s it. They don’t have Kyiv, they don’t have Kharkiv, they don’t have Mariupol, although -- obviously, you guys know this better than me -- I mean, there’s a lot of fighting going on there.” Russia’s combat power in Ukraine has declined below 90% of its pre-invasion levels for the first time since its attack began, a senior US defence official said on Tuesday, suggesting heavy losses of weaponry and growing casualties. The United States has estimated Russia assembled more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine before the 24 February invasion, along with enough aircraft, artillery, tanks and other firepower for its full-scale attack. The US defence official, on condition of anonymity and according to a transcript published by the US department of defense, told reporters: We assess Russian combat power at just below 90 percent. They’re expending an awful lot, but they also built up an awful lot since the early fall, and they just have a lot available to them. For the first time they may be just a little bit below 90 percent.” The official did not provide evidence for the claims. They have put a lot into this fight, and they still have a lot left. I -- we recognise that they are taking casualties every day. They are losing aircraft. They are losing armour and vehicles, no doubt about that -- tanks, APCs, artillery units, helicopters, fixed-wing jets. They’re losing, -- you know, I wouldn’t say they’re losing everything every day in those categories, but we do see them continue to suffer casualties and losses, but they had -- they built up an awful lot of combat power, as we said way back in the fall, that Mr. Putin had arranged an oppressive alignment of combined-arms capability that he still has the vast majority available to him.” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan estimated on Tuesday the number of Russian casualties was in the thousands but declined to offer a precise figure. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy also provided an update on the situation unfolding in Mariupol, saying there are still 100,000 people in the city living in “inhumane” conditions. As of today, there are about 100,000 people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing.” The president added that officials are continuing to attempt to organise humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. Sadly, almost all of our efforts are sabotaged by Russian occupants, by [their] shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian convoys was seized by occupants on an arranged route near Mangush. Employees of the State Emergency Service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo.” Despite the difficulties, Zelenskiy said 7,026 people were able to be saved from Mariupol. Russian president Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have continued talks, the French government has confirmed. In a statement, the Elysée Palace said that the pair spoke by phone on Tuesday to continue Macron’s previous conversations with Putin regarding a ceasefire and ongoing safety concerns. The statement read: There is currently no agreement but President Macron remains convinced of the need to continue his efforts. There is no other way out than a ceasefire and Russia’s good faith negotiations with Ukraine.” It added that Macron “stands alongside Ukraine”. Macron also spoke on Tuesday to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi ahead of the summit in Brussels on Thursday. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you and we continue to deliver all the latest breaking developments in Ukraine. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy wrapped up his nightly address by promising he was continuing to work “to push Russia towards peace”. We are continuing to work on various levels to push Russia towards peace, towards the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are continuing negotiations that basically take place daily. It is very hard, sometimes, scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward.” Zelenskiy also noted the three summits scheduled for this week: G7, Nato and the EU.

With all our strength. And we will not get tired. We will have rest when we win. And it will definitely happen.” Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city of Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. Two “super-powerful bombs” rocked Mariupol on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. More than 200,000 people are trapped in the city, where the situation has been described as a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, Human Rights Watch said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush. “Employees of the State Emergency Service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo,” he said in his latest address on Telegram. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit this week, where US president Joe Biden is also planning to push for new sanctions against Russia. “Three important summits are scheduled this week: G7, NATO and the EU.” he said. “New packages of sanctions, new support. About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson were running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have alleged. The claims of major shortages were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv said today, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” At least one person has died after drones attacked a scientific institute in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, AFP reports. Rescuers were seen removing a body from the scene, as smoke rose from the seven-storey building at the Institute for Superhard Materials in north-west Kyiv, part of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, the minister added. A Ukrainian official claimed that Russian forces had used phosphorous in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshitsky, first deputy head of the National Police of Kyiv, said in a post on Facebook on Tuesday: “Another use of phosphorus munitions in Kramatorsk. Prohibitions and conventions are for the civilized world.” The claim could not be verified. A Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, has been released from captivity by Russian forces, Ukrainian outlet Hromadske said. There is, however, growing concern about well-known photojournalist Maksym Levin, who was last reported to be on the frontline near Kyiv, but nobody has had any contact with him since 13 March. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on the southern occupied city of Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. A Russian court has sentenced jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to nine years in prison after convicting him of fraud and contempt of court. Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. The European Commission will set out plans tomorrow for how people fleeing Ukraine will access jobs, education and housing in the EU, Reuters reports. Maroš Šefčovič, the commission’s vice-president, said the bloc must ensure the right resources are in place to meet people’s needs after initial efforts were focused on receiving people at the border. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Guardian staff Bermet Talant reports: We have some more information on the humanitarian convoy that president Zelenskiy said had been seized by Russian forces: Iryna Vereschuk, deputy prime minister, said 11 buses and two cars from Ukraine’s state emergency service were stopped at the Russian checkpoint at the entry to Manhush. As of 21:15 local time, the fate of 11 drivers and 4 employees of the State Emergency Service was unknown, she said on Telegram. News organisation Ukraine Pravda reported that the vehicles were taken in an unknown direction, and negotiations for setting the captives free were continuing. In his address, Zelenskiy recapped his conversations with Pope Francis, his address to the Italian parliament, and his talks with Slovakian president Zuzana Čaputová and with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. “I am grateful to the Greek Foreign Minister, who was the first European official to decide to support the work of our humanitarian corridors in Mariupol in order to save our people from the city and bring humanitarian aid that is very crucial for everyone there,” he added. “Three important summits are scheduled this week: G7, Nato and the EU.” he continued. “New packages of sanctions, new support. We’ll keep working and will keep fighting as much as we can. Until the end. Courageously and openly. On all of those platforms. With full energy. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. We will have rest when we win. And it will definitely happen.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush. “Employees of the State Emergency Service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo,” he said in his latest address on Telegram. “Despite all difficulties, we have saved 7,026 people from Mariupol. Tomorrow we will continue this important work. Our representatives are trying to arrange humanitarian corridors in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Luhansk regions.” Joe Biden is planning new sanctions on Russian lawmakers, the Wall Street Journal From WSJ: President Biden intends to announce the sanctions on more than 300 members of the Russian State Duma as soon as Thursday during his trip to Europe, where he will meet with allies from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to formulate their next steps, according to U.S. officials and internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The sanctions will be announced in coordination with the European Union and members of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, U.S. officials said. The National Security Council declined to comment. “The president is traveling to Europe to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters today. He signaled there will be “new designations, new targets” for sanctions. A Ukrainian official claimed that Russian forces had used phosphorous in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Bermet Talant reports: Oleksiy Biloshitsky, first deputy head of the National Police of Kyiv, said in a post on Facebook on Tuesday: “Another use of phosphorus munitions in Kramatorsk. Prohibitions and conventions are for the civilized world.” The claim could not be verified. White phosphorus is routinely held by militaries around the world and is used legally in combat as a smokescreen in daytime and as an incendiary to light up an area at night. But it is illegal to use it against civilians because it causes serious and exceptionally painful burns on contact with skin. The disappearance of a photojournalist who was reporting from a frontline near Kyiv more than a week ago has fuelled growing concerns over the dangers faced by Ukrainian journalists covering Russia’s invasion of their country. Maks Levin has not been heard from since 13 March, when he was reporting in the Vishgorod district, north of Kyiv, where he had been capturing both the fighting and fleeing civilians, according to fellow Ukrainian photographer Markiian Lyseiko. Levin’s phone has been out of service since he sent his last message that morning, when he was stopped while travelling between villages, Lyseiko wrote on Facebook, adding that he believes Levin may have been injured or captured by Russian forces during intense fighting that day. Levin’s disappearance has prompted public appeals for information from fellow Ukrainian journalists. “Our good friend, talented war photojournalist Maks Levin, has gone missing. He had yet another field day in a combat zone outside Kyiv on March 13. Ever since then, no one has had any contact with him. If you follow this war, you have definitely seen a lot of his works,” tweeted Illia Ponomarenko, defence reporter for the Kyiv Independent. Press freedom groups say that Levin is not the first Ukrainian journalist to have disappeared. The Committee to Protect Journalists said two other journalists, Oleh Baturyn and Viktoria Roshchina, had previously gone missing but have since been released by their abductors, who are presumed to belong to the Russian armed forces.

The claims of major shortages were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis. The report from the Ukrainian armed forces general command was said to be consistent with evidence that the Russian advance had stalled, and that they had reverted to using “indiscriminate and attritional” artillery attacks on civilians. “We do think that the Russian forces have used a lot of material including particular categories of weapons and we have seen isolated reports of particular units that have lacked supplies of one sort or another,” the official said. “It is consistent with an advance which has ground to a halt. Failures in the logistic chain has been one of the reasons they have not been as effective as they hoped.” A Pentagon official added there were continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of adequate clothing. “They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said. The Ukrainian military said that a major problem for the Russian advance was a failure to lay down a fuel pipe to the front, although the claim could not be independently verified.

Zero’ Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko tells ITV News that [Boris Johnson] should ‘please’ avoid comparing the Ukrainian resistance to Brexit Previously, Johnson caused fury among political leaders across Europe – and outrage among opponents of Brexit at home – after he compared the resistance of the Ukrainian people to Russia’s invasion to the UK’s decision to leave the EU, reported the Guardian’s Toby Helm and Daniel Boffey. Russia defaulting on its foreign debts would likely have “limited” consequences for the global financial system, said a senior official at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today, reported AFP. “If there were a default, I think the direct effect on the rest of the world would be quite limited, because the numbers that we’re looking at are relatively small from a global perspective,” said Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director of the IMF. “It is not a systemic risk to the global economy,” although some banks have “greater exposure”, said Gopinath in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US and other allies have imposed tough financial sanctions against Russia, causing concern about Russia’s ability to make debt payments. While Russia has still managed to service its loans, worries remain about the future, especially after the expiration of a US exemption that allows the transactions on 25 May. The US State Department said today that it “strongly condemns” Russia’s trial against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, reports Reuters. The US State Department said on Tuesday that it “strongly condemns” what it called Russia’s “orchestration of a sham trial” against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, after a court found him guilty of large-scale fraud and contempt of court, a move likely to extend Navalny’s jail time by years. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the “disturbing” decision was another example of a widening crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression that he said Russia was carrying out to hide its war in Ukraine. Navalny was sentenced to nine years in a maximum security penal colony today after being found guilty on fraud and contempt charges. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss spoke with Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba today about the UK’s plans to increase economic pressure on Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will virtually participate in the Nato summit happening later this week, reports Reuters citing Interfax news. Details on how Zelenskiy will participate are still being worked out, according to his press aide. From Reuters: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will take part virtually in a NATO summit on Thursday to discuss the war with Russia, but exact details are still being worked out, Interfax Ukraine cited Zelenskiy’s press spokesman as saying on Tuesday. The spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, said that at a minimum, Zelenskiy would make a video address to the meeting and might take part in the full discussion, Interfax said. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand now: Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city of Mariupol, a senior US defence official said.

The report from the Ukrainian armed forces general command was said to be consistent with evidence that the Russian advance had stalled, and that they had reverted to using “indiscriminate and attritional” artillery attacks on civilians. “We do think that the Russian forces have used a lot of material, including particular categories of weapons and we have seen isolated reports of particular units that have lacked supplies of one sort or another,” the official said. “It is consistent with an advance which has ground to a halt. Failures in the logistic chain has been one of the reasons they have not been as effective as they hoped.” A Pentagon official added there were continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of warm weather gear. “They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said. A quick snap from Reuters: Russia will only use nuclear weapons if its very existence were threatened, Russian state-owned news agency has cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying. At the White House, Sullivan was asked about what the US and allies would do if China decides to supply arms to Russia to shore up its invasion of Ukraine, Julian Borger reports. The president will certainly consult on the question of China’s potential participation in the conflict of Ukraine while he’s in Brussels. He’ll do so with Nato. He’ll also do so when he addresses the 27 leaders of the European Union because on April 1, the European Union is having a summit with China. And so this will be an opportunity on Thursday for the United States and our European partners to coordinate closely on what our message is. We believe we’re very much on the same page with our European partners and we will be speaking with one voice on this issue. Sullivan was also asked about Joe Biden’s decision to visit Warsaw, especially as his vice president, Kamala Harris, has just been there. “Poland has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine in terms of the refugee flows,” the national security adviser said. Poland is where the United States has surged a significant number of forces to be able to help defend and shore up the eastern flank. Poland has to contend not just with the war in Ukraine, but with Russia’s military deployments to Belarus, which have fundamentally changed the security equation there. And so for all of those reasons, we feel that it is the right place for him to go, to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally. A senior aide to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said China should play a more “noticeable role” in bringing the war in Ukraine to an end, Reuters reports. Andriy Yermak, who heads Zelenskiy’s office, also said he expected a dialogue “very soon” between Ukraine’s leader and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Speaking at a virtual news conference organised by the Chatham House think-tank in London, Yermark said: So far we’ve seen China’s neutral position. And, as I said before, we believe that China ... should play a more noticeable role in bringing this war to (an) end and in building up a new global security system. We also expect China to contribute meaningfully to this new system of security for Ukraine and we also expect China to be one of the guarantors within the framework of this security system. We treat China with utmost respect and we expect it to play a pro-active role there. Forest fires have erupted in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, with Ukraine claiming that Russian control of the abandoned power plant is hampering efforts to control the flames, Oliver Milman reports. At least seven fires have been spotted within Chernobyl’s exclusion zone via satellite imagery taken by the European Space Agency, according to a statement by Ukraine’s parliament. The fires were probably ignited by the “armed aggression of the Russian federation”, the parliament said, although it’s not clear whether it was shelling, arson or some other factor that caused the outbreak. Fires like these within 10km of the plant are “particularly dangerous”, the statement added, with Ukraine claiming its firefighters are unable to tackle the blazes due to Russia’s presence. Russian forces captured the Chernobyl plant in the opening days of the invasion of Ukraine in February. The site is known for a 1986 explosion and resulting fire that caused a major nuclear disaster, spreading radioactive contamination across Europe. The plant and surrounding area have largely been sealed off since then. However, about 200 tons of fuel remain at the bottom of the crippled reactor and is relatively unprotected. Experts have raised concern that fierce fighting in the area could damage the reactor further and cause radioactive material to escape. Ukrainian authorities say the ongoing war is also hindering attempts to monitor radiation levels at Chernobyl. “There is no data on the current state of radiation pollution of the exclusion zone’s environment, which makes it impossible to adequately respond to threats,” said Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company. “Radiation levels in the exclusion zone and beyond, including not only Ukraine, but also other countries, could significantly worsen.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is briefing the White House press about Joe Biden’s trip to Brussels and Warsaw on Thursday and Friday, Julian Borger reports. He said the US and allies would announce a new package of sanctions on Russia on Thursday. Sullivan did not go into details but he said: One of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions but on ensuring that there is joint effort to crack down on evasion, on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, or weaken, or get around the sanctions. “That is an important part of this next phase,” Sullivan said. We have applied an enormous amount of economic pressure, and in order to sustain and escalate that pressure over time, part of that is about new designations, new targets, but a big part of it is about effective enforcement. The European Commission will set out plans tomorrow for how people fleeing Ukraine will access jobs, education and housing in the EU, Reuters reports. Maroš Šefčovič, the commission’s vice-president, told reporters earlier today: Nearly 3.4 million people, overwhelmingly women and children, have already arrived in the EU after fleeing Ukraine. Both the scale and speed are unprecedented, with a child arriving in the EU every second on average. The bloc must ensure the right resources are in place to meet people’s needs, he said, after initial efforts were focused on receiving people at the border. On Wednesday, the commission will detail a series of actions to ensure access to education, jobs, healthcare and housing, “with a particular focus on children”, Šefčovič said. The European Union has granted “temporary protection” to people arriving from Ukraine, including rights to residency, access to the labour market, social welfare and medical care. A video of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, speaking by phone to an impostor posing as the Ukrainian prime minister was published on Monday – hours after Downing Street said it believed that Russian state actors were responsible for the hoax. In the clip, Wallace appears to be asked if he will support Ukraine’s nuclear aims; Russia has falsely claimed that Kyiv has nuclear ambitions. A defence source said: It’s a doctored clip. What you don’t hear is the defence secretary also saying that the UK can’t have anything to do with alleged Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, because the UK is committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The pranksters Vovan and Lexus, suspected of links to Russia’s security service, claimed responsibility for the video. The roof of a children’s hospital in Severodonetsk, Luhansk Oblast, caught fire after it was shelled by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. Seven children and 15 adults were evacuated from the hospital, it said. The Kremlin says it would not “engage in state-level banditry”, rejecting President Biden’s warnings that US businesses could become potential targets for cyber-attacks by Russia, Johana Bhuiyan reports. Biden on Monday said that there was “evolving intelligence” that Russia was considering options to attack the US, to which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded: The Russian Federation, unlike many western countries, including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry. In the event of cyber-attacks, expert Glenn S. Gerstell told Guardian reporter Kari Paul that the private sector in the US is not well equipped to defend itself because companies have been historically “reactive and side-stepped cyber-responsibility”. “We’re prepared to respond in the sense that our military has an extraordinary offensive capability to respond on a cyber level – but we are not ready to defend as a country,” Gerstell said. The private sector is not prepared for attacks. It has relied on buggy software to protect itself, and cyber-threats are growing faster than our ability to adapt to them. We need to impose some kind of mandatory solution, because the pure market solution isn’t viable. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the US Department of Defense has yet to encounter any cyber-attacks but that they “wanted to make sure that leaders knew and were aware that the Russians would probably try this kind of tactic going forward”. Though there was no certainty an attack would occur, senior White House cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger said companies that provide critical infrastructure should bolster their cyber-defences. The Pentagon has been briefing the press off-camera, Julian Borger writes. For all the talk of potential chemical or biological weapons, the US military sees no signs such weapons are being prepared for imminent use, according to reporting from the briefing. A senior defence official said there is bitter fighting in and around Mariupol, which the Russians want to be able to declare as a first strategic victory and also use to prevent Ukrainian forces being diverted to defend Kyiv. The port city is now under naval shelling from ships in the Sea of Azov. Around Mykolaiv, meanwhile, the Russians are having to withdraw in the face of pushback from the town’s Ukrainian defenders. There is also a Ukrainian counterattack around Izyum, a town 75 miles south of Kharkiv. The official said there are early indications that the Ukrainians are “now able and willing to take back territory”. The Pentagon said there are continuing morale issues among Russian troops, with food and fuel shortages, as well as frostbite due to a lack of warm weather gear. “They’re struggling on many fronts,” the US official said. It is 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city of Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. Two “super-powerful bombs” rocked Mariupol on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. More than 200,000 people are trapped in the city, where the situation has been described as a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, Human Rights Watch said. About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson were running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv said today, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” At least one person has died after drones attacked a scientific institute in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, AFP reports. Rescuers were seen removing a body from the scene, as smoke rose from the seven-storey building at the Institute for Superhard Materials in north-west Kyiv, part of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, the minister added. A Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, has been released from captivity by Russian forces, Ukrainian outlet Hromadske said. There is, however, growing concern about well-known photojournalist Maksym Levin, who was last reported to be on the frontline near Kyiv, but nobody has had any contact with him since 13 March. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on the southern occupied city of Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. A Russian court has sentenced jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to nine years in prison after convicting him of fraud and contempt of court. Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has described the war in Ukraine as “unwinnable”. Speaking to reporters today, Guterres said Ukrainians are enduring a “living hell” and the reverberations of the war in Ukraine are being felt worldwide. The Ukrainian military has claimed Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days”. A UK official said the Ukrainian military claim “sounds entirely plausible”. The wife of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked France’s first lady and other leaders’ wives for helping to ensure sick children reached safety. Writing to Le Parisien newspaper, Olena Zelenska paid tribute to Europeans who have been housing and helping Ukrainian refugees, saying they deserved a Nobel peace prize. A journalist at Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper has said that a story that appeared on its website yesterday claiming nearly 10,000 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine so far was the result of a “hack” on the website. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I will continue to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag. You can reach me on Twitter or via email. A UK official said the Ukrainian military claim that the Russian invasion army has only three days of food and ammunition left “sounds entirely plausible”, Julian Borger writes. “They have real supply chain issues,” the official said. If they were to send in weapons now, they would struggle to get them into theatre within weeks because they are so bad at this. But it’s not consistent. There are some areas that are better than others, but most of them are crap. On claims Belarus is about to enter the war, the British official was sceptical. Lukashenko’s main concern is staying in power and this would be a threat, so I think he will try to avoid it. What you might end up seeing are grey areas of people that are disavowed or people who are paid by the Russians who are on leave from the army and all that sort of thing. But I will be a little surprised if there’s a formal movement of Belarus troops. Some Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city of Mariupol, a senior US defence official said. From Foreign Policy magazine’s Jack Detsch: More than 200,000 people are trapped in Mariupol, where the situation has been described as a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, Human Rights Watch said. Two “super powerful bombs” rocked the city today even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes. A Ukrainian journalist who was reportedly held captive by Russian forces has been released, Ukrainian outlet Hromadske said. In a statement published today, Hromadske said one of their journalists, Victoria Roshchyna, was released by Russian troops on Monday after being taken prisoner on 16 March. Now she is in the area that is controlled by the Ukrainian government. She is travelling to Zaporizhzhia, where she has to meet her relatives. The media outlet said pro-Russian media had shared a video in which Roshchyna said Russian soldiers had saved her life. This record was a condition for her liberation, it was shooted under the pressure of the Russian occupiers. All truth about her detention and captivity Victoria will tell herself very soon. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on the southern occupied city of Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed, the Times reports. A letter, thought to have been written by a member of Russia’s domestic security service and dated from Monday, said the Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, where residents have staged regular rallies against the occupiers. People will be taken from their homes in the middle of the night, the letter said. Even if we have to deport as many as half the city — we are ready for that. The letter also said: If it were possible to identify protest leaders, they would have been liquidated already. Protesters are saved only by the fact that it is unclear who exactly needs to be captured. There are also fears that a move to violence may end in a real riot, which could only be suppressed by large-scale fighting. In the past few days, an order had been given “from the very top” for a solution to be found, the whistleblower said. A “great terror” coordinated by the security services would aim to reduce protest with “extremely strict methods of dispersal”, including “severe injury” to individual demonstrators. A second phase would involve “door-to-door terror” with residents kidnapped and taken abroad, the letter said. The letter is thought to have been written by the FSB insider known only by his codename Wind of Change. Earlier letters have been deemed authentic by Russian security service experts, the Times writes. At least one person has died after drones attacked a scientific institute in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday, AFP reports. Military rescuers were seen removing a body covered with a black plastic sheet from the scene, as smoke rose from the seven-storey building at the Institute for Superhard Materials in north-west Kyiv, which is part of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. A Russian defence ministry intelligence official said three people had been killed, but there was no other confirmation of the toll. The official, who asked not to be identified by name, told AFP: During today’s air raid the armed forces of the Russian Federation used Orlan drones, one of which dropped a bomb, as a result of which the premises caught fire. Later two more drones appeared and also tried drop bombs, they were downed. It used to be an industrial workshop here, a civilian institution. No military. It has been three weeks since Russia updated the official death toll of its invasion in Ukraine, leaving open the question of how many of its soldiers have been killed or wounded in the chaotic opening stages of its war, Andrew Roth writes. In early March, the Russian defence ministry admitted that 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in action and 1,500 wounded, a large number after just 10 days of fighting that pointed to the danger of its attempts to take Kyiv in a lightning raid. Critics said the official government numbers should be treated with scepticism. And US and Ukrainian officials have since claimed that Russia has suffered 10, 20 or 30 times as many casualties, claiming that Russian losses could rival the wars in Chechnya or Afghanistan. And amid an information vacuum in Russia, rumours have spread over the hundreds, or thousands more, who have been killed in the ensuing weeks. “It’s almost a state secret,” said a Russian military commentator who asked not to be quoted by name to discuss the issue. “We don’t know exactly [how many people have died] … at the given moment, it’s better to discuss other questions.” Russian news outlets continuing to operate inside the country have largely stopped reporting on the death toll from the war, as censors have forbidden any discussion that calls the conflict a “war” or “invasion”. But on Monday, the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, which frequently posts pro-Kremlin news reports, published a bombshell buried deep in a news story about the war: “According to Russian defence ministry data … 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed in action and another 16,153 had been wounded.” Just minutes later, the line was gone. No other Russian news agencies reported the remarks, and it was not clear why Komsomolskaya Pravda alone would have access to that information. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said about 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson were running out of food and medical supplies. The city of Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on 24 February. On Monday, Ukrainian armed forces said Russian troops used stun grenades and gunfire to disperse a rally of anti-occupation protesters in Kherson. Video footage showed protesters in Kherson’s Freedom Square running to escape as projectiles landed around them, as loud bangs and gunfire was heard. Footage shared on social media suggested that Russian forces continued to respond violently to peaceful protesters today. From ABC News’ Patrick Reevell: Democrat majority leader Chuck Schumer has called on the the US Senate to revoke Russia’s trade status as a “most favoured nation”. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to remove Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for Russia on 17 March. Reuters quote Schumer saying “Putin’s regime is wicked and the best message we can send him is to pass PNTR legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support.” There is growing concern about well-known photojournalist Maksym Levin, who was last reported to be on the frontline near Kyiv, but nobody has had any contact with him since 13 March. Levin’s friend Markiyan Lyseiko has told Ukrainian news source Ukrinform that the photojournalist was in Vyshhorod district. He had left his car near the village of Guta Mezhyhirska. The area where he headed into was the scene of intense fighting. Poland has said it received a “positive response” to the suggestion that Russia should be excluded from the G20 group of major economies in meetings in Washington last week. Reuters reports the Polish economic development and technology minister, Piotr Nowak, saying in a statement that the matter had been discussed, and that “during the meetings we made a proposal to exclude Russia from the G20, which was met with a positive response and approval, and the matter is to be handed over to President Biden.” Reuters says there was no immediate response from the US Department of Commerce. Nowak said the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was at the meeting. Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, and other leaders’ wives for helping to ensure sick children reached safety. And she paid tribute to Europeans who have been housing and helping Ukrainian refugees, saying they deserved a Nobel peace prize. Writing to Le Parisien newspaper, Zelenska said that when Russia began attacking Ukraine she had issued an appeal for the support of the world’s first ladies. Brigitte Macron was one of the first to respond, she added, and their relationship was “warm and friendly”. “My appeal was heard,” Zelenska said. “I want to thank all Europeans who are now helping our people, giving them homes, feeding them, encouraging them … like us, you weren’t prepared for having so many traumatised people in your country. But the way you have reacted is worth of a collective Nobel peace prize. Ukrainians are marvellous people and very grateful. Our children will never forget what you have done for us.” Read more of Kim Willsher’s report from Paris here: Olena Zelenska thanks other first ladies for supporting Ukraine In the UK, opposition leader Keir Starmer has called on the British government to “ramp up” sanctions on Russia to “cripple” its ability to function as a country. The Labour leader said western powers needed to continue their support for Ukraine, including supplying more military equipment, while avoiding direct conflict with Russia. Associated Press quote him telling BBC Radio 4’s World At One: Everybody understands why every step has to be taken to prevent this escalating into a direct Nato-on-Russia conflict. That is why we need to provide more military support, that’s why sanctions have to be ramped up again further and faster and that’s why we need to have a stronger, more compassionate humanitarian response. What we need to do is to continue to provide that level of support, continue to support the Ukrainians, and ramp up those sanctions, which need to go beyond just isolating Russia. They have to cripple its ability to function. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Moldova is putting huge pressure on its health care system and it has appealed for help from the European Union and UN agencies, the country’s health minister said today. More than 331,000 refugees have entered Moldova since Russia invaded Ukraine and 100,000 of them are still in the country, Ala Nemerenco told a joint press conference with the World Health Organization (WHO), streamed live from Chisinau. Reporting for Reuters, Karol Badohal reminds us that Moldova is a small, former Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, an EU member. It is one of Europe’s poorest countries and has a total resident population of just 2.6 million people. It aspires to join the EU and Nato. “Obviously the resources of the country are limited and we wouldn’t want this to affect or become a burden for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova,” Nemerenco said. “That is why we have addressed all our partners to ask for support in this situation,” she said. “Unfortunately, these events without any precedent here are really very serious and put our health system under very big pressure.” The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, says Ukrainians are enduring a “living hell” and the reverberations of the war in Ukraine are being felt worldwide. Skyrocketing food, energy and fertiliser prices are “threatening to spiral into a global hunger crisis”, he says, with developing nations already “suffocating under the burden of Covid”. At the same time, we cannot lose hope. From my outreach with various actors, elements of diplomatic progress are coming into view on several key issues. There is enough on the table to cease hostilities and seriously negotiate now. Guterres adds: This war isn’t winnable. Sooner or later it will have to move from the battlefields to the peace table. That is inevitable. The only question is how many more lives must be lost? How many more bombs must fall? How many Mariupols must be destroyed or many more Ukrainians and Russians will be killed? UN secretary-general António Guterres has been speaking to reporters, where he has described the war in Ukraine as “unwinnable”. Since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a month ago, the world has seen “appalling human suffering and destruction” in Ukraine, “systematic bombardments that terrorise civilians” and the “shelling of hospitals, schools, apartments buildings and shelters”, Guterres says. All of it is intensifying, getting more destructive and more unpredictable by the hour. The devastated city of Mariupol has been encircled by Russian forces for more than two weeks, subjected to relentless bombardment and shelling, Guterres said, and for what? Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house. The only outcome to all this is more suffering, more destruction and more horror as far as the eye can see. Drone video released today is said to show huge explosions at factories and industrial buildings in the besieged city of Mariupol, which continues to come under Russian bombardment. The office of the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Italy wants Ukraine to join the European Union. Ukraine had offered “heroic” resistance to the Russian invasion, Draghi said, promising continued support for refugees fleeing the fighting, as well as military aid. The Italian leader told parliament: The arrogance of the Russian government has collided with the dignity of the Ukrainian people, who have managed to curb Moscow’s expansionist aims and impose a huge cost on the invading army. The Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, delivered an address to the Italian parliament via video link earlier today, where he warned Russia’s attack on Ukraine risks causing famine in countries around the world. For Russian troops, Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in, but barbarism must not be allowed to pass. Alisher Usmanov, the Russian oligarch once said to be the UK’s richest person, claims to have placed hundreds of millions of pounds of his assets into an irrevocable trust, potentially leaving them outside the sanctions regime established by western governments, Simon Goodley reports. The tycoon – a former 30% shareholder in Arsenal football club who has also ploughed millions into sponsoring Everton and is subject to sanctions – can today be revealed as connected to at least six luxury UK properties and one central London office building, collectively worth more than £170m and held via a complex web of offshore companies and family members. The list of assets linked to Usmanov has been compiled by the Russian asset tracker, a partnership involving the Guardian, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and other international news organisations that are reporting on the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. The project has also found evidence that the oligarch has: Close relatives who are named as the owners of luxury properties in countries including Italy, Germany and Latvia. The use of a $350m private jet and a helicopter deregistered from the Isle of Man on the day Usmanov was sanctioned by the UK, plus another now deregistered from Luxembourg, the LX-VIP. A 512ft, $600m private yacht called Dilbar, along with a concession to moor the vessel until 2036 in Barcelona port, which is thought to be worth about $20m. Trans women in Ukraine are reportedly being denied passage to safer countries, despite their legal status as women and the danger posed by Russia’s transphobic policies, Lorenzo Tondo reports. As strange hands searched her body and pulled back her hair to check if it was a wig, Judis looked at the faces of the Ukrainian border guards and felt fear and despair. “Ukrainian border guards undress you and touch you everywhere,” Judis says. You can see on their faces they’re wondering ‘what are you?’ like you’re some kind of animal or something. Judis is a transgender woman whose birth certificate defines her as female. Legally, there is no reason why she should not be allowed to pass with the thousands of women who are crossing Ukrainian borders to safety every day. Yet, on 12 March at about 4am, after a long and humiliating search, border guards determined she was a man and prevented her passage into Poland. When Ukraine imposed martial law on 24 February, all men aged between 18 and 60 were banned from leaving the country. Since then, it is estimated that hundreds of Ukrainian trans people have attempted to cross the border. The Guardian has been told by activists and aid workers that, despite their legal status as women, dozens have been mistreated and pushed back at the borders, with many fearing for their lives in the event that Russia’s transphobic regime takes over. A Russian court has sentenced jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to nine years in prison after convicting him of fraud and contempt of court. Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. He was also fined 1.2m roubles (£8,700). Navalny has dismissed the latest criminal case against him as politically motivated and pleaded not guilty. Navalny was jailed last year when he returned to Russia after receiving medical treatment in Germany following a poison attack with a Soviet-era nerve agent. Navalny blamed Putin for the attack. The Kremlin said it had seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned and denied any Russian role if he was. After the last court hearing into his case on 15 March, he posted on Instagram: If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said... then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds. Here’s more on the article published yesterday in Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that said nearly 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the conflict in Ukraine, a report the paper has since claimed was the work of hackers. The online article quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had been killed and 16,153 wounded in what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Those figures had been removed from a version of the same article visible on the website on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Instead, an advisory said: On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake insert was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine. The inaccurate information was immediately removed. Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since 2 March, when it said 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today that he could not comment on the incident, saying it was a question for Komsomolskaya Pravda. He said he had no information on casualty figures. Earlier, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the newspaper article marked “only the beginning of the realisation of [the Russians’] national catastrophe”. “In the real world there are almost twice as many as Russians killed,” Podolyak wrote on Telegram. It was not possible to independently verify any of the purported casualty claims. A train carrying 780 survivors from the besieged city of Mariupol is expected to arrive at Lviv railway station within the next 10 minutes, Daniel Boffey reports. It is already 30 minutes behind schedule. The group are arriving from Zaporizhzhia, a city 125 miles north-west of Mariupol. From Lviv station, three buses will take them immediately to the Polish border from where they will be settled in Poland or Germany. Kostiantyn Labartkava, a coordinator for the Red Cross, is waiting at Lviv station to help those who arrive. He said: My experience is that they will be in a terrible state. They likely got out of Mariupol the day before yesterday. I don’t know how. People will be in tears but we will be here to help with their medical problems and whatever we can do for their psychological trauma. There will be food rations and a special package for children of sweets, juice and cookies. We expect more tomorrow. The US embassy in Kyiv cited Ukraine’s foreign ministry as saying 2,389 Ukrainian children have been “illegally removed” from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts and taken to Russia. The embassy said: This is not assistance. It is kidnapping. Kyiv has accused Moscow of illegally deporting children from Mariupol amid reports that Russian troops were directing civilians towards the Russian-controlled breakaway eastern regions of Donbas. In a statement on Monday, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Russian forces had forcibly deported 2,389 children from Donetsk and Luhansk, and called the move “a gross violation of international law”. From Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general: The Guardian could not verify these figures. A superyacht linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was held up by a group of Ukrainian protesters as it tried to dock in Turkey. Protesters in a tiny inflatable dinghy attempted to block the 140-metre (460-foot) superyacht Solaris, reported to be worth £430m, from docking in the resort of Bodrum in south-west Turkey on Monday. The yacht arrived in Turkey just over a week after it left Montenegro’s Adriatic resort town of Tivat on 13 March, having skirted the waters of EU countries that have sanctioned the oligarch over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It managed to dock in Mugla, in the Aegean Sea resort of Bodrum, despite the protests. A second yacht linked to Abramovich, called Eclipse, docked in the Turkish tourist resort of Marmaris on Tuesday, Reuters cited a port source as saying. The Eclipse, which is one of the world’s biggest at 162.5 metres (533 feet) long, arrived in Marmaris after cruising south-east of the Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, according to Marine Traffic data. There was no indication that Abramovich was onboard either of the vessels. Speaking on national television, the Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Reuters reports. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, Lyashko added. Reuters could not independently verify his figures. The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, says it has confirmed 62 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine since the conflict began, resulting in 15 deaths and at least 37 injuries. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak says the war in Ukraine is not over territory but about “everything that symbolises the Russian world”. Earlier today, Podolyak described Ukraine’s forces as “combat-ready” and “logistically mature”. “It can build the infrastructure of war in a day or two and relocate the economy,” he said. Podolyak is a member of the Ukrainian negotiating team in talks with Russia, which appear to have made little progress this week. On Monday, the Kremlin accused Kyiv of stalling negotiations by making proposals unacceptable for Russia. Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it would not be possible to negotiate without meeting his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Speaking in an interview with European public television networks on Monday, Zelenskiy said: I believe that until such time as we have a meeting with the president of the Russian Federation... you cannot truly understand what they are prepared to do in order to stop the war and what they are prepared to do if we are not ready for this or that compromise. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The Ukrainian military has claimed Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days” in its operational report this morning. Officials said the situation is similar with fuel, adding: “Mobilisation is carried out chaotically ... most of them have no military specialty, because they have never served in the military.” Ukraine also claimed its forces have retaken the town of Makariv, just 50km west of Kyiv. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged direct talks with Vladimir Putin, saying: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” Zelenskiy told the Italian parliament that: “For Russian troops, Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in.” The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Ukraine had offered “heroic” resistance and that Italy would support Kyiv’s bid to join the European Union. Zelenskiy has also tweeted that he has spoken to Pope Francis, saying “the mediating role of the Holy See in ending human suffering would be appreciated”. A journalist at Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper has said that a story which appeared on its website yesterday claiming nearly 10,000 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine so far was the result of a “hack” on the website. A Ukrainian MP for Odesa, Oleksiy Honcharenko, has said he anticipated a Russian land operation against the city launched from the Black Sea. Residential areas in Odesa were reportedly targeted for the first time during the war on Monday. The mayor of Boryspil, Volodymyr Borysenko, has urged civilians to leave the town. It is located just outside Kyiv, near Ukraine’s largest international airport. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has made a new appeal to Russia to allow humanitarian supplies into the besieged southern city of Mariupol and to let civilians leave. A convoy of 15 buses carrying 1,114 evacuees is set to depart on a 200km trip to the city of Zaporizhzhia today, where people will receive food, medical and psychological support, as well as resettlement assistance. In Kyiv, a brand new shopping centre was destroyed in a missile attack that killed at least eight people, the largest attack yet on the capital. Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel peace prize-winning editor of Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta has announced he will be putting his Nobel medal up for auction to raise money for Ukrainian refugees. European Union leaders intend to set up a “trust fund” for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion and to help it rebuild after the war, according to a draft document prepared ahead of Thursday’s EU summit. Ireland is preparing for up to 200,000 refugees from Ukraine. The government’s cabinet will discuss a “significant Ukraine memo” today to consider the challenges this poses, particularly the housing challenge. I am now handing over to my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong to take you through the next few hours of our coverage. The BBC’s Orla Guerin is reporting a loud explosion in Kyiv where she is staying. Residential areas in Odesa were hit for the first time during the war on Monday, reportedly from munitions fired from Russian navy ships in the Black Sea. A Ukrainian MP for Odesa, Oleksiy Honcharenko, has told the BBC: We understand that clearly Odesa is a strategic aim of this war, but the Russian army can’t go on land there, our army is holding ground. There are hundreds of international journalists in Kyiv, and some in Odesa, who saw that these attacks are in residential areas with no military targets. They are planning a land operation against Odesa, we see their ships full of marines. I think the idea is to attack Odesa from several destinations. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the Italian parliament this morning that his country was on the brink of surviving its war with Russian forces that he warned wanted to break through to the rest of Europe. “For Russian troops, Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in, but barbarism must not be allowed to pass,” he said. Reuters report that in return, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Ukraine has offered “heroic” resistance and that Italy would support Kyiv’s bid to join the European Union. “The arrogance of the Russian government has collided with the dignity of the Ukrainian people, who have managed to curb Moscow’s expansionist aims and impose a huge cost on the invading army,” Draghi told parliament after Zelenskiy’s address. Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper was hacked on Monday, and a false story on Russian military deaths in Ukraine was posted on its site, the newspaper’s Kremlin correspondent said this morning. Alexander Gamov, the journalist, said the story – which had said nearly 10,000 Russian troops had been killed – was fake and was deleted after a few minutes. Reuters report that Gamov provided the explanation for the story, which was picked up by some western media, on the Kremlin’s daily conference call after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unable to comment on the incident. Overnight on Facebook, the mayor of Boryspil, Volodymyr Borysenko, has urged civilians to leave the town. It is located just outside Kyiv, near Ukraine’s largest international airport. In the video address, Borysenko said: “The fewer civilians in the city, the easier it is for armed forces to operate. There is no urgent need to remain in the city as firefights are going on around it. I call on the civilian population to be smart and leave town as soon as an opportunity arises.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has tweeted to say that he has spoken to Pope Francis. Alongside a photo of Zelenskiy at his desk, he said: “Told His Holiness about the difficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops. The mediating role of the Holy See in ending human suffering would be appreciated. Thanked for the prayers for Ukraine and peace.” EU leaders intend to set up a “trust fund” for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion and to help it rebuild after the war, according to a draft document seen by Agence France-Presse. Leaders from the 27-nation bloc meet in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit focused on dealing with the fallout from the Kremlin’s assault on Ukraine. “Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia’s military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine,” the draft conclusions for the meeting said. “To that end, the European Council agrees to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and calls for preparations to start without delay.” The draft, still under negotiation, gave no further details on the planned size or working of the fund. The EU has already agreed €1.2bn euros ($1.3bn) in emergency funding to help the Ukrainian authorities. The fall of Mariupol would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia, writes Bermet Talant for us today. Mariupol is a metallurgical centre for iron and steelworks, heavy machinery manufacturing, and ship repairs. Ukraine’s largest steel plants owned by the country’s leading metallurgical group, Metinvest, are located in Mariupol. One of them, Azovstal, was badly damaged by Russian shelling this week. Mariupol is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel. Not only does Mariupol lie in the territory that is claimed by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, an area recognised by Russia before the full-scale invasion, but it is also part of Vladimir Putin’s vision of “Novorossiya” – a territory stretching across eastern and southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coastline that is viewed by Putin as “historically Russian lands”. Read more of Bermet Talant’s piece here: Why is Mariupol so important to Russian forces? This comes from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Lviv: After the repeated failure of Russian forces to respect humanitarian corridors from the devastated port city of Mariupol, the world will be watching nervously as a convoy of 15 buses carrying 1,114 evacuees tries to escape today through Russian-occupied territory. The civilians are being from escorted by emergency services but not the Ukrainian military on a 200km trip from Berdiansk, a village on the outskirts of Mariupol, north west to the city of Zaporizhzhia. In Zaporizhzhia, people will receive food, medical and psychological support, as well as resettlement assistance, according to the local authorities. The development came as Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko claimed that the siege of Mariupol is being led by Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, a favourite of Vladimir Putin, who was said to be responsible for Russian operations in Syria. He has been the head of the National Center for Defense Management of the Russian Federation since December 2014 and has held the post of colonel-general since 2017. The Russian government denies shelling civilians. Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel peace prize-winning editor of Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta has announced he will be putting his Nobel medal up for auction to raise money for Ukrainian refugees. In a statement posted to the Novaya Gazeta website, he said: Novaya Gazeta and I have decided to donate the 2021 Nobel peace prize medal to the Ukrainian Refugee Fund. I ask the auction houses to respond and put up for auction this world-famous award. The article also called for an end to combat fire, an exchange of prisoners and the release of the bodies of the dead, and the provision of humanitarian corridors and assistance. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has made a new appeal to Russia to allow humanitarian supplies into the besieged southern city of Mariupol and to let civilians leave. Reuters report she said on Ukrainian television: “We demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor for civilians.” Vereshchuk also said Russia’s armed forces were preventing humanitarian supplies reaching residents of the southern city of Kherson. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a televised interview that one of Russian’s main priorities is to take control of the capital Kyiv, but trying to do so was “suicide”. He also said active hostilities between Ukraine and Russia could end within two to three weeks. Ireland is preparing for up to 200,000 refugees from Ukraine. The government’s cabinet will discuss a “significant Ukraine memo” today to consider the challenges this poses, particularly the housing challenge. Transport minister Eamon Ryan said on Monday that 10,000 had already arrived. Authorities are expected to conduct an urgent audit of the availability of hotels and house shares, but also community centres and religious order properties which could be made available as the refugee crisis worsens. Garda are also put in extra resources to speed up the vetting required of members of the public who afford homes or house shares. Quick build modular housing is also an option, ministers have said in the face of a wider housing crisis in Dublin and outside the capital. Our Emma Graham-Harrison reports in transit in Ukraine. A quick Reuters snap here that 3,528,346 Ukrainians have fled abroad according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). More than 2 million have crossed into Poland, the agency said. Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin has described the situation in his hometown of Mariupol as a “war crime”, telling Sky News in the UK that “the shelling never stops, the shooting never stops. Now there’s 300,000 people in Mariupol without food. It’s not war any more. We clearly see that Russia wants to start hunger just to force its diplomatic position.” Gurin said he was currently “very pessimistic” about a diplomatic resolution to the situation, saying that any agreement with Vladimir Putin would be worth “less than the paper it was written on”. Finland’s Nokian Tyres has said it would continue production in Russia to retain control of its local factory. Nokian’s chief executive, Jukka Moisio, told Helsingin Sanomat in an interview that the company did not want its Russian factory to end up “in wrong hands” to avoid its Russian factories being used to make tyres for the military. “In our opinion it is better that the factory is in our control than in someone else’s,” Moisio told the paper. Anne Kauranen reports for Reuters that shares in Nokian fell as much as 13% on Monday, after Finnish media reported that the company had seemed to tell analysts in a call last week that it would seek to win market share from rivals that are exiting Russia. Nokian denied this on Tuesday. Ika Ferrer Gotić, who is a news producer and anchor at the N1 news channel, has posted this video clip which she says shows Ukrainian children sleeping on the floor in Warsaw’s Central Station in Poland. Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been found guilty of large-scale fraud by a Russian court, report Reuters. Russian prosecutors are seeking to move Navalny to a maximum security penal colony for 13 years on charges of fraud and contempt of court. Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up to thwart his political ambitions. Kirsten Grieshaber has been reporting for Associated Press from Berlin on the enrolment of young refugees from Ukraine into makeshift schools there. On Monday seven-year-old Myroslav Kerashchenko was one of 40 children who joined classes. His mother, Mariia, told reporters: “It gets me emotional when I see all the help and solidarity here. Every day, I hope that we can go back to Ukraine, but it is too dangerous for now, so in the meantime it is wonderful that my son can go to school in Germany,” she added. The classes for the refugees were put together by Burcak Sevilgen and Faina Karlitski, who in only two weeks raised the funds, organised the rent-free classrooms and advertised their programme on the messaging service Telegram. The lessons will prepare the children for entering Berlin’s regular school system. Natalia Khalil, 33, from Rivne in western Ukraine, is teaching the third and fourth graders, while Tatjana Gubskaya, 56, will be in charge of the first and second graders. Gubskaya fled Ukraine with her daughter and a seven-year-old grandson, who is in her classroom. “The kids are grateful to have some kind of routine again and meet other children from Ukraine — they and their mothers have all been very stressed lately,” said Gubskaya. The teachers will be paid €500 per month (£420) in donations until they have work permits and can be officially hired. On Sky News this morning in the UK, the government’s small business minister Paul Scully has been appearing, and he was asked about US President Joe Biden’s chemical weapons warning. He told viewers: President Biden and Prime Minister [Boris Johnson] have been really resolute in making sure that we can take every action in the international community to address these crimes of Vladimir Putin. We’ve got to remember with all of this that this is Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. It is not the Russian people. So we’ve got to make sure that we can appeal to the Russian people to bring an end to this. He was also asked about the UK’s efforts to impose economic sanctions on individuals, and said: We’ve sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities. We’ve been very much on the front foot in passing the Economic Crime Bill, which I did last last week, which included registering the beneficial ownership of properties within the UK so that we can use that as a tool to better target sanctions against the individuals that are supporting Putin. A quick snap from Reuters here that Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Tuesday it was continuing to supply gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with requests from European consumers. The company said requests stood at 108 million cubic metres for 22 March, up from 104.7 million cubic metres for 21 March. Hello from London, it is Martin Belam here taking over from my colleague Samantha Lock in Sydney. If you were looking for something to listen to about the invasion of Ukraine then Tuesday’s episode of Today In Focus features our leader writer Tania Branigan talking to Nosheen Iqbal about whether China can broker an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. She says that although China and Russia share strategic interests, their economic interests diverge, and that this is where Chinese president Xi Jinping may have some leverage in swaying Russian president Vladimir Putin – should China choose to exert it. You can listen to it here: Today in Focus – Can China broker an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine? Here is where the crisis stands as of 9am in Ukraine this morning. The Ukrainian military has claimed Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days” in its operational report this morning. Officials said the situation is similar with fuel, adding: “Mobilisation is carried out chaotically ... most of them have no military specialty, because they have never served in the military.” Ukraine also claimed its forces have retaken the town of Makariv, just 50km west of Kyiv. The UK’s ministry of defence says Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol while Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have “endured yet another day of limited progress” with most forces largely stalled in place. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged direct talks with Vladimir Putin, saying: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” He also said his country will never bow to ultimatums from Russia and cities directly under attack, including the capital, Kyiv, and Mariupol and Kharkiv would not accept Russian occupation. Russia’s false accusations that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a “clear sign” that Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself, Joe Biden said. “[Putin’s] back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags,” he said. The Pentagon has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, saying there is “clear evidence” of such, and the spokesman of the US Defence Department said it would help gather evidence of them. Biden spoke after the Pentagon said it had seen “clear evidence” Russian forces were committing war crimes and that it was helping collect evidence. Biden said only India among the Quad group of countries was “somewhat shaky” in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, as India tries to balance its ties with Russia and the west. Japan criticised Russia’s decision to withdraw from bilateral peace treaty talks to formally end World War Two hostilities between Moscow and Tokyo. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, heralded new plans to develop an “EU Rapid Deployment Capacity” that could allow the bloc to “swiftly deploy up to 5,000 troops” for different types of crises. He insisted a “European army” will not be created. Russia threatened to cut ties with the US after Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a war criminal, claiming his comments “put Russian-American relations on the verge of a breach”. Almost 10,000 Russian soldiers may have already been killed in the war in Ukraine since Russia invaded almost four weeks ago, and more than 16,000 wounded, according to reports of previously-undisclosed figures from the defence ministry in Moscow revealed in a pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda. The paper later released a statement claiming it had been hacked. British prime minister Boris Johnson is “desperate” to go to Ukraine and has a “real emotional connection” with the Ukrainian people, the Tory party chair has claimed. It was reported at the weekend that Johnson wanted to go to Kyiv but on Monday No 10 sources indicated this was unlikely to happen. Some of Chernobyl’s exhausted workers have been permitted to leave the site. They have been on duty for the last three weeks since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuelling concerns about the site’s safety. The UK defence attaché has said Russia’s claims that it fired “hypersonic” missiles in western Ukraine is probably an effort to detract from the lack of progress in its ground campaign. In Kyiv, a brand new shopping centre was destroyed in a missile attack that killed at least eight people, the largest attack yet on the capital. The Ukrainian military said Russian forces hold the land corridor with Crimea and are blocking access to the Sea of Azov, according to a recent operational report. A total of 2,421 civilian casualties have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia invaded, including 925 killed and 1,496 injured, according to an update from the UN Human Rights office (OHCHR). Japan has criticised Russia’s decision to withdraw from bilateral peace treaty talks to formally end World War Two hostilities between Moscow and Tokyo. Russia and Japan have still not formally ended hostilities because of the standoff over the islands located off Japan’s northernmost island of Hokkaido. They are known in Russia as the Southern Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. Moscow’s decision to withdraw from the talks come in retaliation to sanctions imposed by Tokyo over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The islands were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War Two, and Russia claims the acquisition was as fair as any international change of boundaries after the war. Japan has disputed this. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday: “Under the current conditions Russia does not intend to continue negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty” citing Japan’s “openly unfriendly positions and attempts to damage the interests of our country”. During a parliamentary session on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida responded: This entire situation has been created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Russia’s response to push this onto Japan-Russia relations is extremely unfair and completely unacceptable. Japan would like to protest this move. We will unite with the international community and take resolution action so Japan can continue following the foundation of the international order.” Japan has imposed sanctions on 76 Russian individuals, seven banks, and 12 other bodies, including defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter, Rosoboronexport. The UK’s ministry of defence has just released its latest intelligence report, saying Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol. The report reads: Despite heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol. Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have endured yet another day of limited progress with most forces largely stalled in place. Several Ukrainian cities continue to suffer heavy Russian air and artillery bombardment with the UN reporting that more than 10 million Ukrainians are now internally displaced as a result of Russia’s invasion.” A superyacht linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was nearing the Turkish tourist resort of Marmaris on Tuesday, ship tracking data showed, a day after another yacht linked to him docked in the resort of Bodrum, also in southwest Turkey, according to a Reuters report. The yacht Eclipse was heading in the direction of Marmaris, about 3km (1.9 miles) from its port after cruising southeast of the Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, according to Marine Traffic data. The data also showed the 140-metre (460-foot) superyacht Solaris remained moored in Bodrum, some 80km (50 miles) away, having skirted the waters of European Union countries which have sanctioned the oligarch over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There was no indication that Abramovich was aboard either of the vessels. He was among several wealthy Russians added last week to a European Union blacklist, and EU governments have acted in recent days to seize yachts and other luxury assets from them. US President Joe Biden has said only India among the Quad group of countries was “somewhat shaky” in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, as India tries to balance its ties with Russia and the west. While the other Quad countries - the United States, Japan and Australia - have sanctioned Russian entities or people, India has not imposed sanctions or even condemned Russia, its biggest supplier of military hardware. Biden told a Business Roundtable event on Monday: In response to his aggression, we have presented a united front throughout the Nato and in the Pacific. The Quad - with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of these - but Japan has been extremely strong, so is Australia in terms of dealing with Putin’s aggression.” After a virtual summit between Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, on Monday, India’s foreign ministry said Australia understood India’s position on Ukraine, which “reflected our own situation, our own considerations”, according to a Reuters report. India still depends on Russia for a continuous supply of arms and ammunition amid a Himalayan border standoff with China and tension with Pakistan. India is also considering buying more Russian oil at a discount, with two Indian state companies recently ordering 5m barrels. As Russia’s invasion against Ukraine rages on, many civilians have increased their war effort. In Zaporizhzhia, women are seen making steel vests for Ukrainian soldiers using scrap metals from cars. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is primarily Vladimir Putin’s war, but if there is a second man whose name and reputation will be tied to the devastation unleashed by Moscow it is Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. His fighters were part of the first wave assault on the country, and died in large numbers around the Hostomel airbase, with one key commander among those killed. Elite Chechen squads were also reportedly recruited for failed attempts to assassinate key Ukrainian leaders in the first 48 hours of the invasion, western intelligence said. More recently Kadyrov’s men have appeared among forces imposing a brutal siege on the port city of Mariupol, where targets have included a maternity hospital and the suffering of hundreds of thousands has become emblematic of Ukrainian pain. Read the full story below. The Ukrainian military claims its forces have retaken the town of Makariv, just 50km west of Kyiv. In an update provided by the general staff of the armed forces, officials said its forces pushed Russian troops out of the town. “Owing to counterattack ... the enemy is compelled to retreat to unfavourable borders. So, during the day, thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders, the state flag of Ukraine was raised over the city of Makarov, the enemy was rejected.” The alleged victory comes three days after a Russian mortar attack struck the town and killed seven people, according to local police. Russian forces bombed the Retroville shopping mall in the Podilsky district of Kyiv with a missile on Sunday night. Eight people were killed in the attack. It was the largest attack to hit the capital since the invasion began and targeted a brand new shopping centre, causing significant damage as well as to surrounding buildings and cars. Footage of the rescue operation can be viewed in the video below. The Ukrainian military has released its operational report as of 6am this morning, claiming Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days”. According to available information, the Russian occupation forces operating in Ukraine have stockpiles of ammunition and food for no more than three days.” Officials said the situation is similar with fuel and blamed Russia’s inability to organise a pipeline to meet the needs of troops as the reason behind the logistic failure. Citing a particular example in the Okhtyrka district of the Sumy oblast, Ukraine’s armed forces said “disobedience of Russian servicemen” led to about 300 servicemen who refused to carry out orders. And in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region, due to heavy losses of manpower, Ukraine said Russia “continues to mobilise citizens of the quasi-formation of the LPR” however “a large part of the population does not support the policy of the occupiers, does not want to take up arms and hides from the representatives of the occupying power.” It is significant that mobilisation is carried out chaotically, the people who are mobilised are not distributed by specialties, most of them have no military specialty, because they have never served in the military. Contracts are signed with citizens who have Russian passports, and those who have only a pseudo-republic passport are registered as volunteers.” In an earlier report, officials said Russian forces were holding the land corridor with Crimea and are blocking access to the Sea of Azov. The city of Sumy is also partially blocked while artillery shelling continues on the city of Kharkiv. Military officials said they estimate Russian lost about 300 personnel on Monday alone. “It is expected that the enemy will continue to launch insidious missile and bomb strikes and carry out artillery shelling of critical infrastructure of Ukraine using jet artillery, aircraft, high-precision weapons and indiscriminate munitions.” the report read. The Pentagon earlier accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, saying the Kremlin had carried out indiscriminate attacks as part of an intentional strategy in the conflict. “We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “But there’s investigative processes that are going to go on, and we’re going to let that happen. We’re going to contribute to that investigative process”. If you missed it earlier, watch Kirby’s remarks from the briefing in the video below. The Russian Embassy to the US has issued a response to Ukraine’s claim that Russian troops forced civilians in Mariupol across the border to Russian camps. The statement, issued at 10pm EST, reads: We paid attention to the statements of the Ukrainian authorities circulated in the US media about the alleged creation of ‘filtration camps’ by our military near Mariupol.” The embassy continued to claim that Russia is only operating checkpoints “to avoid diversion operations” by the Ukrainian military and to allow Russian forces to “carefully inspect motor vehicles heading to safe regions”. “The Russian military does not create any barriers for the civilian population, but helps to stay alive, provides them with food and medicine,” the statement added. The Ukrainian spirit of resistance and perseverance has awed the international community and many global leaders. In the photos below, two men meet to play a game of chess on a bench in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv while a young family prepares a meal outside a train station while waiting to travel to Poland. Russian accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons are false and illustrate that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself in his war against Ukraine, US President Joe Biden said on Monday, without citing evidence. Reuters reports Biden told at a Business Roundtable event on Monday: [Putin’s] back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe, simply not true. They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those.” The remarks echoed prior comments by officials in Washington and allied countries, who have accused Russia of spreading an unproven claim that Ukraine had a biological weapons program as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks. Russia’s defence ministry has accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, warning him of consequences for “any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.” The White House did not specify what those consequences would be. Satellite images show multiple explosions and rising smoke around an industrial compound in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. It is unclear when the area was struck. Hundreds of thousands of increasingly desperate people have been trapped in Mariupol, many without water, heat or power, for three weeks. Officials have said at least 2,300 have died. Reporters from Reuters who reached Mariupol on Monday described an “apocalyptic wasteland”, with bodies lying by the road in blankets, windows blasted out of charred apartment blocks, and groups of men digging graves by the roadside. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for direct talks with his Russian counterpart as the key to ending the war. Ukraine and Russia have held several rounds of talks via videoconferencing, but so far without a major breakthrough, and Zelenskiy reiterated that direct talks with his Russian counterpart “in any format” were now needed. Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” Zelenskiy said his country would be “destroyed” before it surrenders its cities to invading Russian forces. The Ukrainian president made clear his countrymen would not “hand over” the capital, the eastern city of Kharkiv, or the heavily bombarded and besieged Mariupol. Ukraine cannot fulfil Russian ultimatums. We should be destroyed first.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you and we unpack all the latest developments in Ukraine. Russia’s war on its neighbour is well into its fourth week. Casualties are in the thousands and millions have fled the country seeking refuge abroad. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged direct talks with Vladimir Putin, saying: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” He also said his country will never bow to ultimatums from Russia and cities directly under attack, including the capital, Kyiv, and Mariupol and Kharkiv would not accept Russian occupation. Russia’s false accusations that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a “clear sign” that Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself, Joe Biden said. “[Putin’s] back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags,” he said. The Pentagon has accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, saying there is “clear evidence” of such, and the spokesman of the US Defence Department said it would help gather evidence of them. Biden spoke after the Pentagon said it had seen “clear evidence” Russian forces were committing war crimes and that it was helping collect evidence. Biden also warned the US business community of intelligence pointing to a growing Russian cyber threat and urged companies to “immediately” prepare defences. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, heralded new plans to develop an “EU Rapid Deployment Capacity” that could allow the bloc to “swiftly deploy up to 5,000 troops” for different types of crises. He insisted a “European army” will not be created. Russia has threatened to cut ties with the US after Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a war criminal, claiming his comments “put Russian-American relations on the verge of a breach”. Almost 10,000 Russian soldiers may have already been killed in the war in Ukraine since Russia invaded almost four weeks ago, and more than 16,000 wounded, according to reports of previously-undisclosed figures from the defence ministry in Moscow revealed in a pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda. The paper later released a statement claiming it had been hacked. British prime minister Boris Johnson is “desperate” to go to Ukraine and has a “real emotional connection” with the Ukrainian people, the Tory party chair has claimed. It was reported at the weekend that Johnson wanted to go to Kyiv but on Monday No 10 sources indicated this was unlikely to happen. Some of Chernobyl’s exhausted workers have been permitted to leave the site. They have been on duty for the last three weeks since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuelling concerns about the site’s safety. The UK defence attaché has said Russia’s claims that it fired “hypersonic” missiles in western Ukraine is probably an effort to detract from the lack of progress in its ground campaign. In Kyiv, a brand new shopping centre was destroyed in a missile attack that killed at least eight people, the largest attack yet on the capital. The Ukrainian military said Russian forces hold the land corridor with Crimea and are blocking access to the Sea of Azov, according to a recent operational report. A total of 2,421 civilian casualties have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia invaded, including 925 killed and 1,496 injured, according to an update from the UN Human Rights office (OHCHR)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/may/02/tuesday-briefing-britain-unplugged-brexit-warning-over-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-02T05:04:48Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Britain unplugged?

Brexit warning over nuclear power","bodyText":"Top story: ‘UK nuclear industry at risk’ Hello, Warren Murray welcoming you back after the bank holiday. Let’s get on with it shall we? Britain’s power supply could be in jeopardy if it loses access to nuclear fuels and expertise because of Brexit, the government is being warned. Critics say the Tories have no coherent plan for what comes after the Euratom treaty, which governs safety standards, cooperation, research and trade in atomic energy across the EU. Cross-party MPs are warning that unless proper arrangements are made, Britain could be reduced to a “rule-taker”, forced to comply with European rules and standards without having any say in them. And the UK could end up running out of nuclear fuel for reactors that are relied upon heavily for electricity. “Decisive action must take place now,” says Justin Bowden from the GMB trade union. * * * Surfer’s survival – A surfer was found last night extremely cold but alive after surviving 32 hours adrift off the Scottish coast. Matthew Bryce, 22, was 13 miles from shore when he was spotted by a Coastguard helicopter still clinging to his board. He had last been seen at 9am on Sunday headed to Westport Beach. Bryce was taken to hospital in Belfast suffering from hypothermia. The Coastguard said his thick neoprene suit probably saved him. * * * Global politics wrapped up – To speed things along, here is a Trumpbrexilection update. Donald Trump wants to meet Kim Jong-un someday and doesn’t understand the American civil war. The president’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has seen fit to joke about bombing Syria, calling it the “after-dinner entertainment” for Xi Jinping’s visit. Things are hectic for busy mom Ivanka who tells how she can’t even get a massage sometimes. Experts in the House of Lords say “mercurial and unpredictable” Trump is useless when it comes to the Middle East and Britain needs to go it alone. Theresa May has tried to wash away the sour aftertaste of her dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker at which the EU supremo reportedly told her not to bother turning up to Brexit talks unless she brings the divorce settlement, and for afters described her as “deluded” and “on another galaxy”. Labour’s Keir Starmer says it all shows that if May wins the election she will continue negotiating us towards a disastrous EU exit. There you go, all done and dusted. Well almost … there’s more on the UK election in the Snap. Read to the bottom for details on how to subscribe. * * * ‘Bank of mum and dad’ – Parents are expected to lend £6.5bn to their first-time buyer children this year to help them get on the housing ladder. It’s 30% more than last year and illustrates the struggle caused by high prices in Britain’s “broken” housing market. Parents are now involved in 25% of UK property purchases, with millennials needing the most help, and £30,000 representing an average contribution in some areas. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of L&amp;G, says: “The problem is getting worse, not better … Younger people today don’t have the same opportunities that the baby boomers had, including affordable housing, defined benefit pensions and free university education.” * * * Bit less rich – Philip and Tina Green are the losers in this year’s Sunday Times list of Britain’s richest husbands and wives, with their wealth falling by £433m following the BHS pensions debacle. It’s consoling, though, that they are still the fifth richest pairing, worth an estimated £2.8bn. The couples list is topped by Ernesto and Kirsty Bertarelli, who have made £11.5bn in biotech and pharmaceuticals. The Hollywood actor Salma Hayek also makes an appearance – she is married to luxury fashions magnate François-Henri Pinault, and earns about £12m a year herself. Simultaneously, findings have come out showing that the number of high-income earners in the UK has risen by a million, but women have not increased as a proportion: 75% in the highest tax bracket are still men. * * * Lunchtime read: Where oil rigs go to die Disposing of these monsters of the sea is a fraught and risky business, as the world found out when the Transocean Winner, en route from Norway to Malta and beyond, broke its tow cable in stormy seas and ran aground on the Isle of Lewis. Tom Lamont traces the rig’s refloating and onward journey to its final resting place – along the way, examining an industry where the substantial risks of a long voyage are balanced against extracting every last dollar of scrap value by dragging these unwieldy beasts through the ocean to the country that will pay the highest price for their metal. Sport Mark Selby, completely unrecognisable from the player who trailed 10-4 at one stage during the world championship snooker final, recovered against John Higgins to win his third title in four years at the Crucible. Meanwhile, Barry Hearn has voiced his “disgust” at players who spurn 147 break opportunities, saying anyone who complains of the lack of financial incentive to score maximums should “get out of the sport”. Liverpool appear set to secure a Champions League place after a 1-0 win at Watford thanks to Emre Can’s stunning bicycle kick, even if they showed familiar flaws at Vicarage Road. Paula Radcliffe and Jonathan Edwards have reacted with incredulity and dismay to news that all athletics world and European records before 2005 are likely to be stripped from the record books. The beleaguered Team Sky have suffered another body blow in their attempts to rebuild their brand after they suspended Gianni Moscon for six weeks for racially abusing another rider. And Ben Stokes hit his maiden Twenty20 century despite battling cramp in his calf to lead Rising Pune Supergiant to victory against Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League. Business News is breaking this morning that Greece has reached a deal on a package of bailout-mandated reforms with its foreign creditors. It should pave the way for long-awaited debt relief talks. Reuters reports that the deal includes labour and energy reforms as well as pension cuts and tax rises and “marks a milestone in talks between the two sides which began last October”. Overnight the pound was buying US$1.29 and €1.18. The papers The Mirror says Spanish hoteliers might ban Britons from staying because they are putting in so many compensation claims for food poisoning. The Sun reports that a man jailed for his part in the 1980 siege of the Iranian embassy in London is now out of prison and living on benefits. The Times has a splash that claims the car loans market is heading toward a mis-selling scandal with fears about the reliance on debt to buy 90% of new cars. The Mail has an investigation headlined “Exploited by cash-for-eggs IVF clinics” about women on low incomes being offered free treatment if they give up the right to half the eggs produced. The Telegraph tries to hit back at the recent leaks about May’s conversations with top EU officials over Brexit – it thunders that the EU has been “plotting” to block the PM’s plans to secure a deal for expats. The paper offers up what it says is evidence of the plot. The FT says Brussels is poised for a power grab on London’s euro-clearing market, with the European commission preparing to severely restrict the capital’s ability to host its flagship business.

I’m Warren Murray and there is plenty here to chew on. Donald Trump was unaware that the UK had nuclear weapons, according to his former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book The Room Where it Happened has been released in excerpts to the media just as the president tries to block its publication. Trump pleaded with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to help him get re-elected; encouraged China’s concentration camps for more than a million Muslims – which have led to US sanctions – as exactly the right thing to do; and was willing to halt criminal investigations to “give personal favours to dictators he liked”, Bolton writes. Bolton describes a pattern of corruption in which Trump routinely attempts to use the leverage of US power on other countries to his personal ends. “The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn’t accept,” Bolton writes, adding that he took his concerns to the attorney general, William Barr. Trump refused to issue a statement commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, saying “That was 15 years ago” (it was the 30th anniversary). Bolton’s book quotes Trump as saying that invading Venezuela would be “cool” and that it was “really part of the United States”. It says the summit diplomacy with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, was intended as spectacle, with Trump happy to “sign a substance-free communique, have his press conference to declare victory, and then get out of town”. Mike Pompeo mocked the president behind his back, slipping Bolton a note saying: “He is so full of shit.” The Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, points out: “Bolton does not emerge from his time in office or the ensuing months as an icon of public virtue. If he had agreed to testify before the House impeachment hearings, he would have raised the alarm over the presidential abuses he now says so disturbed him, and just maybe something could have been done about it. It is hard to see his refusal as anything other than to keep the best material for his $2m book deal.” Unsurprisingly Trump has said on social media that the book was “made up of lies &amp; fake stories” and called Bolton a “disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war”. * * * Rhodes statue review – Late yesterday the governing body of Oriel College at Oxford voted in tacit support of removing a statue of the Cecil Rhodes but deferred the matter to an independent commission of inquiry. The pub chain and brewer Greene King and the insurance market Lloyd’s of London both revealed last night that in light of their historic connections to the slave trade, they will be making reparations via charitable donations, company practices and investment in creating opportunities and inclusion for BAME groups. A black nurse who holds the British Empire Medal is taking civil action against the Met after she was hauled from her car, searched and held in a cell for 18 hours despite having done nothing wrong. Neomi Bennett – who featured on Dragon’s Den after inventing a device for putting on deep-vein thrombosis stockings – is taking civil action against the Met. Her conviction for obstructing the police has already been overturned. In the US, the Atlanta officer who fatally shot a fleeing Rayshard Brooks in the back is to face 11 charges including felony murder. Brooks, who was black, posed no threat when he was shot, prosecutors say. * * * After Covid, a climate catastrophe? – The world has only six months to prevent a post-lockdown “carbon rebound” that would overwhelm efforts to stave off climate catastrophe, an International Energy Agency expert warns. Governments are planning to spend $9tn (£7.2tn) globally in the next few months to fire up their economies, and Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, says far too little of this is being channelled to carbon-cutting industries. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than half a trillion dollars worldwide – $509bn – will be poured straight into high-carbon industries such as airlines. “The next three years will determine the course of the next 30 years and beyond,” Birol told the Guardian. In Britain, the Lib Dems have unveiled proposals to invest £150bn in green projects over three years, calling the coronavirus recovery “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to both tackle potential mass unemployment and reshape the economy on environmental lines. A fresh coronavirus case has been reported in New Zealand as officials scramble to contain the fallout from Tuesday’s embarrassing revelations of a quarantine breach and reports of people disappearing after leaving isolation early. Police said six people absconded from managed isolation after being granted compassionate leave. (In yesterday’s email briefing we said in error that two new cases were Britons – in fact they were New Zealanders returning from Britain.) And Beijing’s cluster of new cases may have begun a month earlier than first thought, partly due to asymptomatic infections, according to the director of China’s infectious diseases authority. Keep tabs on our global live blog for the latest coronavirus news. There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Phone trawling by police criticised – Police in England and Wales are extracting “excessive amounts of personal data” from the mobile phones of victims and witnesses, which can discourage the public from reporting crime, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has warned. It says individuals’ mobile phones “hold the most intimate and private details of our everyday lives”. Rape investigations are being systematically dropped after victims refuse to hand over their phones for analysis, an investigation by the campaign group Big Brother Watch suggests. Freedom of information requests revealed that about one in five complainants declined to submit to a “digital strip search” and every such case was closed. Campaigners are calling for change to this “all or nothing” approach. The National Police Chiefs’ Council argues police have a duty to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry, meet evidence disclosure obligations and prepare a strong case for prosecutors. * * * British air power – Construction is beginning on the world’s largest liquid air battery, which will store renewable electricity and reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants. The facility developed by Highview Power is due to be operational in 2022 and will be able to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours, and store energy for many weeks. The project near Manchester will use spare green energy to compress air into a liquid and store it. When demand is higher the liquid air is released back into a gas, powering a turbine that puts the green energy back into the grid. Coronavirus Extra The pandemic has devastated global tourism, and many will say good riddance to overcrowded cities and rubbish-strewn natural wonders. Is there any way to reinvent an industry that does so much damage? England’s charity shops have embraced the new normal – after all, many of us have missed the likes of Scope just as much as Primark or John Lewis. Sam Wollaston spend a day with happily returning customers, donors and staff. Today in Focus podcast: Stranded at sea Guardian US reporter Erin McCormick describes why thousands of crew are still stuck on cruise ships after coronavirus bought the industry to a standstill in March. Will Lees describes how it took him 82 days to get back to Canada while Perry, who hasn’t had a salary since March, is still stuck and doesn’t know when he will get home to his family in Mauritius. Lunchtime read: Bravery of Noor Inayat Khan She was the daughter of an Indian Sufi mystic, who gave her life as a British agent fighting with the French resistance and for the cause of freedom. Now, 76 years after 29-year-old Noor Inayat Khan was captured by the Gestapo and executed in the Dachau concentration camp, a previously unpublished account reveals that it was her love of the colour blue that betrayed her to the enemy. Sport Kevin De Bruyne ran the show and David Luiz’s disastrous appearance off the bench contributed to Manchester City’s 3-0 win over Arsenal as the Premier League made a largely successful return. But the makers of the goal-line technology issued an apology after the earlier 0-0 draw between Aston Villa and Sheffield United descended into farce when a goal was disallowed because cameras failed to spot the ball crossing the line. The 2020 US Open will start behind closed doors on 31 August but there is still no guarantee the best tennis players in the world will be there. Winner of two titles at Flushing Meadows, Dylan Alcott, has called the decision to omit wheelchair tennis from this year’s coronavirus-compromised grand slam “disgusting discrimination”. Rory McIlroy has risked rancour on the fairways by insisting he has no sympathy for European players who have opted not to earn world ranking points during the PGA Tour’s restart. The world 100m champion Christian Coleman has been told that going on a Christmas shopping trip is no defence for missing a drugs test under World Anti-Doping Agency rules. On the same day that the Los Angeles Chargers head coach said teams would be “crazy” not to look at Colin Kaepernick in the run-up to the new NFL season, Donald Trump said he would support the quarterback returning to the league. And the pilot of the helicopter that crashed in thick fog, killing Kobe Bryant and seven other passengers, reported at the time he was climbing when he was actually descending. Business Shares have fallen in the Asia-Pacific region as markets eased off following their big rally. Sydney’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 skidded 1% after the government said unemployment had surpassed 7% and would have been above 9% if the figure included people laid off and not officially looking for work. At time of writing the pound is worth $1.255 and €1.155 while the FTSE is trending lower by about 50 points. The papers “Rhodes must fall – Oxford college backs campaign to remove statue” – the main story today on the Guardian’s front page, which also features “Schools to hire private tutors to aid pupils” – the programme covering England will be government-funded. Mastery of understatement is displayed by the Times which calls trump “uninformed” after he asked if Britain was a nuclear power. That’s across the top of the front – the lead story is “Doctors demand schools reopen” as paediatricians warn a generation’s life chances are being scarred. The Mirror demands: “Get our children back to school” while the Telegraph puts a royal seal on the issue: “Charles – young face devastation from virus”. “VITAMIN D NEW HOPE IN THE WAR ON CORONA” – between the all-caps and the squeeze on the Mail headline, the Briefing wondered for a moment where this “Vitamind” substance might be purchased. Here’s what it is really about. The FT has “US scuppers global digital tax plan and fires warning to Europe”. The i and the Express cover the potential end of triple-lock pension increases. The Metro reports on “PM’s £1m paint job” – the red, white and blue makeover for his official jet – and ties it in with a picture of his car, also in need of some rattle-can therapy after it sustained a tail-end shunt while leaving parliament.

Mike Bradley Ackley Bridge 8pm, Channel 4 It’s community cohesion in action (emphasis on the “action”) in this eventful new series of the Yorkshire secondary school drama. The education trust that took over at the end of last series has dumped a load of new pupils on headteacher, Mandy (Jo Joyner), and her new senior management team (including Downton Abbey’s Robert James-Collier) are not much help, either.

Ellen E Jones Secrets of the Railways 8pm, Yesterday Railway architecture may seem a little niche, but this engaging series ventures into history, too.

Mike Bradley Autobahn 10pm, Quest No matter how much jokey banjo music you incorporate, injecting fun into a plodding film about motorway maintenance on Germany’s autobahns will always be an uphill task.

Here is a rundown of the day’s biggest developments: Barnaby Joyce has acknowledged that Scott Morrison can commit Australia to a new net zero target without the endorsement of the Nationals’ party room, as the junior Coalition partner continues to internally debate its climate stance. Gladys Berejiklian expressed an “inclination to support” a $5.5m grant for a shooting complex in Wagga Wagga which her then-secret boyfriend Daryl Maguire had been personally lobbying for, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has heard. The former Victorian Labor minister Adem Somyurek and his political protégé accused journalists of racism in an effort to stop them from investigating taxpayer-funded grants awarded to their factional allies, an inquiry has heard. The mother of four-year-old Cleo Smith says she woke to find the tent open and her daughter missing, along with her sleeping bag, on the morning she vanished from a popular Western Australian campsite. Daniel Andrews has warned that unvaccinated Victorians could face restrictions well into next year as the state prepares to open up this weekend. Almost half of $60.2bn in federal government grants awarded over the past four years has not gone through a competitive open tender process, a new report on federal grant spending has found. Emma Watkins, the first female Wiggle, has confirmed she will leave the Wiggles at the end of the year, spurred by a lockdown epiphany. Watkins says she is leaving to focus on her family and PhD. Have a great evening. We’ll be back to do it all again tomorrow. The mother of four-year-old Cleo Smith says she woke to find the tent open and her daughter’s sleeping bag missing the morning they discovered her disappearance from a popular Western Australian campsite. Ellie Smith said she had barely slept since her daughter’s disappearance, calling for her safe return after searches entered the fourth day. “Everyone asks us what we need and all we need is our little girl home,” she said in an interview reported by the ABC on Tuesday. The family had arrived at the Blowholes campsite at Macleod, on the north-west coast of Western Australia, on Friday about 6.30pm. Smith said Cleo went to bed about 8pm after dinner before the rest of their family, including her sister Isla. On Tuesday the Labor caucus decided to block the government’s Coag reform bill if the section extending secrecy to the national cabinet is not removed. The Coalition wants to protect national cabinet secrecy after losing to Rex Patrick in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which found the intergovernmental body is not a committee of the commonwealth cabinet. The bill is in serious trouble, even Liberal senator Gerard Rennick has said he will vote against it, as has independent Jacqui Lambie. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reported back on the bill today. The government-controlled committee wants it passed, but Labor has dissented. In their report Labor senators said: “Secrecy has been a foundational feature of National Cabinet, just like the Morrison Government. Since it was established the Morrison Government has withheld information from the Parliament and the public on the spurious grounds National Cabinet is part of the Commonwealth Cabinet.The tentacles of National Cabinet secrecy have extended without justification to other bodies which pre-dated National Cabinet including the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). The decision to treat documents previously published by AHPPC as Cabinet-in-Confidence upon the creation of National Cabinet has diminished public knowledge and buttressed the ability of dangerous fools to spread misinformation about Australia’s public health response during the pandemic.” Labor senators concluded that if national cabinet were really a part of the commonwealth cabinet there would be no need for the bill. The Covid-19 outbreak inside Melbourne’s Park hotel – an alternative place of detention for more than 40 refugees and asylum seekers – has grown to at least nine confirmed cases, sources inside the hotel say, but could be as many as 20. More than a dozen refugees and asylum seekers are still waiting for test results after more than two days. Video of a heated confrontation in a corridor of the Park hotel was posted online. Officials in full PPE are seen talking to asylum seekers and refugees who are asking to be taken out of the hotel as the virus spreads. “In this pandemic we’re at a point where everyone is going to get it eventually,” one official says, “so we’ve got to do what we can do.” For months, refugees and asylum seekers have warned that an outbreak of Covid-19 would spread rapidly within hotel detention, because of low vaccination rates (the vaccination program for those in detention started later than that in the broader community) and the compromised health of many of those held in detention. Most of those in the Park hotel were moved to Australia from offshore detention islands in PNG and Nauru under the medevac laws because of acute healthcare needs. The majority have been in detention more than eight years. Also exacerbating the risk is the unavoidable confinement of hotel detention, including shared sleeping, eating and limited recreation spaces. There is also some hesitancy towards vaccinations because of low levels of trust in the government and its detention health provider, International Health and Medical Services. Last year, more than 1,180 health professionals signed an open letter to the government called for the men to be released, saying the makeshift detention centres were “a very high-risk environment” for transmission. Confirmed positive cases are being moved to the first floor of the hotel. One of the cases confirmed on Sunday has been taken to hospital. Foreign spies are “threatening to physically harm” members of diaspora communities in Australia, according to the head of intelligence agency Asio. Mike Burgess, the director general of security, raised the concern in Asio’s latest annual report, which was tabled in parliament today. Without naming any country, Burgess wrote that espionage and foreign interference attempts “by multiple countries” remained “unacceptably high”. These attempts occur on a daily basis. They are sophisticated and wide-ranging. They are enabled and accelerated by technology. And they take place in every state and territory, targeting all levels of government, as well as industry and academia. Foreign spies are attempting to obtain classified information about Australia’s trade relationships, defence and intelligence capabilities. They are seeking to develop targeted relationships with current and former politicians, and current and former security-clearance holders. They are monitoring diaspora communities in Australia and, in some cases, threatening to physically harm members of these communities. Burgess also wrote that he was “concerned about the potential for Australia’s adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure, particularly in areas such as telecommunications and energy”. Such activities “could be used to damage critical networks in the future”. But he said Asio and law-enforcement partners had achieved “a significant reduction in the number of foreign spies and their proxies operating in Australia”. Again, without going into detail, he said visas had been cancelled and spy networks dismantled. Burgess reaffirmed his recent comments that Asio anticipated that espionage and foreign interference “will supplant terrorism as Australia’s principal security concern over the next five years”. He also said terrorism was “an ongoing and evolving challenge”, with the national terrorism threat level remaining at “probable”. Religiously motivated violent extremists want to kill Australians. Groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) continue to urge attacks, 24 convicted terrorism offenders are eligible for release over the next 10 years, and some battle-hardened foreign fighters may yet return to Australia. At the same time, our investigations into ideologically motivated violent extremists, such as racist and nationalist violent extremists, have grown. During 2020–21, these investigations approached 50% of our onshore priority counter-terrorism caseload. One of the most concerning aspects of these investigations is the growing number of young people — predominantly young men — who are being radicalised by these ideologies. Police divers have found a speargun and other gear belonging to a missing fisherman on the bottom of the sea near Cairns, reports AAP. The 26-year-old failed to return to his boat at Sudbury Reef on Saturday afternoon. A companion raised the alarm and police carried out an extensive search over more than 135 sq km. Sen Const Matt Cornish said on Tuesday that the man’s speargun and other diving equipment had been found on the sea floor. The items that were located by police divers on Sunday afternoon were in close vicinity of the boat, which was still anchored there. A report will be prepared for the coroner. New South Wales’ vaccine rollout continues to grow. 92.3% of residents over 16 have had one dose 81.6% of people are now fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the Australian Capital Territory has a slight edge over NSW, with a double dose rate of 81.7%. Nationally, the second-dose coverage is hovering just under 70%. The parliament shenanigans are winding down, so I am going to hand you over to the wonderful Elias Visontay for the evening. He’ll take you through what else is going on as the day winds to a close and his brain is still firing on all cylinders, so you are all much better off. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, who is still walking the hallways and to Murph, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst for all they have done today to make everything make sense. And for listening to my never ending rants. As always though, the biggest thank you is to all of you. We very much appreciate you joining us each day. You may have noticed a bit of a shift in the Nationals language today (Matt Canavan not included) and Barnaby Joyce dropping in the “end of the week” line for a response in question time, so maybe, just maybe, we will have a resolution to the 2050 net zero target soonish. 2030 though? That’s a battle for another time. Like the election. We will be back early tomorrow morning where we will bring you all of the updates as they come. Stay tuned to what Elias has for you now, and be sure to check back for what the team have written up for the day. And most importantly – take care of you. AAP has what the Queensland CHO Jeannette Young said about the Queensland vaccination program: Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young says unvaccinated people have 12 days left to get their first jab if they want the vaccine to reach full efficacy by December 17. “You’ve got, as the premier said, 12 days to do it, because after that we will be bringing in virus through the borders in vaccinated people,” she told reporters on Tuesday. “We know that once you’re vaccinated you still can get infected and transmit it, but you’re very unlikely to get unwell, very unlikely you’re going to end up in hospital. “So every single Queenslander is going to get exposed to the COVID-19 virus, and we’ll get infected, but if you’re vaccinated, that’s not a problem.” Given we are hearing about this industry non-stop at the moment, it is worth having a look at what numbers we are talking about in the workforce: Dorinda Cox is about to deliver her first speech in the Senate. This on the other hand, is worth your time Shock, horror – Matt Canavan is still against net zero by 2050. This time, because he is an economist by trade and he knows how modelling works: As someone who has done economic modelling, I know you can get whatever result you like. What is important is the assumptions you put into it. That is what you need to be given because that is how you determine its veracity and accuracy and reliability. None of that information has been provided to us and I certainly believe that the government should release all of the detail. The Rudd and Gillard governments did that in their climate package and the Morrison government did the same. There was modelling done by a respected modeller. I do not even know who has done this modelling let alone what assumptions and import they have used. It seems quite fantastical that we would completely change the whole Australian economy and there would be no impact, effectively. They goes against all modelling that has ever been done on a net zero emissions including those done in the UK and New Zealand so I do think it is important that the government releases it [so] we can see the detail. Matt Canavan is breaking his (two minute) silence to once again let the world know his very closely held views on net zero emissions targets on the ABC. Which is lucky. Because I had really begun to wonder in those two minutes JUST WHAT IS CANAVAN’S POSITION. The National Farmers’ Federation president, Fiona Simson is having a chat to Afternoon Briefing, where she was asked what she and the NFF spoke to the Nationals party about in the climate briefing: We talked to the National party about the opportunities for our industry. To be honest, I think most farmers now are just very pragmatic about this, we haven’t drunk any cordial, we are not lefties or righties or whatever, we are on the front-end of a rapidly changing climate, we are experiencing that ourselves in the last decade with a terrible drought and some of the extreme weather conditions we are having and we are on the pointy end when it comes to international policies, and clearly climate change is something the global community is taking very seriously. We are extremely trade exposed here in Australia, in agriculture, we export 70% of what we produce. We are feeling really vulnerable without a target, because that leaves us open to tariff action, border adjustment mechanisms such as we have seen proposed by Europe, even though their own agricultural industry is exempt from any of their targets so far. So we made it clear, and making it clear in fact to anybody we are talking to that we just want to set the target give us some certainty, we want every part of the economy to be doing their bit. We also want to make sure we have the pathway for our industry and some recognition of the contribution we have up-to-date as we map the growth of our industry over the next 30 years, the growth of the best food and fibre industry in the world and how we marry that with environmental sustainability and a lower emissions economy. Good news for Victorians: There was some confusion earlier in the day over a contribution made by the Liberal senator, Gerard Rennick, in the joint party room about Queensland border closures. Rennick has since told the Guardian he asked the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to challenge the state’s border closures in the high court, arguing that 8,000 Queenslanders could not return home, and the strict border controls could no longer be considered reasonable. He said Cash and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, needed to go to the high court “as a matter of urgency”. “Queenslanders should be able to go home, subject to a negative covid test,” Rennick said. “The prime minister has to be seen to be defending the constitution, which is what unites us all.” Rennick said that while it “was not Scott’s fault” that Annastacia Palaszczuk had instituted the border restrictions, he said the prime minister “needs to fix it”. He said that he would be prepared to withhold his vote in the Senate on critical legislation “until Morrison sorts it out”, but would not interfere with procedural motions. “If that is what it takes, then yes,” Rennick said. “The prime minister needs to get on the phone and tell the premiers to pull their heads in as they are out of control, and it is an overreach of their powers, and we need to go to the high court as a matter of urgency and clarify what it means to close the borders and the question of reasonableness.” It was a very animated QT for some. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for QT. He caught some lovely “we are best friends” moments. Labor national secretary, Paul Erickson, has responded to the Victorian supreme court rejecting two challenges to the federal intervention into the Victorian branch. Erickson told Guardian Australia: This decision is important confirmation of the power of the national executive to enforce our rules and stamp out bad behaviour. Anthony Albanese has been clear he expects the national executive to continue [this work] including acting on any [Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission] recommendations and findings.” Question time ends. Thankfully. Barnaby Joyce on why he is dragging out the inevitable on a 2050 net zero target: That process continues on and we will make sure that the prime minister of the commonwealth of Australia has a response from us for by the end of this week as to what we see as the pertinent issues and to have further discussion. This is not grandstanding. This is not ransom that has been put forward by so many people. This is making sure that we do our job and we will continue to do our job. Again, Joyce has been in governing coalition for eight years. He has been part of the executive, who makes decisions for the government, for most of those. Just a few weeks ago, he was pretending that the executive doesn’t come up with plans. Now he is the patient, sensible centre. Alan Tudge gets a dixer on childcare and opens with: He [the MP] knows, as we all do in this place, how important childcare is, particularly for our parents who go to the paid workforce if they indeed want to do that. Yes, that very niche group of parents who must work to support their family. Scott Morrison is really hoping these focus group lines take off. We are putting downward pressure on emissions and the record of those opposite is that they drove them up with their carbon tax and they made Australians pay for their policies. On this side of the house, Mr Speaker, our policies are about taking the burdens off. Our policies are about doing the right thing by rural and regional Australia and households, Mr Speaker, so they can have the choices that they want to have so that they can plan for their future with confidence. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, want to sign Australia up with a blank cheque and no plan and make Australians pay for it. Josh Frydenberg can’t answer a dixer without running through an MP’s LinkedIn bio, but Barnaby Joyce can’t answer any question without listing off as many places as he can from that “I’ve been everywhere” song. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Yesterday the deputy prime minister said that a net zero emissions 2050 target could not be legislated because of the impact on Australia if the target was not met. Does this not show that this is another announcement that the prime minister has no intention of delivering? Morrison: Australia made the commitment to Kyoto, the same basis that we made a commitment to Paris and the same basis we would take anything forwarded to Glasgow and the proof of our record is we have met Kyoto one (which allowed Australia to increase emissions), we have met Kyoto two, we are going to meet our Paris 2030 and in fact beat our Paris 2030 (not exactly) The leader of the opposition seems to confuse the processes that he wishes to engage in is having some material impact on what the outcome will be. Australians understand outcomes. And the outcomes are that under our government, emissions are falling. They are going down, emissions have fallen by 20% and more on 2005 levels*, they are lower and it’s not the only thing that is lower. Unemployment is lower**, youth unemployment is lower, the level of investment in this country is greater, there are more Australians working in manufacturing today, and there were less under the Labor party when they were in power (it was the GFC). We have got big resources projects happening around the country, we are seeing our LNG industry going from strength to strength, being world leading at the same time, our policies are reducing emissions. Outcomes count. Not broad rhetorical statements from politicians. Outcomes count. And so let me remind the House of the few outcomes, 20% reduction in emissions, 69.2% of Australians aged over 16 vaccinated, the lowest rate of mortality for Covid of almost any country in the world (because borders were shut and quarantine programs were established – both at the pushing of the states). One of the lowest unemployment rates in more than a decade (again, because so many people have just given up looking for jobs and have dropped out of the labour force and therefore aren’t counted). They are the results that the Labor party don’t want to speak about. *Emissions have only dipped in the seven years the Coalition has been in power and the bulk of the reduction happened before 2013 under Labor. The overwhelming majority of this was due not to a reduction in fossil fuel use, but a substantial drop in land-clearing and forest destruction in Queensland under changes brought in by the state Labor government, a decline in native forestry and forest regeneration in some semi-arid areas. **Because so many people have dropped out of the labour force and are not counted in unemployment figures. Dugald (Milton) Dick to Scott Morrison: When the Prime Minister arrives in Glasgow in a fortnight’s time, will he tell the meeting “electric vehicles will end the weekend”, “batteries to store energy are as useful as the big banana and the big prawn” and ‘renewable energy targets are nuts’. Morrison: Mr Speaker, I don’t accept the caricature that the member has put forward. It is a complete misrepresentation which I’m completely used to from the Labor party, Mr Speaker, they can treat the parliament that way and treating it like a comedy act but these are very serious issues. While Labor seeks to joke about the policy, Mr Speaker, the government is focused very clearly on the decisions we have to make about what is going to impact on the livelihoods and lives of Australians over the next 30 years. And, Mr Speaker, we’re not taking an approach those opposite. They just signed up, Mr Speaker, with a blank cheque ... Labor tries to object that he is straying off the topic, but Tony Smith says given the way the question was phrased he has room to move. Morrison: The commitment to net zero 2050 is a serious matter. It will have big impact on big opportunities for Australia in the future. You don’t just sign up to it without a plan which is what I said from this dispatch box on many occasions. You don’t sign Australia up to something like that unless you carefully consider what the plan is and what the impact of that plan is. We have been going through that very exercise very seriously as a cabinet, as a Coalition government, as a serious government does to make these important decisions. We understand this that the global changes happening in our economy because of the response to climate change, that will have impacts that are adverse in Australia in rural and regional areas in particular. That is going to occur, and our plans are desired to address that, and to recognise the opportunities that can be gained from the changes that are occurring around the world, to ensure Australia can emerge more strongly based on the plans we are working on. That is how we are coming to conclude this issue. We came to this plan without any estimate, they claim some modelling, but that modelling assumes a carbon price, it assumes a carbon tax, and that is where the Labor party is at. We are doing this on the basis of careful consideration of the impacts of Australia’s IR decision. This is one of the biggest decisions our country has to make and we will make a carefully. We will make it collaboratively and we will be listening to Australians as we have done over the course of this term to prepare for this very moment to ensure that we consider this issue we can do so in a way where we can position Australia strongly for the future. This is about an economic plan that gets Australia through one of these great challenges. We will have such a plan, we have such a plan, and the admissions technology plan already set out which of those opposite, even right now in the Senate are seeking to disallow,* a regulation which would see us be able to invest in clean energy technologies in carbon capture storage and they are opposing ... (he runs out of time). *The changes the government has made to Arena funding means it will be able to finance fossil fuel projects. Not something the renewable energy fund was set up for. Given this is coming up a bit, here is an article from Adam Morton on the UK energy crisis: Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: The government has been in office for nearly a decade and the COP26 conference in Glasgow starts in just two weeks. After a decade, nearly a decade, how much longer is it going to take the prime minister to come up with a climate policy? Morrison: A 20% reduction in emissions, Mr Speaker, since 2005 which is the product, Mr Speaker, of the policies that we have put in place, Mr Speaker, particularly over these last eight years that has ensured, Mr Speaker, that has ensured, Mr Speaker, that we have been able to see technologies realise, that we’ve seen we have been able to drive down those emissions while stabilising and reducing electricity prices and keeping the lights on, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, the world knows what our 2030 commitments are, we signed up to them, I took them to the last election, Mr Speaker, and the Australian people endorsed them, I said we would meet them and we would beat them. And we will meet them and we will beat them based on the technologies we pursue. Not tax. The work we have done in the agricultural community and I’m sure we can add to more of these was not our policies, Mr Speaker, are reducing emissions. Our policies are reducing emissions and at the same time, Mr Speaker, we have realised one of the most significant expansions in our LNG industry (a fossil fuel) that we’ve ever seen, Mr Speaker and at the same time we have seen the number of people in manufacturing go up as opposed to under Labor and one in eight manufacturing jobs were lost. (It was the GFC and it was under the Coalition that the car manufacturing industry was lost) So under our policies, Mr Speaker, we are getting emissions down, we are getting solar panels on people’s homes, we are seeing record investments in renewable energy, we’re getting Australians into manufacturing jobs, we are expanding our resources industries and that is what the my Coalition’s plans are doing and we intend to keep doing that as we pursue policies in this area which ensure we do the right thing by jobs, we do the right thing by the environment, we do the right thing by our national energy security, Mr Speaker, that ensures that Australians can look forward to their future with confidence among whether they are living in the Hunter, Mr Speaker, or the south coast of New South Wales or out in Portland, Mr Speaker, where we have ensured that the aluminium smelter will continue to run and support those jobs, Mr Speaker. That is what our energy emissions reductions and environmental policies are achieving for Australia. And we will continue to make decisions in that vein. We will continue to do that, Mr Speaker, and we will not be taxing our way there. That is the approach of the Labor party and that is what they pursued when they were last in government, that is their approach, taxes not technology, Mr Speaker. We are technology not taxes. That is how we get the ourselves to achieve these goals, that is how we can make our way through the very difficult global economic challenges that will confront Australia over the next 30 years. We have been careful in considering each of these because we are mindful of the impact it can have on rural and regional areas. We haven’t signed Australia up with lank commitments like those opposite have... He runs out of time. The Victorian supreme court has given judgment in two cases seeking to challenge the federal Labor party’s intervention in the Victorian branch over branch-stacking allegations. Both cases have failed, meaning the national executive’s decisions to appoint administrators and take control of preselections have been upheld. The cases were brought by Victorian MP and former Andrews government minister, Marlene Kairouz and by the Health Services Union’s Diana Asmar, after a 60 Minutes episode exposed allegations of branch stacking leading to Anthony Albanese and the national executive intervening in the branch. In a summary of his judgment, Justice Tim Ginnane said he had decided that the claims the intervention was an unlawful interference with the Victorian branch’s trust property is the sort of dispute the court can hear. But Ginnane said that Kairouz had not “proved or established” her claim the national executive had inappropriately interfered in the management of branch trusts. He disagreed with her claim the federal party is a separate entity that cannot interfere in the branch. Likewise, he found the plaintiffs in the Asmar case had failed on the same grounds. Ginnane said the other grounds of challenge were “not justiciable”, meaning they “are not claims of the kind the court will become involved or will decide”. He said: It is not the role of this court to decide if disciplinary charges [against Kairouz] have substance, I note that she denies them.” Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: My question is given to the deputy prime minister and minister for regional development. I refer to his previous answer about the modelling of net zero by 2050 on regions in which he said, “It has an impact on the price of commodities”, what is that impact? Joyce: Mr Speaker, it is quite obvious that if the world is going where it is going, I think even ... (Labor MPs laugh). I don’t know what is so funny about that. It’s hilarious, isn’t it? (He is being sarcastic) ... Modelling of course is the best estimation. It is not written on tablets of stone but that estimation would naturally point to a change in demand which would reflect a change in price. So in the results of the modelling, the results of the modelling which we have seen, the results of the modelling which we have seen, it shows a downturn in coal price, coal commodities, was up and I don’t know what is remarkable about that. I understand the tactics of the Labor party is to try and trip me up but you have to try and sharpen that process a little bit. Albanese: I’m asking that the deputy prime minister table the modelling that he was referring to in his answer. Tony Smith: You can’t make that request, you can do it by a question, you can only ask to table a document he was reading from and he wasn’t reading from any document. Anthony Albanese to Barnaby Joyce: My question is to the deputy prime minister and the minister for regional water development. Has the minister seen any modelling which shows the economic impact of net zero by 2050 for the region? What does the modelling say about the economic impact on regional Australia? Joyce: I thank the honorable member for his question and yes, at this point in time we are working very diligently and very closely through so many aspects of the issue of 2050 because that it is incumbent upon us to make sure we look after the people of Aubrey and Singleton and make sure we do the right thing by the people of Nowra and Queanbeyan. We are working very diligently to make sure that we look after people from Busselton to Mount Eliza, that people in Aubrey and Wodonga and to that purpose we are going to every aspect of the plan that has been delivered to us and we are making sure that we come up with the right capacity to go back to the people whether it is in the seat of Cowan or in the seat of Flynn, whether... Tony Burke: The question goes to whether he has seen modelling and the impact on the regions, regions, not to read the table of contents from an atlas. Tony Smith: The substantive part of the manager of opposition point of order which was not the last part, the question does ask, it is very specific, the deputy prime minister has been entitled to give some context, which he has done, and he is not even one minute in course that can’t be the entirety of his answer. Joyce: Mr Speaker I respect your ruling but I would note how dismissive the Labor party are of regional towns, how dismissive they are of regional towns, how they smirk and snigger. Smith: You need to return to the question. Joyce: I know quite clearly there has been an absolute diligent oversight within the Liberal party, the leader of the Liberal party, the member for Cook, the leader of the coalition prime minister, and I’m going to the process of making sure that I respect the views of my party room, [to where the] question goes to, we have seen the results of modelling, we have seen that in a whole range of reflections on the price of commodities. We all get a lovely view of Bob Katter’s nose as he asks a question virtually. Moving on. While “WILL YOU RELEASE THE MODELLING’ might be giving you all flashbacks to the 2019 election campaign, there are other examples – like when then-treasurer in 2017, wouldn’t release the economic modelling for the proposed tax cuts. (spoiler – that was Scott Morrison) Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Has the government modelled the impact of our emissions by 2050? If the answer is yes, will the government released the modelling, if the answer is yes, when? Morrison: When the government has fully considered these matters we will be setting out all of our plans and we will be setting out all the benefits and we will be setting out all the matters that relate to those policies, and that is the answer to the question. We will be very transparent where we have been able to assess the impact of our policies, and to demonstrate, those benefits we will certainly do that and that will be the case when the members refer to. We will do that before the next election and I suspect we will do it a lot sooner before they make their mind up about the 2030 commitment, they asked me about this over one year ago, and they still can’t tell the Australian people what the 2030 commitment is. I don’t know what the time delay is on outside, but they cannot make their mind up about... Tony Burke gets up with a point of order, but Morrison has decided he has concluded his answer. The current deputy prime minister is attempting to answer a dixer question, which is like trying to watch someone describe what the number 54 smells like and makes just as much sense. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister and I refer to his previous answer in which he mentioned the importance of transparency. For the prime minister release government modelling on the impacts of net zero emissions by 2050 ascended to the Nationals’ party room. Why is this modelling secret? Peter Dutton objects: Mr Speaker, as I understood, not that I was paying great attention to the member for McMahon, as probably the most in this chamber. I heard the member for McMahon talk about the presentation to the Nationals’ party room. The premise was not in that meeting, he didn’t attend the meeting. It was at entirely appropriate matter for that National party and I don’t know how the prime minister can be expected to answer that question. Tony Smith points out that Dutton just posted his own L: The question was whether the prime minister would release the modelling that was provided. So Morrison has to answer. Morrison: I can’t speak to the National party room anymore than the leader of the Nationals can speak to the discussions of the Liberal room. We are two great proud parties and we hold a great Coalition, Mr Speaker, as we have done for many, many years and continue to do so. Mr Speaker, what I can be very clear to the Australian people about is we will be very transparent about what our commitments are, very transparent about what our commitments are ... what the costs are, Mr Speaker, what the outcome is going to be... what our commitments are. What the costs are. That is exactly what I did at the last election. At the last election I set out very clearly what our 2030 target was going to be, how we were going to achieve it, that we would meet and beat it, what the cost would be, what the programs were, Mr Speaker, and as a result, the Australian people backed our plan. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, the Labor party, they had a 45% emissions reduction target. The then-Leader of the opposition couldn’t explain issues, Mr Speaker, he couldn’t level with the Australian people. Smith: Just saying to the prime minister, it is not an opportunity to now move off the question which was a very specific one about whether he would or wouldn’t release modelling and I think the prime minister’s answered that. But it is not an opportunity to talk about the opposition policies at the last election. Morrison: Mr Speaker, I can be very clear with the Australia people. We will set these things out very clearly because that is our form, that is what we have done because Mr Speaker that is important, for Australians to know what our plans are, as they are aware of all plans of those who would go to the next election pretending to do various things. Now we will be very clear about our plans, people know what our 2030 commitment is, Mr Speaker. It is a mystery what those opposite’s 2030 commitment is, Mr Speaker. There is no plan there. There is no plan for 2050 from those opposite, Mr Speaker. We will be clear about the costs, we will explain to people in rural and regional Australia in particular how we will be standing with them as they work through the challenges that they will face and realise the opportunities that are therefore more jobs, more opportunities, more investment and a stronger rural and regional Australia, Mr Speaker. So I welcome the fact that in asking this question, Mr Speaker, the Labor party are saying that the standard is you’ve got to tell people what your plans are and what your costs are and what it means for them, Mr Speaker, and that will be the first time they have ever done that! Morrison seems a little cranky today. Stephen Jones to Scott Morrison: What is the impact on the economy of a net zero by 2050 target? Morrison: If you have the right plan it is a positive impact, Mr Speaker. If you have the right plan, Mr Speaker, if you have technology not taxes, Mr Speaker, if you don’t have a carbon tax, Mr Speaker, if you actually have a plan that respects people’s choices rather than to force their choices, Mr Speaker! If you have a balance of technologies and they can get to an affordable cost, if you can ensure that you get the balance right between affordable and reliable energy and you don’t rush the plan, Mr Speaker, and you allow those technologies to develop and you have your transition fuels in place to ensure you keep the lights on and the cost down, Mr Speaker, and if you have a credible plan, Mr Speaker, with the proper transparencies Australia’s well known for, then it can be a great positive for Australia, it can be a great positive for Australia. But if you take the approach, Mr Speaker, that those opposite took when they were in government which was to impose at carbon tax, Mr Speaker, and I know that Senator Gallagher says that a carbon price from Labor is back on the table*, it is back on the table, Mr Speaker! So really what this will be about, Mr Speaker, ultimately, in anyone’s ambitions to achieve net zero, it is all about the plan. It is all about the economic plan, Mr Speaker, and who Australians would trust with the economic plan that can take Australians through what will be challenging time. And who can really trust to look after regional Australia, Mr Speaker, and they know they can’t trust the Labor Party on these issues, Mr Speaker. At the last election they took a policy... Tony Smith: The prime minister’s now drifting from what was a very specific question. He has compared and contrasted but has now drifted off the question and I’m needing him to come back to the question. Morrison: Mr Speaker, again. With the right plan it is a positive benefit, Mr Speaker. With the right plan is a positive benefit. But what we do know, what we do know is this, Mr Speaker, and that is the global economy is changing while the world response to climate change! And those changes, Mr Speaker, will have an impact on the Australian economy. They do present risks and threats to rural and regional areas and only the Coalition can be trusted to ensure that we can deal with those threats, that we can support rural and regional Australia, Mr Speaker, and if you don’t believe me, believe the member for Hunter, Mr Speaker, and it is pretty clear that Labor has lost its way on that issue. *Katy Gallagher did not say a carbon tax was back on the table – she said she would not be ruling anything in or out, as Labor was yet to announce its policy and it was not her job to do that. It’s almost time for QT – expect it to play out pretty much like it did yesterday. Here’s a little bit more information on the contributions made in the joint partyroom meeting of Liberal and National MPs on climate change policy. Queensland senator Matt Canavan spoke about polling ahead of the last election which showed that people didn’t support the Adani coal mine. “Yet we approved it, and when Bob Brown turned up we stood by our values and we went on to win an election,” Canavan said. He compared the success of the 2019 campaign with the 2016 election under Malcolm Turnbull that focused on “jobs and growth”. “There was an approach in relation to giving everything to everyone that they like and it was too good to be true. We don’t want to hear jobs and growth 2.0.” He said for this reason, the government should proceed with investigating nuclear power, saying, “they don’t like it but we have to do what is right.” Fellow Queensland senator Gerard Rennick also spoke briefly about climate policy, criticising the “march to the Left” of the Business Council of Australia. The BCA does not represent real businesses. There has never been a lack of access to foreign capital in Australia.” He referenced the sale of water licences to overseas buyers as an example. Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman has taken the opportunity during an ABC interview to remind people the final decision on net zero by 2050 will be taken by the cabinet: The final decisions will be taken by cabinet because the decisions do not involve legislation so I am not sure what the cabinet schedule is but obviously there is an endpoint which is Glasgow in a couple of weeks ie: Scott Morrison doesn’t need the Nationals to agree. There is no legislation, so no one is crossing the floor. Getting the Nationals agreement does cut down on the chances of mutiny ahead of the election. Labor is supporting the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) the trade agreement which includes the Asean states (including Myanmar) as well as other nations like China, despite the ACTU urging the party to oppose it. But shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, said Labor wants some action from the government on Myanmar’s military dictatorship: The government’s refusal to implement any sanctions since the coup in Myanmar sends precisely the wrong message: that Australia does not care and that we are mere bystanders to democratic backsliding in our region. ... Labor has sought and received assurances that Australia’s obligations under RCEP and its enabling legislation do not: remove Australia’s capacity to govern in the interest of all Australians, including protecting local jobs through the regulation of temporary work; in any way inhibit the government’s ability to implement in full the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Services; expand waivers of labour market testing; impede government procurement of goods and services locally; force the privatisation of public services; or undermine medicare or the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Moreover, RCEP does not include any investor-state dispute settlement provisions. Meanwhile, Murph has an update on where the climate discussions are at: Barnaby Joyce has acknowledged that Scott Morrison can commit Australia to a new net zero target without the endorsement of the Nationals’ party room. With Liberals and Nationals increasingly confident the Coalition is now moving towards an agreement before the Cop26 in Glasgow, Joyce said on Tuesday: “The government decision on the government’s commitments for Australia in relation to Cop26 will be made by the government in cabinet.” The deputy prime minister told reporters Morrison had “his own mandate and he has his own capacity and that is absolutely and utterly his own right”. Coalition MPs have met in Canberra, but the issue of net zero by 2050 was not discussed. Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce did not speak on it, there was no discussion, although as Murph reported a little earlier Matt Canavan and Gerard Rennick made statements on climate. Morrison started off the meeting talking about the success of the country’s vaccination program. He said that the “extraordinary” uptake showed the importance of patience, saying he had taken the counsel of John Howard to get the policy right and focus on results.This meant avoiding getting dragged into short term tactical contests. “The issue has been transformed because of the success of our policy.” “Sometimes you have to go through a bit of political pain to get it done and to get the outcome,” Morrison said. Both Morrison and the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce also spoke about the importance of cracking down on the tech giants. The issue has gained traction after Joyce spoke about the impact of online harassment on his daughter. Joyce said “something is going to happen” and MPs would know they “did good” on helping to regulate the sector. Joyce said if the social media companies were “smart and brilliant” enough to make software that had created billions of dollars for them, they were “also smart enough to do something to deal with this issue.” In general business, one MP suggested the government needed to consider adopting nuclear power because it was the right thing to do. They warned against a repeat of the 2016 “jobs and growth” campaign, saying it had been a “rainbows and puppies” style election that tried to keep everyone happy.There was also some debate over what is known as Maeve’s Law, which will allow mitochondrial donation for families with a particular condition. Some MPs raised concern about embryo destruction. AAP has a stock market update: Shares on the Australian market were higher for a fourth consecutive day after global investors appeared optimistic about US third-quarter earnings. The domestic market was up about one quarter of a per cent and almost all categories were higher at 1200 AEDT on Tuesday. Technology and property were the clear favourites with investors. There were gains of more than three per cent for artificial intelligence software vendor Appen and financial software vendor Bravura Solutions. Wall Street traders were keen on technology stocks overnight as third-quarter earnings reports largely impress. On the ASX, the only category lower was materials as the big miners all trended lower. BHP blamed Western Australia’s tough border controls for a shortage of train drivers which contributed to producing less iron ore in its first quarter. The miner revealed production of its most lucrative commodity fell three per cent from the previous quarter, and four per cent on the 2020 first-quarter. COVID-19 border restrictions led to a shortage of train drivers. BHP shares were down 1.55 per cent to $38.58. The miner’s chief rivals fared worse. Iron ore specialist Fortescue dropped 1.76 per cent and Rio Tinto shed 2.81 per cent. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was higher by 20.5 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 7401.6. The All Ordinaries was up 25.1 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 7714.8. In case you haven’t had a chance to see it as yet, this report from Lorena Allam on the Jukkan Gorge parliamentary report is worth a few moments of your day: When Rio Tinto exploded the gorge, a 46,000-year-old site of global cultural and archaeological significance, it broke the hearts of traditional owners, appalled the nation and blew its own reputation into pieces. It also triggered a federal inquiry, which on Monday found that what happened at Juukan Gorge, while shocking, was not unique. It was one of “countless instances where cultural heritage has been the victim of the drive for development and commercial gain”, the inquiry’s final report said. There are “failures” at every level of government and there must be urgent legislative change to stop the destruction of Aboriginal heritage across the nation, the report said. Victoria is opening up GP respiratory clinics to help the health system – the RACGP is happy: The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has welcomed the Victorian Government’s announcement that it will fast track the opening of 20 GP respiratory clinics. The clinics will be opened in COVID-19 hotspots across Melbourne under a $23.8m state government initiative, providing COVID-19 testing and treatment services for more than 350 patients suffering respiratory symptoms each week. The new clinics are scheduled to be opened in three to six weeks. RACGP Victoria Chair Dr Anita Munoz welcomed the announcement. “The Department of Health sought our input in designing a system to manange respiratory presentations in the community,” she said. “The new GP respiratory clinics will help ease the burden on emergency departments, which have been under a great deal of pressure, and support patients experiencing respiratory symptoms. “The RACGP has been consulting closely with government on this initiative.” There is nothing good about this: Labor MP Julian Hill will introduce a private member’s bill to implement Labor’s policy to end the cashless debit card trials on 31 January, to be replaced by a local jobs plan for the areas where the card is now in use. The bill also contains transparency measures that would force the government to reveal the total cost and table contracts with Indue, the card’s provider. Labor has been running hard on the issue, with MP Justine Elliot claiming that the government had made changes that would allow the card to be extended to pensioner. The government rejects this, explaining that the legislation she cited only allows the Family Responsibilities Commission in Cape York to put aged pensioners on the card. Hill told Guardian Australia: Enough is enough. This bill will scrap the scheme and stop the government forcing the card onto all aged pensioners. The minister will have to come clean, release the secret contracts with Indue and confess how much taxpayer money has been wasted. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, has accused Labor of lying about the putting pensioners on the debit card: A Liberal senator just had to gag a National senator in the Senate. Given what is allowed to fly from some of their colleague’s mouths at times it’s nice to see where they draw the line. WA Greens senator Dorinda Cox, who was sworn into the Senate yesterday, was welcomed to country at a smoking ceremony at the Old Parliament House tent embassy this morning. Cox is the first female Indigenous senator from WA. She will deliver her first speech at 5pm (but has already impressed in media appearances and contributions in the Senate, on her first day). Over in the House, Greens leader Adam Bandt is attempting to disallow the Arena (Australian Renewable Energy Agency) changes the government is pushing through (which would mean Arena funds could be used to finance fossil fuel projects). Labor and the Greens lost this battle in the Senate yesterday, as Paul Karp reported, when One Nation tanked the numbers. The Greens and Labor don’t have the numbers in the House – so it would mean someone would have to cross the floor for Bandt to be successful, which won’t happen. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has told the caucus that Scott Morrison may call an election for 11 December: At heart of the Morrison government is a focus group, at the heart of Labor is its values ... It is possible that Scott Morrison comes back from Glasgow and calls a December 11 election – we are prepared for that, we are ready for it whenever it happens, this caucus is ready to govern. Albanese criticised the Coalition for its record on climate change, noting that John Howard had supported an emissions trading scheme before the 2007 election but they never enacted one: They’re making the case for action but can’t be trusted to act. In terms of the legislation dealt with, Labor has decided to support the government’s high-risk terrorist offenders bill, which allows state and territory supreme courts to make an extended supervision order as an alternative to a continuing detention order once high-risk terrorist offenders are released from prison. Labor also agreed to support the bill implementing the RCEP trade agreement. Despite the ACTU call to oppose it, just two MPs queried the wisdom of the move including Libby Coker, who asked about labour market testing and local jobs, and another who asked about First Nations intellectual property protection. The shadow trade minister, Madeline King, said RCEP would happen with or without Australia, and it would be beneficial to join an agreement that will cover one-third of global trade and elevates Asean. There were contributions in support from Peter Khalil and Andrew Leigh. One MP complained about Clive Palmer’s $1m ad spend on YouTube, including claims the ads misrepresent the TGA’s vaccination adverse events report. Mark Butler said Labor had some success lobbying for Facebook to take material down, but the AEC was taking no action and the government had done “nothing to restrain” Palmer. Half of Labor (led by the Queenslanders) are spooked there will be an election by the end of the year. 7 December is the latest date. The theory is Scott Morrison returns from Glasgow and calls an election, and then there is one before Christmas, when the health system begins to get hit by the influx of cases. No one knows what is going to happen. No one. But if you hold an election on 7 December, then the campaign can’t enter Queensland, WA, South Australia and Tasmania, or the Northern Territory. Not easily anyway. So it would be a NSW and Victorian (but possibly not Melbourne) campaign. That doesn’t make sense to me. It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, and there are plans for virtual campaigns, but you would think that the prime minister would want everyone to get together over the summer, have a relatively normal one, calm down, and then go to an election. Again – no one knows. The only thing set in stone is that an ordinary election has to be held before 22 May (21 May being the last date a half Senate and House election can be held). The Liberals and Nationals faced each other this morning for the first time since the net zero discussion has reached the sharp end. The short version of the Coalition party room today was that Gerard Rennick and Matt Canavan raised objections. In the Liberal party room that preceded the joint party room, Liberals Trent Zimmerman, Julian Leser, and Lucy Wicks expressed support. The Queensland Liberal Garth Hamilton expressed caution. I’ve been taking a look at what’s happening with Australia’s supply of AstraZeneca in recent weeks, given the significant increase in Pfizer use. The data shows quite a significant cut in the number of AZ doses set aside for donations to the Pacific last week, despite strong local production and flagging domestic demand. Reports from the vaccine operations centre show the volume of doses made available for distribution to the Pacific fell to just 26,500 last week, down from 308,000 and 200,000 in the two weeks prior, and weekly totals of 500,000 through much of September. It is the lowest number of doses set aside for the Pacific since June. The data reflects the number of doses made available to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, rather than actual deliveries made to Pacific countries. We’ve asked the government for an explanation. The second day of the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog’s investigation into former premier Gladys Berejiklian has begun with the evidence of Paul Doorn, a former executive director within the office of sport. Counsel assisting the commission Scott Robertson has spent the morning asking Doorn about the $5.5m grant given to the Australian Clay Target Association in former NSW Liberal MP Daryl Maguire’s electorate of Wagga Wagga. The grant is one of two at the centre of the Independent Commission Against Corruption’s investigation into whether Berejiklian breached the public’s trust by “exercising public functions” in circumstances where she had a conflict of interest because of her secret relationship with Maguire. This morning we heard that Maguire had twice approached the office of sport seeking funding for the gun club, once in 2012 and then again in 2016. At the time, Doorn says, the department viewed the project as a “low priority”. Particularly, he told the inquiry this morning, because Sydney already had an Olympic-standard shooting facility. It would have been a “duplication of facilities”, he said, which would have risked cannibalising attempts to bring events to the Sydney facility. Despite that, when Maguire made his second approach about the facility in 2016 – this time to then minister for sport, Stuart Ayres – Doorn was asked to prepare a submission to the government’s expenditure review committee as a matter of urgency. He understood the project had “some level of support” within the government. Doorn says based on his discussions with Ayres’ office, he remembered that there “might have been funding available from a different portfolio”, and that making an approach to the ERC could have been a faster way of securing funding for the Wagga shooting complex. We heard about this submission yesterday, when public servant Michael Toohey told the committee he had been asked by Doorn to prepare a draft in a single day, something both men have described as “unusual” and not something they had been asked to do before. But Doorn has told the inquiry he didn’t understand why the matter had become urgent, other than that the minister had appeared to have secured a timeslot to address the expenditure review committee. He described it as “procedural urgency”. Meanwhile, in the Northern Territory, the NT News reports: The Territory Response Group (TRG) was sent to patrol Chief Minister Michael Gunner’s family home on Saturday night after anti-vaccination protesters shouted his home address at a Darwin CBD rally and threatened to attack him. However, Mr Gunner says he will not back down on his government’s mandatory vaccination laws, describing the protesters as a “delusional minority”. Police have confirmed they are investigating after a video was posted on Facebook showing protesters shouting Mr Gunner’s address and threatening to “go get him”. The Coalition joint party room is also out – we will have an update on how that went very soon. Will Victoria be opening international borders, like NSW? Daniel Andrews: Victoria won’t open international borders – the commonwealth will open international borders. And the prime minister made that point very clearly the other day but I’m very keen that we have a national cabinet meeting and get everybody on the same page and that there is as best we can a consistent quarantine process, a consistent set of dates for when different groups of people, whether they are international students, business visas, returning Australians, whether they be permanent residents or Australian citizens, whatever other kind of schemes and arrangements that the commonwealth may well, like a New Zealand-type arrangement, if they got others of those that they want to put forward, all of that really does fall to the commonwealth government. There is some irony that the this whole thing has come down to who is responsible for what given that we have sort of rewritten who is respond all for what, but I don’t issue visas or passports, that is a matter for the commonwealth government. But we will have a quarantine system that is as light-touch as possible. When you get to 90-plus vaccination rates, you always have more options and was made that point hundreds and hundreds of times, that is why it is so pleasing, that is why I think we are also proud of each other that we’ve gone and got the jab in record time and in record numbers, it does give us more options. It means that we might be able to do, in fact we almost certainly will be able to do, home-based quarantine for some people, no quarantine for others, if they are double-dose vaccinated and they got a negative test. Daniel Andrews is holding Victoria’s Covid press conference, where he has been asked whether or not he is frustrated the federal government hasn’t started the third dose program as yet (technically, it’s not a booster, it’s a third dose of the vaccine): We just really appreciate some clarity as soon as we can and I’m sure the commonwealth is working towards that, because if we can just sort of seamlessly move from 55 state hubs and a whole lot of pop-ups, if we can just switch that across to a booster program rather than pull all that apart, close it all down then have to start again. That assumes that the commonwealth wants us to play that role – only they can answer that – but we are certainly happy to do that work because ultimately the consequences of that not being done well, that will be something that is very real for all of us. The Labor caucus meeting is out – we will have an update on how that meeting went, along with what the outcome of what happened in response to the ACTU calling on Labor to oppose the RCEP trade agreement. The push to get the vaccine before Australia reopening is officially on – not just in the Covid-zero states, but federally as well. Here is AAP on Greg Hunt this morning: Unvaccinated Australians have been warned they will be exposed to COVID-19 in coming months as more restrictions ease. The nation will on Tuesday pass 85 per cent single-dose coverage of people aged 16 and above with the 70 per cent two-jab milestone set to be reached later in the week. Health Minister Greg Hunt has made a fresh appeal to about three million Australians yet to roll up their sleeves. “At some stage, everybody will be exposed to the disease,” he told 2CC radio. “We have to prepare and say nobody’s immune. Everybody is ultimately at risk and you protect yourself and your family.” Mr Hunt said the 47,000 people aged between 16 and 65 who contracted the disease provided a strong case study about the power of vaccines. “Of those, only four per cent have been fully vaccinated,” he said. “Of those sadly that went on to pass away, only one per cent were fully vaccinated.” I am not sure if Bill Shorten has actually seen Squid Game. But yelling about net zero targets wasn’t one of the games. The Greens party room discussed the government’s climate negotiations. Despite the public argy bargy on net zero by 2050, the Greens believe the government has already failed the test for meaningful action by declining to set a more ambitious 2030 target. Even releasing a trajectory showing an improvement from the 26% reduction by 2030 is not good enough, because state targets alone would amount to a 36% decrease. The Greens plan to push to suspend standing orders over the issue. The Greens are also upset at Labor for supporting a bill that will allow the Export Finance Investment Corporation to invest in coal and gas projects. They will also continue to push for a national integrity commission/federal Icac, using a concurrence motion in the lower house. Remember the federal integrity commission? I know it was only last week that we were talking about that again (and the government’s inaction on it) but a week is a long time in auspol, so it has sort of dropped off again. Enter Rex Patrick, who wants to introduce a bill to the Senate tomorrow, in line with what the crossbenchers in the House want the parliament to adopt – an actual federal integrity commission. That means there is now a push from crossbenchers across both chambers. We’ll keep you updated. Angus Taylor was on Canberra radio 2CC this morning, where he was asked about net zero by 2050 and the whole kerfuffle within the Coalition at the moment. Has the government been “snookered” into following the opposition down this path was the opening question: No, I don’t think so. I mean, look, we’ll do what’s right for Australia. We’ll do what’s right for communities right across Australia, particularly our regional communities. As we look forward here, Stephen, we’ve got a situation where over time customers demands are changing. They’re already changing. The Japanese, the Koreans, our big export customers for our products, resources in agriculture. We need to evolve with that. We’re not going to force loss of jobs. We’re not going to pre-empt any move by our customers. But I tell you what we are going to do. We are going to adapt to our customers like this country has done for hundreds of years, and we’re going to do it in a sensible way, which protects our traditional industries of agriculture, mining, heavy manufacturing. And at the same time, we’re going to make sure that Australians don’t have costs imposed on them, taxes on their electricity or other energy sources. And we’ll make sure that this pathway is a sensible one forward. But what matters here is the plan, at the end of the day is the plan that counts. Labor doesn’t have a plan. We have no idea what they have in mind, but we know where they always end up, which is the carbon tax, electricity tax and imposing costs on these communities. Meanwhile, Labor MPs are enjoying the chance to troll moderate Liberals: There have been arrests outside parliament – including an 80-year-old woman. The joint party room meeting is under way. We’ve heard from a lot of voices already so we’ll let you know who was the loudest in the room. Craig Kelly has temporarily relocated to Canberra because he has not been vaccinated. He quarantined for 15 nights before the sitting in Canberra and has no plans on travelling back to NSW in between sittings. So he has plenty of time to spend on social media. It seems there are quite a few people – including the president of the Royal Australian College of GPs – who have had enough: Meanwhile, in very loud minority world: NSW CHO Dr Kerry Chant was at today’s health presser. She said the health system was under strain but holding up and she was heartened by the vaccination rates. But she said she also expects infection rates will begin to increase again, from next week: There are a lot of uncertainties about what case numbers will do. We would believe they would go up, as we have more interactions. But as I said, it is in the hands of everyone. So, the more people who continue to get tested, the more people followed a public health advice, the more people that get vaccinated, all give us protections. So we have, to some extent, all of the modelling depends on judging what testing levels are, what the vaccination levels are, what the number of interactions people have. So we have given guidance, so to some extent it is about how people behave responsibly as we open up, but the models will show. But we are expecting it does take a lag. So we would not be expecting numbers to rise within a two-week period, so next week I will be really interested in what our numbers are … I am so pleased we have 90,000 tests. We are going to need to keep those testing rates up and thank you to everyone of those individuals who have come forward. There is no universe where Matt Canavan would accept a net zero by 2050 target, even if he was given every single piece of modelling in the world. We know this. Canavan is playing the role of the strong holdout National MP, so when it comes to the election campaign, he can speak to all of those people in Nationals electorates (particularly central Queensland) and let them know he was always on their side – and therefore, they still have a voice in the Nats. It’s a little more quiet this morning – Tuesdays are always a little calmer (at least in the morning) because all the MPs get locked up in party room meetings. We’ll let you know the outcome of those as soon as they happen. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has announced changes to the ACT’s Covid roadmap, now that the territory has reached 80%. The main takeaways – face masks won’t be needed outdoors from 29 October and the NSW Covid declaration will be lifted from 1 November. Retail will reopen (with Covid plans) from this Friday. Which means there will be no need to quarantine if you go anywhere in NSW and return to the territory – including Sydney – from 1 November. Yesterday it was Pikachus – today koalas. Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Miriam Robinson has commented on the latest XR protest outside Parliament House: Environment Minister Sussan Ley has recently given approval for three new coal mines. This is not the action of a minister who understands that the climate emergency is real and that the government owes a Duty of Care for future generations, not only of people, but animals too. We demand government drop its appeal against the Federal Court ruling that it owes a ‘Duty of Care’ to protect Australia’s children from the dangers of climate related harm. We just want our government to do their job. All we ask is that they act in the interests of the people, not their donors and not the corporations. Is this too much to ask? The Liberal MP for Reid, Dr Fiona Martin, seems to be bracing for something: NSW and Victoria have posted their Covid numbers for this morning: Sending all of the love to the families and loved ones of those who have lost people during the pandemic. Barnaby Joyce now has his lines and is sticking to them, when it comes to how he speaks about the climate debate: We’ve been down this path before – ETS, the single desk, the carbon tax debates. The Nationals are well-versed in this. We’re not concentrating on that. We’re concentrating right now on one thing. That’s making sure we look after regional people – they send us to Canberra, they have their concerns, they’re conveying it to our office loud and clear, and we are making sure they have a time to be heard and a time for us to give our best endeavours to make sure their best concerns are dealt with. The Nationals are going through that process. People are aware and we want to make sure we get to a conclusion to make sure that we can go back to our electorates and say, “These were the concerns you conveyed to us. And this was the valid attempt we put towards trying to make sure that those concerns were dealt with.” Extinction Rebellion protesters have staged another protest outside parliament this morning: Another entry in the “MPs treating the register of interests as a joke” cabinet: Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Australians believe federal and state governments have not collaborated well during the pandemic, according to a new poll. That is the result of an Ipsos FastFacts poll of 1,000 Australians designed and commissioned by the McKinnon prize in political leadership. The result of the poll was released on Tuesday to mark the opening of nominations for the award, which was established in 2017, when Liberal senator Dean Smith was its inaugural winner. Previous winners include Labor Senate leader Penny Wong (2018); former NSW premier Gladys Berejkilian (2019), who is now being investigated by Icac; and health minister, Greg Hunt (2020). The award also has an emerging leaders category, which was won last year by Labor MP Anne Aly. 2021 McKinnon prize ambassador Amanda Vanstone said: The formation of the national cabinet signalled the desire for collaboration across federal and state governments to manage the pandemic together and support all Australians. However, as the pandemic affected different states in different ways, and citizens and commentators began to apportion the blame on different leaders, our federation splintered along state and party lines, which presents a real challenge for elected leaders. Another prize ambassador, Simon Crean, said: We know that Australians are generally supportive of national cabinet, but they don’t see it working … With Australia facing immense challenges at home, in our region and the wider world, it’s more important than ever that we have courageous and visionary leaders. We need leaders who are able to respond to crises with urgency and articulate a vision to lead the nation through its recovery over the next decade. Queensland has announced its roadmap to reopening its borders to hotspot states in time for Christmas – making it the first Covid-free state to do so. That has left some Queenslanders “scared” because of the lower than the national average vaccination rates and the inevitability of an outbreak, once border lockdowns are a thing of the past. The state is pushing a massive vaccination program now, telling people who haven’t got the vaccine, it is now time – the state is opening. That’s particularly relevant for regional areas, which are behind Brisbane and the more urban areas of the south-east. Annastacia Palaszczuk spoke to ABC News Breakfast this morning and said there was no need to panic: They shouldn’t be scared. Let me tell you – look, my job has been – and I’ve said fundamentally – to keep them safe. We have weathered this pandemic. Queenslanders, they step up and they do everything that they are asked to do. We’ve done natural disasters, we’ve been through cyclones, we’ve been through floods – you name it up here, we’ve all worked together. Now, this is like weathering the next cyclone. So what I’m saying to Queenslanders is – now is the time to get ready and be prepared. Now is the time to make sure you get vaccinated. And we will weather this storm together. Absolutely we’re in this together. Keith Pitt is not in a happy place, at least judging from this interview. He’s a no to net zero (at this stage) and has been for some time. He doesn’t sit in cabinet. (When Barnaby Joyce came back as leader, Pitt kept his portfolios but was booted from cabinet and moved to the ministry – so the Coalition government moved resources out of the cabinet. You could imagine what would have happened if a Labor government did that.) But, as a minister, he does still have to fall into line with what the government wants. So even though the Liberals led by the prime minister are behind net zero by 2050, with Scott Morrison intending on taking that to Glasgow, Pitt is pretending there is not a decision. But when there is a decision, he will accept the government’s decision. Even though right now, he is pretending there is a choice: I’m a member of the executive. My position will always be the government’s position but right now that is not established. Resources minister Keith Pitt (who wanted $250bn for the fossil fuel industry transition in exchange for support for net zero by 2050) was on ABC radio RN this morning, where he was asked if he believed in climate change: The climate’s changing, it’s always changed. Do I think Australia can change the temperature of the globe? If we shut our economy, I don’t think it will make one iota of a difference. The thing is, no one, even in this conversation, is talking about shutting Australia’s economy. In fact, the Liberals have bent over backwards to talk about how coal is still a huge part of the economy, Well this is a little interesting; a couple of secret squirrels have just let us know the ACTU has written to the entire Labor caucus asking the party to oppose the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement. If you haven’t heard of it, don’t worry – it doesn’t exactly have a catchy name, and includes a mismatch of about 15 countries from across the 10 Asean states, as well as China, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. Myanmar is one of the Asean states involved. The legislation is in front of the parliament today – the government hopes to have the agreement, which will be the world’s largest trade agreement – ratified by the end of the year. But the ACTU is urging Labor to vote against it. This letter has gone to all members of the Labor caucus sometime this morning: Dear Senator or Member, As you know, this week the Parliament will be asked to pass enabling legislation to ratify the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Australian Unions are urgently calling on Parliament to oppose ratification of RCEP in its current form. Attached is a note outlining just some of the union movement’s concerns about RCEP. Support for RCEP will legitimise Myanmar’s brutal military dictatorship on the world stage. It will put local jobs at risk and encourage the further abuse and exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers. Ratification of RCEP may also prevent the Australian Government from effectively regulating Aged Care, including by implementing the important recommendations of the Aged Care Royal Commission. We urge you to oppose the RCEP enabling legislation when it comes before the Parliament. Yours sincerely, Michele (That would be Michele O’Neil, the president of the ACTU.) Labor’s caucus is also meeting today (Tuesday is the party room meeting), when legislation will be considered. Trade agreements are always a fraught issue for the Labor party – this is going to make caucus a little more interesting this morning. There has been a little bit of nuclear talk as part of this latest debate – but not too much. Why? Well, Australia has a moratorium on nuclear for one thing. And no one wants the waste in their backyard for another. It’s also not particularly cost-effective. It’s not a renewable (uranium is finite) and it’s not green. And that’s before you even consider how long it would take to start the industry from scratch. And also worth keeping in mind – the Liberals don’t actually need the Nationals to move ahead with the climate commitments. Nothing is going to parliament (at least at this stage – because we are talking a 2050 plan) which means there’s no danger of people crossing the floor. Scott Morrison told the Liberal party room yesterday he planned on taking Australia’s commitment to net zero by 2050 to Glasgow as an NDC – a nationally determined contribution – which doesn’t need the parliament either. It’s essentially a pledge which says “we intend to do this”, and makes it a little more official, rather than just a speech. He doesn’t need the Nationals for that either. Don’t expect there to be any resolution on climate today – this is going to drag on for at least the week. Scott Morrison doesn’t head to Glasgow until the end of next week, so there is a bit of time. We don’t know what the sweeteners the Nationals will be offered to smooth the transition (will it Barnaby Joyce’s vanity projects, like the inland rail to a coal port? Money for fossil fuels? Or regional health and infrastructure before the election?) That should all be revealed soon. Ready for more climate talk? Because you’ll be hearing a lot of it today. Again. Despite being one of the governing parties for the past eight years, and being heavily involved in the climate policy wars, the Nationals, led by Barnaby Joyce, have apparently never before considered a net zero by 2050 target. All we heard yesterday was how they needed to take their time to consider it, because it would be “reckless” to make a decision after a four-hour meeting. Four hours and eight years, but who’s counting? The Liberals and the Nationals are coming together for the first time in six months this morning, in a joint party room meeting, where they will hear more rah-rah speeches about how great the yet-to-be-publicly announced technology roadmap and climate plan is. In case you missed it yesterday, Scott Morrison told the Liberal party room that it would be cabinet that made the decision about net zero by 2050. Which means that if the Nationals MPs who sit in cabinet aren’t happy with the decision, they should technically resign and head back to what Joyce calls the “corridor of the nearly dead” – the backbench. When that was raised yesterday, it was dismissed as a hypothetical. But it’s not. You can have splits in the party but not in cabinet – cabinet solidarity is taken pretty seriously. So if the Nationals decide to stay in cabinet, then they have to accept the climate policy and help sell it. Which could make things a little interesting, given some of the rhetoric. And meanwhile, regional Liberal MPs, including Senator Hollie Hughes, are taking the opportunity to remind the Nationals that the Liberals actually represent more of the regions than their junior Coalition partner – 24 rural and regional Liberal MPs to 21 Nationals – so everything seems to be going fine. Just remember though, they we are only talking about 2050. The discussion of anything happening in this decade – the interim 2030 target – is off the table. And that is where the international community is at. So while the rest of the world is talking 2030, we are stuck in 2050 – when none of these people will be in parliament. Good times.

On a big screen in the Royal Academy, dreamy aerial drone footage pans across the endless white expanse of the Bolivian salt flats, while a tank of eerie green battery juice bubbles in the corner of the room. The narrator is recounting the poetic myth of how the Salar de Uyuni salt plain came to be. According to Aymara legend, the great white desert was formed by the breast milk and tears that flowed from Tunupa, a goddess in volcano form, who wept when her baby volcano was taken away from her. The mountain might have another reason to weep now. The world’s tech companies have set their sights on extracting one of the planet’s largest lithium reserves from beneath the salty crust of the Salar. “Resources begin their life in sacred landscapes,” the narrator continues. It is “the lifeblood of our technological dreams … to power the global green energy revolution”. This strange mix of poetry, science and narrative speculation sets the tone for an exhibition that is thought-provoking and frustrating in turns. Eco-Visionaries brings together artists, architects and designers whose work is inspired by our current environmental crisis. Rather than offering critical analysis or practical measures, it mostly occupies the realm of fictional scenarios and dreamy futures, veering towards climate emergency as immersive entertainment. There are some powerful moments, but overall the mood feels less visionary than plaintive, as if the problems are so far beyond our control that all we can do is make elegiac installations about them. “We wanted to make the topic accessible to as broad an audience as possible,” says curator Gonzalo Herrero Delicado. The exhibition began life at the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) in Lisbon last year, and extra works have been added in an attempt to please the wider RA audience, including pieces by fashion hype-priest Virgil Abloh and enviro-art darling Olafur Eliasson. Abloh’s contribution is one of his new designs for Ikea, a wooden farmhouse-style chair with one leg propped up by a doorstop – only here it is cast in bronze. It is apparently a comment on rising sea levels and the precariousness of our makeshift solutions, but it reads more like a gilded monument to the Swedish furniture giant’s PR stunt (the launch of Abloh’s furniture collection saw people camping outside stores overnight). Eliasson, meanwhile, has brought his familiar photographs of melting ice, which feels like an invitation to head to Tate Modern to see the rest. One of the most striking contributions comes from designer-turned-artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, who has resurrected an (extinct) male northern white rhinoceros with the help of DeepMind artificial intelligence. You hear its alarming stomping and snorting before you get to the gallery where the projection is housed, to find a pixelated apparition of the beast trapped in a white room, which gradually forms into a lifelike representation of the rhino with a (sort of) life of its own. It paces back and forth, trying to understand its environment, occasionally turning to look you in the eye. “I’m curious about the human obsession with creating new life forms while neglecting old ones,” Ginsberg says, in the show’s catalogue. “I also wanted to challenge the techno-utopian idea that we can bring extinct animals back to life. We killed all the northern white rhinos, why would we look after a new one?” If we continue down our destructive path, the work seems to say, one day simulations like Ginsberg’s might be all we have left. Elsewhere, architects indulge in blue-sky thinking (or black-sky, depending on appetite for dystopias). François Roche’s speculative project from 2002 gets another airing, imagining a building in Bangkok that could collect dust particles and carbon monoxide from the air through electrostatics, enveloping the facade with fuzzy grey fur. There are a couple of retro-futuristic floating habitats in the apocalyptic Seasteading vein, a steampunk biogas generator, as well as a proposal for a giant moving habitable structure that would fertilise the ground of the Sahara desert. Much of it feels dated, and leaves you with the impression that architects aren’t really cut out for the challenge of what lies ahead. Which is a shame, because there is a good deal of intelligent, environmentally conscious work happening in both the architecture and design worlds, beyond the purview of this exhibition. Saving the best until last, the final room is the most alarming of them all. Groups of visitors are divided into two separate little auditoria and instructed to put on headphones, where they are told a lengthy tale about the unstoppable rise of jellyfish – in front of a giant swirling tank of the pulsating creatures. “We are in this crazy, unforeseen and incomprehensible situation where we are competing against jellyfish,” says one of the marine biologists narrating the story. “And they are winning.” Rising water temperatures have been a boon for the tentacled invertebrates, which are increasingly taking over the oceans. Another voice says that half a billion jellyfish per day drift into the sea of Japan. “Warm water is a disaster for anything that breathes,” says another, “and a dream come true for anything that doesn’t breathe much, like jellyfish.” Rimini Protokoll, the artist collective behind the work, says that pretty much everything that damages our ecosystem seems to benefit jellyfish: overfishing brings down the number of predatory fish that could reduce their number; plastic bags in the oceans kill other predators like turtles; warm water extends their breeding season. Last year a massive jellyfish invasion threatened to wipe out the fish population of the South Australian seaport Whyalla, while another influx paralysed the nuclear power plant in Swedish Oskarshamn when jellyfish plugged up the cooling water supply. The unnerving conclusion is that humans are not long for this Earth, while jellyfish are set to inherit the planet. It’s a bittersweet ending. While we mine, harvest and burn the planet’s resources, intoxicating everything around us, at least we’re creating a nice place for our new gelatinous overlords to reign supreme.

For here is the end of our particular world, the most northerly town – and, with Dunnet Head, the most northerly point – in mainland Britain. The ferocious seas and wide skies conjure up that falling-off-the-edge-of-the-map feeling, which always seems to accompany places that really are at the edge of the map (though which is probably psychosomatic). Here, the wild mountains and crofting villages a little to the west of Britain’s northern coast give on to gentler rolling hills of bog, gorse, heather and Neolithic cairns, which end abruptly in sheer cliffs inhabited by gazillions of seabirds. Humans are outnumbered here and, faced with that and the falling-off-the-edge-of-the-map feeling, one can’t help but get a little existential, staring out at the waves and the Orkney Islands and contemplating Brexit, Trump, the climate crisis and the state of the universe.

Here’s where things stand as we close this blog. Live coverage will resume later; all the Guardian’s Ukraine coverage can be found here. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company, Energoatom, has restored its connection between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the surveillance systems of the nuclear plant in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. The connections have previously been down as a result of Russian occupation. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has received the title of Honorary Citizen of Odesa, the Kyiv Independent reports. On Friday, Odesa mayor Henadiy Trukhanov signed an order that awarded Johnson with the Hryhoryia Marazly Honorary Badges of I, II, III degree, which automatically grants him the title. Ukraine’s rebuilding plans will need to address restoring war-torn ecosystems, the EU Commissioner for the Environment said. Virginijus Sinkevicius warned the environmental cost of the conflict was “increasing every day” - and said it could take “generations” to overcome. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Latin American leaders on Friday in attempts to obtain support from Latin America in his country’s fight against the Russian invasion. “I continue to establish relations with an important region — Latin America,” Zelenskiy wrote on social media in regards to his conversations with leaders of Argentina and Chile. Ukraine’s army accused Russia of carrying out strikes using incendiary phosphorus munitions on Snake Island Friday, just a day after Moscow withdrew its forces from the strategic Black Sea outpost. “Today at around 18:00... Russian air force SU-30 planes twice conducted strikes with phosphorus bombs on Zmiinyi island,” it said in a statement, using another name for Snake Island. A new Reuters investigation has found that at least 14 Russian weapons companies have not faced any Western sanctions. “Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom,” the Reuters report said. The US announced on Friday that it will provide Ukraine with an additional $820 million in military aid. The new aid package will include new surface-to-air missile systems and counter-artillery radars to respond to Russia’s long-range strikes in its war against Ukraine. Ukraine’s outspoken ambassador to Germany, a talkshow staple who was central to the public debates that led Berlin to step up weapons deliveries to Kyiv, is facing criticism for defending World War Two Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera in an interview. An interview with journalist blogger Tilo Jung published on Thursday quoted the ambassador saying that Bandera was not a “mass murderer of Poles and Jews,” causing uproar from both the Polish government and the Israeli embassy. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company, Energoatom, has restored its connection between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the nuclear plant in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, the Kyiv Independent reports. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has received the title of Honorary Citizen of Odesa, the Kyiv Independent reports. On Friday, Odesa mayor Henadiy Trukhanov signed an order that awarded Johnson with the Hryhoryia Marazly Honorary Badges of I, II, III degree, which automatically grants him the title. According to Trukhanov, if the rest of the world took the same position against Russia as the people of Britain did since the invasion began in February, then Ukraine would have long defeated Russia. Ukraine’s rebuilding plans will need to address restoring war-torn ecosystems, the EU Commissioner for the Environment said. Virginijus Sinkevicius warned the environmental cost of the conflict was “increasing every day” - and said it could take “generations” to overcome. Next week, various countries’ leaders and international organisations will meet in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss rebuilding Ukraine, hoping to draw up a “Marshall Plan” for the country’s reconstruction even as war with Russia rages. The plan will “absolutely” have to include an environmental component, Sinkevicius told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday, noting the mass destruction of forests, land covered with mines and trenches, chemical pollution spread by munitions, and contamnated waterways and soil. “The (environmental) price tag every day is increasing, because we see the barbaric actions of the Russian side (are) not stopping,” Sinkevicius said. “They bomb chemicals facilities” and have put nuclear power plants at risk, he said, adding that “hundreds of thousands of tonnes” of destroyed Russian military machinery would need to be cleared. He said the environmental damage as a result of the war was “a crime of the biggest scale” that would “take generations to deal with.” He added there was now a “unique opportunity” to create a “cleaner” Ukraine, but warned: “We can rebuild roads, we can rebuild the infrastructure, but for forests to grow, you need hundreds of years. So it will take time.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Latin American leaders on Friday in attempts to obtain support from Latin America in his country’s fight against the Russian invasion. “I continue to establish relations with an important region — Latin America,” Zelenskiy wrote on social media in regards to his conversations with leaders of Argentina and Chile. The conversations with Argentina’s Alberto Fernández and Chile’s Gabriel Boric came a comes after Zelenskiy spoke with Ecuadorian president Guillermo Lasso and Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei a little over two weeks ago. At the time, Zelenskiy said in a speech that the conversations with Lasso and Giammattei marked “the beginning of our new policy of restoring relations with Latin America.” Fernández held a 35-minute call with Ukraine’s leader, in which he offered help in any negotiations that may take place with Russia, according to a press release by the Argentinian government. As the current head of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Fernández told Zelenskiy, “Latin America is a continent of peace that rejects the use of force and promotes dialogue to resolve conflicts,” according to the release. Before the war, Fernández was moving to improve relations with Russia. In a sit-down with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow in early February, Fernández said Argentina should become the “entry door to Latin America” for Russia. Fernández later condemned Russia’s invasion. Boric later wrote that during his conversation with Zelenskiy, he “expressed my solidarity and our willingness to support the condemnations of the invasion in international organizations,” adding that Ukraine “has a friend in South America.” Zelenskiy wrote that he thanked Boric for his country’s support in the United Nations and “discussed the possibility of involving Chilean specialists in demining.” Ukraine’s army accused Russia of carrying out strikes using incendiary phosphorus munitions on Snake Island Friday, just a day after Moscow withdrew its forces from the strategic Black Sea outpost. “Today at around 18:00... Russian air force SU-30 planes twice conducted strikes with phosphorus bombs on Zmiinyi island,” it said in a statement, using another name for Snake Island. The Russian defence ministry on Thursday described the retreat as “a gesture of goodwill” meant to signal that Russia will not get in the way of UN efforts to organize protected grain exports from Ukraine. The Ukrainian army on Friday accused the Russians of being unable to “respect even their own declarations”. Its statement was accompanied by a video that showed a plane drop munitions at least twice on the island, and what appeared to be white streaks rising above it. Phosphorus weapons, which leave a signature white trail in the sky, are incendiary weapons whose use against civilians is banned under an international convention but allowed for military targets. Ukraine has accused Russia of using them several times since it invaded its neighbour in late February, including on civilian areas, allegations Moscow has denied. A new Reuters investigation has found that at least 14 Russian weapons companies have not faced any Western sanctions. Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom,” the Reuters report said. One of the weapons moguls who has not been sanctioned is Alan Lushnikov, the largest shareholder of Kalashnikov Concern JSC, the original manufacturer of the famous AK-47 assault rifle. According to records reviewed by Reuters, Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the firm. The company, which was sanctioned by the US in 2014 - the year that Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, accounts for 95% of Russia’s production of machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and other handheld firearms. The US announced on Friday that it will provide Ukraine with an additional $820 million in military aid. The new aid package will include new surface-to-air missile systems and counter-artillery radars to respond to Russia’s long-range strikes in its war against Ukraine. The Pentagon also announced that it will provide up to 150,000 rounds of millimeter artillery ammunition to Ukrainians. Friday’s announcement marks the 14th military package sent from the Defense Department’s stocks to Ukraine since August 2021. In total, the US has provided over $8.8 billion in weapons and military training to Ukraine. As part of the new package, the U.S. will purchase two systems known as NASAMS, a Norwegian-developed anti-aircraft system that is also used to protect the airspace around the White House and Capitol in Washington. The Pentagon will also provide additional ammunition for medium-range rocket systems it provided Ukraine in June, known as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS. Ukraine’s outspoken ambassador to Germany, a talkshow staple who was central to the public debates that led Berlin to step up weapons deliveries to Kyiv, is facing criticism for defending World War Two Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera in an interview. Reuters reports: Andriy Melnyk is easily the best known ambassador in Berlin, known for robust social media exchanges in which he condemned as appeasers politicians and intellectuals who opposed arming Ukraine for its fight against Russian invaders. But an interview with journalist blogger Tilo Jung published on Thursday in which he said Bandera was not a “mass murderer of Poles and Jews” caused uproar and drew condemnation from both the Polish government and the Israeli embassy. “The statement made by the Ukrainian ambassador is a distortion of the historical facts, belittles the Holocaust and is an insult to those who are murdered by Bandera and his people,” the embassy wrote on Twitter. Though he spent much of World War Two in a Nazi prison, Bandera headed the radical wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists which killed tens of thousands of Polish civilians during the war. Living in Munich in exile after the war, he was a figurehead of Ukraine’s anti-Soviet insurgency which fought Moscow in partisan actions into the 1950s. He was assassinated by the Soviet KGB in 1959. Even Ukraine’s foreign ministry distanced itself from Melnyk’s remarks, saying they did not reflect its views. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau thanked his Ukrainian counterpart for his intervention over the “false statements.” Melnyk, 46, has become a central figure in debates over Germany’s obligations to Ukraine, credited with using his pulpit as envoy of a nation fighting foreign invasion to keep up the pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who despite initial reluctance has kept boosting arms deliveries to Ukraine. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: At least 21 people, including two children, have been killed after Russian missile strikes in Odesa in southern Ukraine, Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, said. A 12-year-old boy was among the dead, he added. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries after two Russian missiles struck a multistorey block of flats and a recreation centre. The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the strike. Eight people have been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials. Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych had previously said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Two British citizens captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have been charged with “mercenary activities”, Russian state media reported. Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill have been charged by officials in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), a source in DPR law enforcement was cited as saying. Both men were refusing to cooperate with the investigation, according to Russian state-owned news agency Tass. A Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reported. The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine will begin using the death penalty in 2025, according to an updated criminal code of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). A Russian proxy court in the DPR sentenced two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun to death on charges of “terrorism”. It is unclear what the new rules would mean for the men. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become an EU member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way.” After her speech, broadcast via video link, Ukrainian lawmakers watched as the EU’s flag was hoisted in the plenary hall of the parliament in Kyiv. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said a new chapter had started for his country and the EU after Brussels formally accepted Ukraine’s candidacy to join the bloc. In a Telegram post, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s path to EU membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said war in Europe beyond Ukraine is “of course” a possibility and urged countries to support Kyiv. Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbour Russia becomes a security threat, Haavisto said in an interview with CNN, adding that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has changed the security atmosphere”. Ukrainian forces said on Thursday that they have pushed Russian forces away from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was no street fighting. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum. The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine who said newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July to either sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed that pressure from the west has pushed Russia to accelerate its integration with neighbouring Belarus. Putin’s remarks at a Russia-Belarus forum on Friday follow comments last week by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia and Belarus must take urgent joint measures to improve their defence capabilities and troops’ combat readiness. Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff. Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow. The EU said Russia’s threat to sever diplomatic ties with Bulgaria was unjustified. Ukraine has requested that Turkey detain and arrest a Russian-flagged cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said the ship, Zhibek Zholy, was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” from the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk and headed to Karasu, Turket. On Thursday, a pro-Russia official said the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”. The cooking of borsch, a beetroot and cabbage soup, in Ukraine has been added to the United Nations cultural agency’s list of endangered heritage because of Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian culture of cooking borsch, considered a national dish, has been included on Unesco’s “list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding”. Two British citizens captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have been charged with “mercenary activities”, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill have been charged by officials in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Tass cited a source in DPR law enforcement as saying. Both men were refusing to cooperate with the investigation, Tass reports. Healy, 22, was reportedly captured by Russian forces in April along with another British man, Paul Urey, at a checkpoint south of the city of Zaporizhzhia in south-eastern Ukraine. There was no mention of Urey in the report by Tass. Presidium Network, a UK-based company that says it carries out evacuations of families and individuals from war zones, said it had been intending to work with Healy and Urey. Both men appeared to be members of the public with little or no experience of military or humanitarian work. Hill, 35, a father of four from Plymouth, was reportedly captured by Russian forces during fighting in the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has condemned Russia for the missile strikes on the Odesa region that killed 21 people dead and injured dozens. Kuleba called for modern missile defence systems to be sent to Ukraine, urging allies to “help us save lives and put an end to this war”. Talina Zharikova first met people who had fled fighting in Donbas in a bomb shelter near her flat in the south-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro when the invasion started. For a while, she and her neighbours hosted them in their flats. But there were quickly more people than they could house, so Zharikova decided to ask about renovating an abandoned Soviet hospital opposite their block of flats. Zharikova, her neighbours, other Dnipro residents and those who had fled fighting set about renovating the building, which had been empty for a decade. There are now 240 people living in the various rooms in the shelter, known as Good on Love, and they say there is room for another 100. The shelter is one of more than 60 set up by Dnipro residents for evacuees. As the first city of relative safety outside many frontline areas, Dnipro has become Ukraine’s aid hub. Thousands who live there, many left jobless by the war, have thrown themselves into volunteering. Like other volunteers in Dnipro, Zharikova said the financial burden has been immense. “The city authorities didn’t help, so I fed them all with my own money for the first month. My husband is fighting at the front and I went out and got out what money I had,” said Zharikova, a former hotel manager.

The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports. The cooking of borsch, a beetroot and cabbage soup, in Ukraine has been added to the United Nations cultural agency’s list of endangered heritage because of Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian culture of cooking borsch, considered a national dish, has been included on Unesco’s “list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding”. Borsch is also widely consumed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland. The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “negative impact on this tradition” caused by the war, Unesco said. “People are unable not only to cook or grow local vegetables for borsch, but also to come together” to eat it, “which undermines the social and cultural well-being of communities”, it said. Ukraine’s minister of culture, Tkachenko Oleksandr, celebrated the decision on Twitter, tweeting: “Victory in the war for borsch is ours!” Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, also welcomed Unesco’s decision, saying: “Ukrainian Borsht derussified!” Russia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, ridiculed the move, claiming “as I understand, everything is subject to Ukrainisation”. Ukraine has requested that Turkey detain and arrest a Russian-flagged cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain, Reuters reports. The ship, Zhibek Zholy, was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” from the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk and headed to Karasu, Turkey, with 7,000 tonnes of cargo, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a letter to Turkey’s justice ministry. Separately, a Ukrainian foreign ministry official said the ship had loaded the first cargo of some 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdiansk, which the official said belonged to Ukraine. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain from occupied areas. The Kremlin has denied that Russia has stolen any Ukrainian grain. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said war in Europe beyond Ukraine is “of course” a possibility and urged countries to support Kyiv. In an interview with CNN, Haavisto was asked if Ukraine can win the war against Russia. He replied: They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are, of course, morally on the high ground. They are very united. On Tuesday, Finland, Sweden and Turkey signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later said Finland and Sweden must keep the promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament. Earlier today, Haavisto told a news conference that Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during the negotiations at the Nato summit in Madrid earlier this week. Referring to a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Haavisto told reporters: We agreed that now we have a signed text and everything that we have signed is in the text. We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals or any listings [with Turkey]. Haavisto told CNN that Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbour Russia becomes a security threat. Haavisto said: I think it’s a new reality. I really think that the European security architects [have] been broken. It’s a new situation. There’s a new kind of iron wall between Russia and the other countries. And of course, it’s based on Russia’s aggression against its neighbour Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has changed the security atmosphere”, he added. The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities. Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed. A 12-year-old boy was among the dead, he added. Ukraine’s security service had earlier put the death toll at 19. Two children were among the dead and six others among dozens injured, officials said. Authorities also said that 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 people lived. The “very heavy and very powerful” missiles were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, Bratchuk said. He said: The worst-case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odesa region. The Kremlin has denied targeting civilians. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier today. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: At least 19 people, including two children, have been killed after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa, Ukraine’s security service said. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the strike. Eight people have been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials. Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych had previously said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become an EU member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way.” After her speech, broadcast via video link, Ukrainian lawmakers watched as the EU’s flag was hoisted in the plenary hall of the parliament in Kyiv. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said a new chapter had started for his country and the EU after Brussels formally accepted Ukraine’s candidacy to join the bloc. Zelenskiy said it was a “big honour and big responsibility” to work towards realising the “aspirations of our country” in an address to Ukraine’s parliament on Friday. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s path to EU membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s president said: “We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.” Ukrainian forces said on Thursday that they have pushed Russian forces away from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was no street fighting. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports have fallen 43% year-on-year to 1.41m tonnes in June. Grain exports have slumped since the start of the war as its Black Sea ports – the key route for shipments – have been largely closed off. The government has previously said Ukraine could harvest up to 65m tonnes of grain and oilseeds this year, compared with 106m in 2021. Schools in Kyiv will reopen for classes at the start of the school year on 1 September, city authorities said. Territories adjacent to the schools will be checked for explosives and bomb shelters in schools will be restocked with water, medicine and other necessities, the head of Kyiv’s education and science department said. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum. The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine who said newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July to either sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine will begin using the death penalty in 2025, according to an updated criminal code of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). A Russian proxy court in the DPR sentenced two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun to death on charges of “terrorism”. It is unclear what the new rules would mean for the men. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed that pressure from the west has pushed Russia to accelerate its integration with neighbouring Belarus. Putin’s remarks at a Russia-Belarus forum on Friday follow comments last week by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia and Belarus must take urgent joint measures to improve their defence capabilities and troops’ combat readiness. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.” Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff. Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow. The EU said Russia’s threat to sever diplomatic ties with Bulgaria was unjustified. Finnish foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during negotiations at the Nato summit. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Thursday that Finland and Sweden must keep promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament. A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, but an edited Telegram post by the official did not say what cargo the ship was carrying. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he has been forced to take part in “educational activities” including being made to sit for hours under a portrait of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Navalny was transferred last month to a strict-regime penal colony near the town of Vladimir east of Moscow, described by his allies as “one of Russia’s scariest prisons”. In a post on Facebook, he described his life in the new prison where he said he had to sew for seven hours, five days a week. Navalny said: After work, you continue to sit. For several hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called ‘educational activities’. Even on Sundays, his official day off, he said he was made to sit on a wooden bench in a room for 10 years. He added: I don’t know who such activities can ‘educate’, except for a crooked invalid with a bad back. But maybe that’s the purpose. Navalny has described his new jail as a “prison within a prison” and said he was serving time with convicted murderers. In a Twitter thread, he compared his prison life to Putin and Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvdev, and said there was a loudspeaker in his barrack that plays songs like “Glory to the FSB”. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports have fallen 43% year-on-year to 1.41m tonnes in June, having slumped since the start of the war as its Black Sea ports – the key route for shipments – have been largely closed off. Reuters reports the ministry said farmers in southern and eastern Ukraine had already started the 2022 harvest, threshing 293,800 tonnes of grain from around 1% of the sown area. The government has previously said Ukraine could harvest up to 65m tonnes of grain and oilseeds this year, compared with 106m in 2021, due to the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. The process of Sweden and Finland joining Nato appears to have some difficulty ahead of it yet. The invitation must be ratified in parliament by all 30 allies, and there still seems to be some conflict between the Nordic countries and Turkey over what was agreed earlier in the week in Madrid. Turkey had threatened to veto their membership bids. Reuters reports that this morning Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during negotiations at the Nato summit. “We agreed that now we have a signed a text and everything that we have signed is in the text,” Haavisto told a news conference in Helsinki. “We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals.” Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said yesterday that Finland and Sweden must keep promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament. After four hours of talks in Madrid on Tuesday, Turkey, Finland and Sweden signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships, imposed by Ankara in May due to its concerns about terrorism. The signed memorandum did not list any individuals for extradition. Schools in Kyiv will reopen for classes for the start of the school year on 1 September, the city’s authorities said. Schools in the Ukrainian capital are now on summer holiday after going online when Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. The head of Kyiv’s education and science department, Olena Fidanyan, was cited by AFP as saying that the most important task for the new school year “is the safety of students and teachers”. Territories adjacent to the schools will be checked for explosives and bomb shelters in schools will be restocked with water, medicine and other necessities, she said. All schools will hold “the necessary training with teachers and children on actions during an air-raid alert”, she added. Those children who have not been able to return to Kyiv will be able to study remotely, Fidanyan said. Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff. Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow. Earlier this week, Bulgaria’s prime minister, Kiril Petkov, said his country would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff on espionage concerns. The move was the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats by Sofia in recent years and more than halved the size of Moscow’s diplomatic footprint in Bulgaria. Mitrofanova called the expulsions an “unprecedented hostile” step and on Thursday told Sofia to reverse its decision by midday on Friday. In a statement released by the embassy today, Mitrofanova said: Unfortunately, our appeal to the Bulgarian foreign ministry has been ignored. She added: I intend to quickly put the question of the closure of Russia’s embassy in Bulgaria before my country’s leadership, which will inevitably mean the closure of the Bulgarian diplomatic mission in Moscow. Responsibility for the “grave consequences of this step” will rest with Petkov’s government, Mitrofanova said. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum. The move puts many of them in a difficult position. If they do not sign, they will lose their jobs and be at risk of retaliation from Russian forces. If they sign, there is the risk of charges from Ukrainian authorities, which view teaching the Russian curriculum as a form of collaboration with the enemy. The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine whose identities, for safety reasons, cannot be revealed. They said that around mid-June newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July either to sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign, with many of them being threatened with eviction from their homes. The Russian education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, announced in June that when the new school year began in September all schools in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were to work according to Russian standards. “We will do our best to open schools on 1 September so that they are as ready as possible to function according to Russian standards,” Kravtsov said. “Integration will take place. We are already taking some steps in this direction: teacher training and the supply of textbooks.” One teacher living in a village in the occupied area of Kharkiv said: “At the moment, only history, geography, language and primary schoolteachers were asked to sign the document.” “Math, physics, biology and chemistry curriculum in Russia don’t carry propaganda, so they are left alone, at least for now,” he added. Read the full article by Lorenzo Tondo: Moscow forcing teachers in Ukraine to sign up to Russian curriculum Eight people have now been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials. Ukraine’s state emergency service reported late last night that the body of a man was discovered under a collapsed staircase, bringing the total death toll to eight and six wounded. On Wednesday, mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a new chapter had started for his country and the EU after Brussels formally accepted Ukraine’s candidacy to join the bloc. Zelenskiy said it was a “big honour and big responsibility” to work towards realising the “aspirations of our country” in a speech to Ukraine’s parliament, adding: Now we’re not close. Now we are together. He added: We made a journey of 115 days to candidate status and our journey to membership shouldn’t take decades. We should make it down this road quickly. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed pressure from the west has pushed Russia to accelerate its integration with neighbouring Belarus. “Russia and Belarus continue to grow in their cooperation in the political, trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian spheres,” Putin said in a video message at a Russia-Belarus forum. He continued: The unprecedented political and social pressure from the so-called collective west is pushing us to speed up the unification process. Together it is easier to minimise the damage from the illegal sanctions, it is easier to set up the production of demanded products, develop new competencies and expand cooperation with friendly countries. Last week, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Russia and Belarus must take urgent joint measures to improve their defence capabilities and troops’ combat readiness. At least 19 people, including two children, have been confirmed dead after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries, Ukraine’s security service said. Nearly all of the victims were in a nine-storey building hit by one missile in the village of Serhiyivka at 1am local time on Friday. At least two people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a separate strike on a holiday resort in the village. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. Speaking at the scene, Yenin said rescue operations were ongoing but “we don’t expect to find anyone alive”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Peskov told reporters. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine will begin using the death penalty in 2025, according to an updated criminal code of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). A Russian proxy court in the DPR sentenced two Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun to death on charges of “terrorism”. The ruling has been condemned as a “sham judgment” in Britain. The new criminal code, in effect from Friday, states that the death penalty should be carried out by firing squad and that the head of the Russian-controlled DPR has the final say on issuing pardons to anybody sentenced to death. It is unclear what the new rules would mean for the captured men, Reuters reports. On Thursday, the European court of human rights (ECHR) said it had issued an order to Russia to ensure that the men do not face the death penalty. In response, the Kremlin said it was not bound by rulings from the ECHR, from which Russia pulled out after its troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The EU’s flag was hoisted in the plenary hall of Ukraine’s parliament after an address by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. During her speech, Von der Leyen congratulated Ukraine on becoming an EU candidate state. “You have gained the endorsement and respect of all EU member states,” she said. Ukraine now has a very clear European perspective, it is a candidate country for the EU. US basketball star Brittney Griner has arrived at a courtroom on the outskirts of Moscow for the beginning of her criminal trial, more than four months after she was arrested at an airport for cannabis possession. Griner, 31, was seen wearing a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt as she arrived at Khimki city court in handcuffs, with US embassy staff in attendance. The Phoenix Mercury star and two-time US Olympic gold medalist could spend 10 years in prison if convicted on charges of large-scale transportation of drugs. The trial will be partially closed and with a limited media presence, which a court spokesperson said was “on the request of the defence, the request of Griner herself”. During his press briefing today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied Griner’s case was politically motivated. Peskov told reporters: I can only operate with known facts, and the facts indicate that the eminent athlete was detained with illegal drugs that contained narcotic substances. There are articles in Russian legislation that provide for punishment for such crimes. Only the court can pass a verdict. At a closed-door preliminary hearing on Monday, the court in Khimki extended Griner’s detention for a further six months after she appeared for a preliminary hearing held behind closed doors. Griner had previously been ordered to remain in pretrial detention until 2 July. Two children were among 19 people killed by a missile strike in Odesa, according to the latest update from regional governor Maksym Marchenko. He said “As a result of a night missile strike by Tu-22 strategic aircraft from the Black Sea in the Belgorod-Dniester district of Odesa region, three X-22 missiles hit an apartment building and a recreation centre. 31 people were hospitalised, including 4 children and a pregnant woman. 8 people were rescued from the rubble, including 3 children. Rescue work continues.” The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the strike. Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said: “There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. He said “Our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.” Ukrainian forces said Thursday they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.” Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference. A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying. Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will guide you through the next few hours of our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Kremlin has dismissed allegations that Russian missiles had struck an apartment building near the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa early on Friday. Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had hit an apartment building and recreation centres, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens. Regional governor Maksym Marchenko said the dead included two children. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters, according to Reuters. Last year, Peskov described suggestions that Russia was planning to attack Ukraine as a “hollow and unfounded” invention of the western media, and prior to Russia’s latest invasion in February, he said Russian troops taking part in military exercises in Belarus would be “pulled back to their permanent bases” after their conclusion. Instead, they advanced into northern Ukraine from 24 February in an apparent attempt to capture Kyiv. The European Union said Russia’s threat to sever diplomatic ties with Bulgaria in response to its decision to expel 70 Russian diplomats is unjustified. Reuters reports the EU said Bulgaria’s action was “fully in line with international law”, as the diplomats of the Russian embassy were acting in violation with international treaties. “The European Union stands in full support and solidarity with Bulgaria in these circumstances and will follow this matter closely,” the EU said in a statement. Bulgaria’s outgoing prime minister on Thursday already called on Russia to withdraw its diplomatic ultimatum, which included a threat to close Russia’s embassy in the Balkan nation. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been visiting Belarus, where he declared: “We stand for unconditional respect for international law.” The Russian foreign ministry has just posted some text on Telegram to promote his remarks from yesterday, saying: The future world order is at stake. We will go back to the origins and observe in practice the UN charter principles, above all the principle of sovereign equality of states, or else the world will be plunged into chaos for a long time. Our choice is clear: We stand for unconditional respect for international law. We will uphold this position together with our Belarusian allies and our other numerous likeminded partners who share these approaches, which was confirmed during the recent Brics summit and in the final documents adopted at this summit. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in Ukraine has issued its military update for the day. It claims that “at present, the DPR and Luhansk People’s Republic troops, with fire support from the Russian Federation armed forces, have liberated 240 settlements”. That is an increase of one on the 239 settlements that their briefing had been claiming for some days. It claims Ukrainian forces have shelled 16 settlements that are under DPR occupation, that seven people were injured, 34 housing constructions and 11 civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia and Syria are the only two UN member states to recognise the DPR as a legitimate authority. This is a selection of the latest images that have been sent to us of the aftermath of the missile attack on Odesa which, according to governor Maksym Marchenko, has claimed 18 lives and left more than 30 people in hospital. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. In response to events in Ukraine’s parliament this morning, where president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen addressed lawmakers by video, Ukraine’s president has posted to Telegram: Today, together with the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the prime minister, we are signing a joint statement, which is a signal of unity of all branches of government and evidence of our determination to achieve Ukraine’s strategic goal of full membership in the European Union. And signing this statement should mean the same as signing an application to join on the fifth day of the war. We went to the candidacy for 115 days. And our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way. This was the scene this morning as the European Union flag was brought into Ukraine’s parliament. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s ambassador to Ukraine, described it on Twitter as “moving to tears”. Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said: Ukraine is a candidate country to join the European Union, something that seemed almost unimaginable just five months ago. There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union. The next steps are within your reach. But they will require hard work. Reuters reports she listed among urgent required measures: the adoption of a media law, the implementation of new rules that reduce oligarchs’ excessive clout and the appointment of top anti-corruption officials. Ruslan Stefanchuk, chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, has tweeted his pride at the European Union flag being flown within it, after it was addressed on video by president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. He wrote: A historic moment! The flag of the European Union now in the Ukrainian parliament. It was my dream. It came true. And I will add: the Verkhovna Rada deserves the EU flag both in colour and in meaning. Ukraine was accepted as a candidate country for European Union membership on 23 June. Rodion Miroshnik, the ambassador to Russia for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), has been active on Telegram this morning. Firstly he boasted that “even in the Ukrainian general staff there comes an epiphany that they will soon completely lose control over the territory of the LPR”. He then went on to say: “it is decided that the boots of the Ukrainian Nazi will forever leave the territory of the LPR.” He also posted a news story suggesting that an area in Moscow may be renamed after the LPR, possibly at the location of the western embassies in Russia’s capital city. Miroshnik comments: “Personally, I like the British embassy on Luhansk People’s Republic Square. I think Liz Truss is very impressive. You can’t deprive her of such pleasure.” Several countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, Sweden and Canada, have renamed streets near Russian embassies or consulates in honour of Ukraine. The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic was formed in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, and Russia and Syria are the only two UN member states that recognise it is as a legitimate authority. Ukraine now has a “very clear European perspective” following the European Union’s decision to grant the country candidate status to join the bloc, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. “Ukraine now has a very clear European perspective. And Ukraine is a candidate country to join the European Union, something that seemed almost unimaginable just five months ago,” Von der Leyen said in a speech by video-link to the assembly on Friday. “So today is first and foremost. A moment to celebrate this historic milestone, a victory of determination and resolve and a victory for the whole movement that started eight years ago on the Maidan,” Reuters reports she added. The north-eastern region of Sumy in Ukraine had a peaceful night, according to a status update from regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, but he reports on Telegram that shelling resumed in the morning on the Esman community. There are, he said, no casualties. Two children are among 18 people killed by a missile strike in Odesa, according to the latest update from regional governor Maksym Marchenko. He posted to Telegram to say: As a result of a night missile strike by Tu-22 strategic aircraft from the Black Sea in the Belgorod-Dniester district of Odesa region, three X-22 missiles hit an apartment building and a recreation centre. As of 9am, 18 victims were identified, including 2 children, and 31 people were hospitalised, including 4 children and a pregnant woman. Another 8 sought medical help. 8 people were rescued from the rubble, including 3 children. Rescue work continues. Earlier, Ukrainian MP Roman Hryshchuk shared a video purportedly from the attack, saying “Just imagine: you wake up and realise that there is no way out. People were trapped in their own apartments after Russian missiles hit a residential high-rise in Odesa.” The claims have not been independently verified. A quick snap from Reuters here that Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible. The US has not seen China evade sanctions or provide military equipment to Russia, a senior US official said on Thursday. The Commerce Department previously added five companies in China to a trade blacklist on Tuesday for allegedly supporting Russia’s military and defence industrial base. Reuters reportS US officials have warned of consequences, including sanctions, should China offer material support for Russia’s war effort, but have consistently said they have yet to detect overt Chinese military and economic backing of Moscow. China is not providing material support. This is normal course-of-business enforcement action against entities that have been backfilling for Russia,” a senior Biden administration official told Reuters, referring to the Commerce blacklist. We have not seen the PRC (People’s Republic of China) engage in systematic evasion or provide military equipment to Russia,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update for the last 24 hours in his region, detailing a list of areas which have been shelled. He claims that the port area of Mykolaiv was hit with “forbidden cluster shells”. He did not list any people being killed or injured in the ten areas he said had come under fire, but there were some areas he said “victims and consequences” are being clarified. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the launching of power transmissions to Romania was the start of a process that could help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian hydrocarbons. Zelenskiy’s comments in his nightly video message on Thursday followed an announcement by prime minister Denys Shmyhal that exports had started earlier in the day – with a volume of 100 megawatts – four months into Russia’s war on Ukraine. The president said the start of exports was “another significant step in our movement toward the European Union”. Thanks to Ukrainian electricity, a significant part of the Russian gas used by European consumers can be replaced. This is therefore not just a question of export earnings for us but a question of security for all of Europe. Let me remind you that linking our country to the common EU energy system took place already after the war began. Ukraine is doing things now that once seemed impossible.” Ukraine reached agreement in mid-March to join the European Network of Transmission System Operators (Entso-E) as an observer after its grid was linked to that of the EU. The Entso-E said this week that preparations had been completed for the first exports from Ukraine, together with power from ex-Soviet state Moldova, starting on 30 June – using an interconnection with Romania. Electricity trading on other interconnections between Ukraine and Slovakia and Ukraine and Hungary – as well as between Moldova and Romania would soon follow, it said. The group said the total trade capacity would initially be set to 100MW in the first phase. In his earlier announcement, Shmyhal said Ukraine’s electricity export potential towards Europe could reach 2.5 gigawatts. Satellite images shows smoke rising from Snake Island, off the coast of Ukraine, on Thursday. Ukrainian forces say they pushed Russian forces from the strategic Black Sea island. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea island off the southern coast near the city of Odesa. Russia portrayed the pullout from Snake Island off the port city of Odesa as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. Ukraine’s win will weaken any plans Russia may have for a future land attack on that stretch of coastline, Ukrainian officials say. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, said Ukrainian-made Bohdana howitzers had played an important role in routing Russian forces from Snake Island, and he thanked foreign partners for their support. “KABOOM!” Tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration. “No more Russian troops on Snake Island.” Russia’s ministry of defence stated that it had completed its assigned tasks and was tactically withdrawing to allow for grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. “In order to organise humanitarian grain corridors as part of the implementation of joint agreements reached with the participation of the UN, the Russian Federation decided to leave its positions on Zmiinyi Island,” the ministry said. Yermak described Russia’s claim of goodwill as a lie. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier hailed a victory over Russian forces occupying Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea island off the southern coast near the city of Odesa. He said Zmiinyi Island – or Snake Island – was “free” after Russian forces withdrew from the strategic post. Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, and it significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea. It does not guarantee safety yet, it does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already limits the actions of the occupiers significantly. Step by step, we will drive them out of our sea, our land, and our sky.” Snake Island was made famous when Russia first captured it in February. A Ukrainian soldier posted on the island told an attacking Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”, which has become one of the most popular Ukrainian slogans of resistance since the invasion. At least 17 people have been killed after two Russian missiles struck a multi-storey apartment building and a recreation centre in the southern port city of Odesa in the early hours of Friday, Ukrainian officials have said. Ukraine’s state emergency services (SES) said that as of 6am on Friday, 14 people had been killed and 30 injured – including three children – in the attack on the apartment building. Three people – including a child – were killed in a seperate attack on a recreation centre, with one injured, said the SES. The Guardian could not immediately confirm details of the incident. Ukrainian MP, Roman Hryshchuk, shared a video purportedly from the attack. “Just imagine: you wake up and realise that there is no way out. People were trapped in their own apartments after Russian missiles hit a residential high-rise in Odesa,” he wrote alongside the video. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you as we unpack all the latest news from Ukraine this morning. Major developments overnight include a victory over Snake Island where Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops from the strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast near the city of Odesa. Russia portrayed the pullout from Snake Island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. And in the early hours of this morning, two Russian missiles reportedly struck a multi-storey apartment building and a recreation centre in Odesa. At least 17 people were killed, Ukrainian officials have said. Here are all the latest lines as of 8am in Kyiv. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.” Ukrainian forces say they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats following a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. A Russian missile struck a multi-story apartment building in Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa early on Friday, killing at least 10 people, a local official said. “The number of dead as a result of a strike on a multi-story apartment building has now risen to 10,” Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa regional administration said on his Telegram channel. The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting. Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference. A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying. Joe Biden declared that the US and Nato allies will stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” as the military alliance promised hundreds of thousands more troops to defend eastern Europe. The US president also announced another $800m of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained over how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday. Following the Nato summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said leaders had decided to support Kyiv “to make sure Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state in Europe”. Turkey’s president has warned that Ankara could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that if the two Nordic countries reneged on their promises, including to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday. Estonian and Latvian defence ministers signed a letter of intent on Thursday at the Nato summit in Madrid for joint procurement of medium-range anti-aircraft systems.“The aggression of Russia in Ukraine clearly shows the need for air defence systems,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a statement. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would deliver six Caesar howitzers and a “significant number” of armoured vehicles to Ukraine. He added that the Nato allies meeting in Madrid “unanimously decided” to boost humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Asked whether the British government believed Russia could be pushed out of all of Ukraine within a foreseeable timeframe, Truss replied: “It is realistic, and that is why we are supplying the extra lethal aid we’re supplying.” Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, to protest against Boris Johnson’s “offensive” remarks regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”, it said in a statement. Norway’s foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday, Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Huitfeldt said Norway was not blocking Russian access to the Arctic archipelago, only applying international sanctions, and that Russia had other means to reach its settlements. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Moscow, where he will urge Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire and seek ways to allow the export of grain from Ukraine. Widodo also met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday during a visit he described as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/19/new-south-korean-president-vows-to-end-use-of-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T08:49:57Z","webTitle":"New South Korean president vows to end use of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/new-south-korean-president-vows-to-end-use-of-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/19/new-south-korean-president-vows-to-end-use-of-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"New South Korean president vows to end use of nuclear power","bodyText":"South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, has vowed to phase out the country’s dependence on nuclear power, warning of “unimaginable consequences” from a Fukushima-style meltdown. Moon, a left-leaning liberal who won last month’s presidential election by a landslide following the impeachment and arrest of Park Geun-hye, said he would increase the role of renewable energy and lead South Korea towards a “nuclear-free era”. Speaking at an event to mark the closure of the country’s oldest nuclear plant, Kori-1, he said: “So far, South Korea’s energy policy pursued cheap prices and efficiency. “Cheap production prices were considered the priority while the public’s life and safety took a back seat. But it’s time for a change. “We will abolish our nuclear-centred energy policy and move towards a nuclear-free era. We will completely scrap construction plans for new nuclear reactors that are currently under way.” Moon added that he would not extend the operation of ageing reactors, many of which will come to the end of their lifespans between 2020 and 2030. Weaning South Korea off nuclear power, however, could take decades, and there is expected to be opposition from construction companies, which have increased technology exports under Moon’s nuclear-friendly predecessors. The country was the fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy last year, according to the World Nuclear Association, with its 25 reactors generating about a third of its electricity. The former president Lee Myung-bak saw nuclear as an important source of clean energy, while Park wanted to increase the number of reactors to 36 by 2029. Moon recognised the role of nuclear power in South Korea’s rapid economic development, but added that Japan’s Fukushima disaster – which prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands of people – had convinced him that his country must look to new sources of energy. “The country’s economic status has changed, our awareness on the importance of the environment has changed. The notion that the safety and lives of people are more important than anything else has become a firm social consensus,” he said. Anti-nuclear campaigners have long warned of the potentially disastrous consequences of a meltdown at a nuclear plant in South Korea, where many reactors are close to densely populated areas. The public’s support for nuclear power has weakened since the 2011 Fukushima meltdown and a 2013 corruption scandal over fake safety certificates for reactor parts. “The Fukushima nuclear accident has clearly proved that nuclear reactors are neither safe, economical nor environmentally friendly,” Yonhap news agency quoted Moon as saying. “South Korea is not safe from the risk of earthquakes, and a nuclear accident caused by a quake can have such a devastating impact.” He also plans to close at least 10 ageing coal-fired power plants before his term ends in 2022 and to boost renewables’ share of the energy mix to 20% by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-james-lovelock-earth-but-not-as-we-knew-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-25T17:20:20Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on James Lovelock: Earth, but not as we knew it | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-james-lovelock-earth-but-not-as-we-knew-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-james-lovelock-earth-but-not-as-we-knew-it","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on James Lovelock: Earth, but not as we knew it","bodyText":"James Lovelock, the scientist and writer, is 100 years old on Friday and remains a combination of environmental Cassandra and Old Testament prophet. Unlike them, though, he changes his mind about what the future holds. Foolish consistency, Emerson wrote, is the hobgoblin of little minds, and Dr Lovelock’s mind is not little. More than 10 years before the record high July temperatures, Dr Lovelock flatly told the Guardian that 80% of human life on Earth would perish by 2100 because of the climate emergency. He imagined a dystopian end of humanity where “the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable” by the end of the 21st century. As a scientist (his first letter to Nature was published in 1945, on the subject of writing on petri dishes), Dr Lovelock’s life has been studded with insight. He invented an electron capture detector that could pick up minute traces of pollutants – such as the pesticides that spurred Rachel Carson to write the 1962 book Silent Spring. At home he built instruments that ended up on Mars, helping Nasa to establish that the red planet was lifeless. Dr Lovelock’s imagination has not narrowed, but his vision has become bleaker with time. His new book Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence proposes that the 300,000-year Anthropocene era of Earth’s human domination is ending. Novacene is a new age where our species is doomed to a worse fate than clinging on for dear life at the north pole as previously imagined. Instead we will become lackeys of cyborgs able to think 10,000 times faster than humans. We will be kept on to ensure there are habitable temperatures for these superior intelligences. Novacene’s thesis is a straight-line extrapolation of Dr Lovelock’s breakthrough idea which he began to develop while a consultant at Nasa in the 1970s; the thought that the planet was a superorganism. In 1974, he and biologist Lynn Margulis proposed the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is in some way alive. The paper suggested our planet metabolises and responds to changes in its environment to survive. In bestselling books such as The Revenge of Gaia, Dr Lovelock argued that humans have exploited Earth and the “old lady” would eliminate us unless we treated her with greater reverence. That is why the Novacene will start, he now reasons: because a superintelligence will recognise that all living tissue will be consumed by climate crisis and will act with Gaia to keep the life going. When it came out, the Gaia theory immediately chimed with the incipient green movement. Tough-minded scientists, though, initially reacted as if – as one critic put it – Dr Lovelock had let off a bad smell at the vicar’s tea party. Its appeal, they wrongly sneered, was to devotees of faith-healing and mysticism. But Dr Lovelock has stuck to his guns and refused to be co-opted by environmentalism. He backs nuclear power and has zigzagged on global heating, saying that some alarmist books – including his own – had made unwarranted predictions. He even told the Guardian: “We’ve got to really make it clear to those very silly people who think we can save the planet to cease and desist.” And what of the Gaia hypothesis? Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described it as “a metaphor not a mechanism”. Its truth is poetic not literal. That echoes how Dr Lovelock sees himself. “I’m a romantic,” he said once. “I’m much more of a poet by nature than anything else.” He might be best seen then as a 21st-century William Blake – one whose words are no more testable than verse, but no less valuable for that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-urges-honest-peace-talks-without-delay-russian-forces-tighten-grip-around-mariupol-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T04:25:09Z","webTitle":"190,000 civilians have been evacuated since invasion of Ukraine began – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-urges-honest-peace-talks-without-delay-russian-forces-tighten-grip-around-mariupol-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-urges-honest-peace-talks-without-delay-russian-forces-tighten-grip-around-mariupol-live","fields":{"headline":"190,000 civilians have been evacuated since invasion of Ukraine began – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closing now but you can follow our continuing live coverage here. Below is a summary, thank you for reading. More than 6,600 Ukrainians were evacuated from besieged cities through eight humanitarian corridors on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Thousands of residents of Mariupol have been taken to Russia against their will, where they have been “redirected” to remote cities in the country, the Mariupol city council has said. The UK ministry of defence said Russia has still failed to gain control of the skies over Ukraine. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, says his country is “on the right side of history” as it continues to rail against sanctions imposed on Russia and deny it is considering supplying weapons to Moscow. Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia, in an effort to limit Russia’s munitions production. Australian supplies 20% of Russia’s alumina. Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Boris Johnson has come under heavy criticism for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting to the British public voting for Brexit. Kyiv officials have reported that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in Ukraine’s capitol. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs reported that 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “meaningful, fair” peace talks to take place urgently. He told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine – meaningful, fair and without delay – are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. Zelenskiy also urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said are helping to wage war on Ukraine from the safety of “beautiful Swiss towns”. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 1400 GMT on Saturday (1600 local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year’s sowing season is disrupted by Russia’s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed on with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. China’s foreign minister says the country time will tell that they stand on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis. Reuters reports the minister Wang Yi told reporters on Saturday China had “always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war, and that its position was “objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries”. “Time will prove that China’s claims are on the right side of history,” he said according to a statement published by the ministry. China’s government holds conflicting positions on the war. It has projected itself as a neutral power, saying it respects Ukraine’s sovereignty as well as Russia’s “security concerns”, and says it could mediate. It has refused to condemn Russia’s actions or call it an “invasion”, has voted alongside it at international bodies, and the US has significant concerns it is considering supplying weapons to Russia (which Beijing denies). It has repeatedly objected to the use of economic sanctions against Russia. “China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,” Wang told reporters on Saturday evening. Wang’s comments followed a Friday video call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, during which Biden warned Xi of “consequences” if Beijing gave material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing’s statements about the call, Reuters reported. Russian troops have reportedly stopped a convoy of busses traveling to Mariupol to evacuate residents, according to the Kyiv Independent. Citing the Berdyansk City council, the outlet said the convoy was stopped a few kilometres outside Berdyansk and refused entry into the city limits, and the drivers were not permitted to spend the night. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Berdyansk is about 85km by road from Mariupol, which is under heavy siege by Russian forces. Local authorities have accused Russia of forcibly taking thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia against their will. The New York Times has some more detail on the claims by Mariupol City Council that residents are being taken to Russia against their will. Pyotr Andryuschenko, an assistant to the city’s mayor, accused Russian forces of taking “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog” without their passports. Andryuschenko said thousands of people had been sheltering at a sporting complex in the city centre, and he believed many of those inside were being taken to Russia. Other Mariupol residents said they had heard from friends and neighbors who relayed having been taken across the border without their consent. Eduard Zarubin, a doctor who left the city on Wednesday, said he had been in touch with three families who had been forcibly taken to Taganrog by Russian soldiers. “Now the Russians are walking through the basements, and if there are people left there, they forcibly take them to Taganrog,” Mr. Zarubin, 50, said. In one case, he said, the whole family of one of his friends was taken away, as was the family of his friend’s brother. A senior Chinese government official said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine are increasingly “outrageous”, according to a recent Reuters report. China’s vice foreign minister Le Yucheng also acknowledged Moscow’s point of view on NATO, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards, forcing a nuclear power like Russia “into a corner”. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,” Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets “for no reason”. “History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system... and worsen the global economy.” Beijing decries the use of sanctions in general, as unauthorised and unilateral, but has often used trade as an unofficial diplomatic weapon against countries with which it is in diplomatic dispute, including Lithuania and Australia. China’s government has refused to label Russia’s assault on Ukraine as an “invasion”. It has sought to present itself as a neutral potential mediator, and denied US claims that it is considering a Russian request to supply weapons. However in recent weeks it has repeatedly abstained from voting in multilateral resolutions aimed at Russia, or voting alongside it, including against the International Court of Justice’s recent demand that Russia withdraw its troops. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video address just a short time ago. Here is an excerpt being reported by Ukrainian media. The 24th day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression, Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobayivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, able to simply drive their people to slaughter. Zelenskiy said more than 6,600 people were evacuated through eight humanitarian corridors on Saturday, including from Bervytsia and Bucha. “Due to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to remove people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region,” he said. “More than 4,000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhia.” Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as “unrelenting and illegal aggression” towards Ukraine, reports Christopher Knaus. The country’s federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing. The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia’s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions. Russia relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs. Hello, this is Helen Davidson here to take you through the news developments for the next few hours. Russian cosmonauts on the International Space Station have rejected claims their yellow and blue flight suits are a nod to Ukraine, and have expressed support for their president. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov, of Russian space corporation Roscosmos, docked at the ISS late on Friday. Their uniforms - bright yellow with blue accents, sparked immediate questions about whether it was tacit message of support. Shortly after arriving Artemyev was asked and said the crew had just “accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it”. In a follow up statement published on the Russian space agency’s Telegram channel, he again urged people to not “look for any hidden signs or symbols” in the suits. “A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky. “These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!” He gave a different reason for the choice this time - saying the crew chose the colours of the prestigious Bauman Moscow State Technical University, of which all three are graduates. It’s 2am on Sunday in Ukraine. Here’s a summary of the developments that were seen so far today: Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine.

Stay tuned for more live updates. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondents Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote about why public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is still high, despite hopes from the West that it is waning: There have been efforts from abroad to encourage the Russian people to protest against the war. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week released a nine-minute video in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father’s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. “This is not the Russian people’s war,” he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians. But others in Russia say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion. As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a “Nuremberg 2.0” in Ukraine after the war. “Aren’t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?” Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. “Why don’t you write about them instead?” Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a “war” or the state-sanctioned “military operation” carry political meaning. “We are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. “These two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.” According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians “support Russia’s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine”. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the “military operation”. The most recent intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence says that Russia has still failed to gain control of Ukrainian airspace, one of its main objectives. “Their continued failure to do so has significantly blunted their operational progress,” reads the statement. Kyiv Independent is reporting that a Russian diplomat made vague comments about Russia having plans to confront NATO on Bosnian TV. Residents of Mariupol, which is being continuously bombed by Russia, have been taken to Russia over the last week, the Mariupol city council is reporting. The council said that “several thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia. The occupiers illegally removed people from the Left Bank district and shelters in the building of the sports club, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from constant bombing,” the statement reads. The council said that the residents were taken to “filtration camps, where occupiers checked people’s phones and documents”. After, residents were “redirected to remote cities in Russia, the fate of other remain unknown”. Ukrainian forces have defeated Russia in its initial campaign of the war, according to analysis from DC-based think tank Institute of the Study of War, ultimately leading to a stalemate between the two counties. The institute describes Russia’s strategy as using “airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and other major Ukrainian cities”. “Russian forces continue to make limited advances in some parts of the theater but are very unlikely to be able to seize their objectives in this way,” the analysis reads. The fall of Mariupol is “unlikely” to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. The analysis notes that the Russia military continues to focus on localized fighting rather than launching large-scale operations. It concludes that there is a stalemate throughout most of Ukraine that, if continued, will “likely be very violent and bloody”. The Kyiv Independent reported today that Russia is illegally forcing untrained men living in the Russian-controlled Donbas region to fight and putting them on the frontlines. “These people have never even held a machine gun in their hands,” said Oleksii, a 24-year-old resident of Russian-occupied Khrestivka in Donetsk, speaking of friends, classmates and former colleagues that he knows have been conscripted. One Donbas resident named Anastasia told the news outlet that these civilians from Donbas are forced to serve in frontline positions, with Russian forces threatening to shoot them if they don’t comply. Journalist Neil Hauer, a freelancer journalist reporting in Kyiv, has an interesting Twitter thread about the intensifying anti-Russian sentiment among Ukrainians that is directed at the average Russian, not just Vladimir Putin. A video of a police officer in Mariupol, where fighting has been intensifying, is starting to circulate. The officer, Michail Vershnin, directs his pleas to Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, saying that his city has been “wiped off the face of the earth”. “Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it has been wiped off the face of the earth,” he said in Russian in the video filmed on Friday. “You have promised that there will be help, give us that help. Biden, Macron, you are great leaders. Be them to the end,” he said. The frontman of one of Ukrainian’s biggest bands, BoomBox, went viral at the beginning of the war with an Instagram video of him singing a Ukrainian freedom fighter song. Reposted on Twitter by Buzzfeed journalist Christopher Miller, Andriy Khlyvnyuk can be seen in uniform with a rifle. Instead of going on a US and Canadian tour, Khlyvnyuk, like many Ukrainian celebrities, chose to stay in his country to fight. “This is my duty. Ukraine is my home,” Khlyvnyuk told Buzzfeed’s Miller. “And it’s not that easy to push me out of my home.” Kyiv officials have just said that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in the Ukrainian capital since the invasion began. Earlier today, Ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry reported about 14,400 Russian personnel killed as of Saturday. This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over for Nadeem Badshah. Earlier today, Pope Francis paid a visit to a ward in the Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome that is treating Ukrainian refugee children. The children are undergoing treatment for illnesses like cancer or neurological diseases, according to the Catholic News Agency. The hospital has treated 50 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, including 19 children who were brought in for treatment on Saturday. In a message to a gathering of European Catholic representatives yesterday, the Pope denounced the “perverse abuse of power” in Ukraine and said that Ukrainians have been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and are “defending their land”. While the Pope clearly denounced the war, he did not speak of Russia as an aggressor during his speech. Two weeks ago, Alani Iyanuoluwa fled Kyiv as the Russian invasion intensified. Making her way across Europe, the 24-year-old hoped to be reunited with family in London. Yet for 10 days she has been stranded in a French port – because she is Nigerian. Iyanuoluwa is among a growing number of refugees who claim the British government is ignoring black people who fled Ukraine. Their experiences have again raised the issue of race and the UK’s welcome to refugees, prompting claims that ministers would never have unveiled last week’s humanitarian sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians had it not been aimed at white Europeans. Boris Johnson has been criticised for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to British people voting for Brexit. In his speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom”, with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”. The comparison was condemned by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the EU. Writing on Twitter, he said: “Apart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn’t in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion + the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on.” Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Prime Minister “is a national embarrassment”, adding: “To compare a referendum to women and children fleeing (Vladimir) Putin’s bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: “Boris Johnson’s comments comparing Ukraine’s life-threatening situation with Brexit was crass and distasteful, and shows just how dangerously obsessed the Tories are with Brexit.” Read our full story here: The governor of Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region said rescue work was ongoing at the site of an air strike on a facility where Ukrainian soldiers had been sleeping. Speaking on national television, governor Vitaliy Kim said the attack took place on Friday but gave no further detail about the location or the number of possible casualties. Local media reported the strike hit a barracks in the regional capital, Reuter reports. Ukrainian mothers and their young children found shelter in an ornate theatre in the Polish border town of Przemysl on Saturday, Reuters reports. For Tanya, a 34-year-old from Berdychiv in northern Ukraine, it was a relief to finally have some help with her five young children after their long trip to Poland. Tanya, who did not give her last name, had stayed in her home until it was no longer possible to shield her children from the war. “I tried to protect them from all of this. When the alarm sounded, I covered the windows with blankets so one couldn’t hear it. My small ones made up a monster, the siren monster,” she said. Her children ran around her as she stood inside the theatre, which is tucked inside the Polish city’s Ukrainian cultural centre. There were about 50 refugees sleeping side by side under borrowed blankets on fold-out cots in the theatre. The UK’s transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said another plane has been grounded because of possible links to Russia. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said were helping to wage war on his country from the safety of “beautiful Swiss towns”. In an audiolink address to thousands attending an anti-war protest in Bern, Zelenskiy thanked Switzerland for its support since Russia launched its invasion, but speaking through a translator he also said: Your banks are where the money of the people who unleashed this war lies. That is painful. That is also a fight against evil, that their accounts are frozen. That would also be a fight, and you can do this. Ukrainians feel what it is when cities are destroyed. They are being destroyed on the orders of people who live in European, in beautiful Swiss towns, who enjoy property in your cities. It would really be good to strip them of this privilege. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has fully adopted the bloc’s sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, including orders to freeze their wealth in Swiss banks. Ukraine has evacuated 190,000 civilians from frontline areas via humanitarian corridors since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said corridors in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions were functioning on Saturday, but a planned corridor to the besieged eastern port city of Mariupol was only partially operational, with Russian troops not allowing buses through. Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Boris Johnson has spoken of the beginning of a “new age of intimidation” stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his invasion of Ukraine. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “meaningful, fair” peace talks to take place urgently. He told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine – meaningful, fair and without delay – are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 1400 GMT on Saturday (1600 local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year’s sowing season is disrupted by Russia’s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed on with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over this liveblog shortly. From CNN anchor and chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto: Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday it had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia’s deployment of hypersonic missiles was a warning to Ukraine and the west that it “has the means to escalate” the conflict further, defence expert Dr James Bosbotinis said. Russia’s space agency has rejected western media reports suggesting Russian cosmonauts joining the International Space Station (ISS) wore wear yellow suits with a blue accents in support of Ukraine. “Sometimes yellow is just yellow,” Roscosmos’ press service said on its Telegram channel. “The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from ... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.” When asked about the suits during a live-streamed news conference from the ISS on Friday, mission commander Oleg Artemyev said: “Every crew picks a colour that looks different. It was our turn to pick a colour. The truth is, we had accumulated a lot of yellow fabric, so we needed to use it up. That’s why we had to wear yellow flight suits.” Activists in Kazakhstan have said they were refused permission to hold a protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to AFP. Kazakhstan is seeking a third way amid the war in Ukraine, attempting to distance itself from the Kremlin’s actions while not antagonising Moscow. The foreign ministry last month signalled its neutrality in the conflict over Ukraine, saying it is not considering recognition of two Russia-backed separatist entities in eastern Ukraine. Although Kazakh authorities permitted activists in the former capital Almaty to hold a rally of more than 2,000 people demonstrating against the invasion earlier this month, they were blocked from putting on a second rally. Authorities in the country strictly control demonstrations, only allowing them to take place in designated locations with permission. Activists showed AFP a letter from the Almaty mayor’s office refusing them permission to hold a second demonstration, explaining a square designated for demonstrations was being used for a rally in support of Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev instead. “In reality they only held (the demonstration) to prevent us from holding our anti-war meeting,” activist Alnur Ilyashev told AFP, explaining they had “booked” the square for the whole day, meaning it would not be free for other rallies even after they left. Russia’s deployment of hypersonic missiles was a warning to Ukraine and the west that it “has the means to escalate” the conflict further, a defence expert has said. Dr James Bosbotinis, a specialist in defence and international affairs, told the BBC it was not possible for the Ukrainian army to defend itself against attacks by these missiles. “The speed of the Kinzhal puts it beyond the reach of any Ukrainian air defence system and the launch platforms can launch from ranges beyond the reach of Ukraine,” he said, adding that the hypersonic missile was probably launched from southern Russia. Bosbotinis said hitting the “high-value target” of an underground military depot was “sending the message to Ukraine that Russia has the means to escalate this conflict further ... It’s also a warning to the west that Russia can of course, up the ante in Ukraine and the Kinzhal could also be deployed if the war escalated and drew in external powers.” He said it was “messaging” that Russia could hit targets in other parts of Europe. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “meaningful and fair” peace talks over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia’s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.” “The war must end,” he added. “Ukraine’s proposals are on the table.” The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, has said his country will take care of the “wives and children” fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven about 3 million Ukrainians to seek refuge in the EU’s eastern flank. Fiala, who travelled to Kyiv earlier this week with his Polish and Slovenian counterparts to meet Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added that the Czech Republic could cope with further refugee arrivals from Ukraine. With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, mostly women and children have crossed into the European Union at border points in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. “I have informed Ukrainian friends that we will take care of their wives and children,” Fiala said on Twitter. “The speed and size of the refugee wave is incomparable with past waves but the Czech Republic can (handle) it.” Echoing the concerns of other leaders in the region, Fiala said countries receiving large numbers of refugees should receive EU financial support but voiced opposition to quotas. “We do not want the EU to introduce quotas but to have financial solidarity with the countries most affected by the refugee wave,” he said. Poland, which shares a roughly 500km (310-mile) border with Ukraine, has received more than 2 million of the refugee arrivals. The deputy mayor of Przemyśl, a town near Poland’s busiest crossing with Ukraine, said the flow of refugees had eased, but cautioned that further Russian military attacks in western Ukraine could change the situation quickly. “Most of the people who left eastern Ukraine are now in western Ukraine waiting for further developments,” the deputy mayor Bogusław Świeży said. “Any nervousness occurring in western Ukraine will result in an increase in the stream of people coming to Poland.” Boris Johnson said it was a “tragedy” that the lack of democracy in Russia meant Vladimir Putin was not challenged as he launched his “disastrous” invasion. Johnson said: I don’t believe that democratic freedoms are going to sprout any time soon in the Kremlin, far from it. But with every day that passes I think that Putin becomes a more glaring advertisement for the system that he hates and despises, and it becomes ever more obvious why we have to stick up for Ukraine. The prime minister said that “if Putin had a free press, if he had the BBC on his case ... whatever you may think, he would have known the truth – or a version of it”. As Tory activists laughed at the jibe aimed at the BBC, Johnson continued: If he had free, impartial responsible journalism, let me put it that way, then he would have known the truth that the Ukrainians are a proud, proud nation with a charismatic leader. And he would have known, before he set out on this disastrous and inhuman venture, that they would fight to defend their homeland, he would have known that. In a real democracy Putin would not have “locked himself in this echo chamber of sycophants” because he would have to face a “real parliament with real backbenchers” who had to face an electorate. In those circumstances “I don’t believe that he would have been capable of such a crescendo of disastrous and self-destructive mistakes,” Johnson added. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year’s sowing campaigns are disrupted by Russia’s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. “Ukraine has enough grain and food reserves to survive for a year, but if the war continues ... [Ukraine] will not be able to export grain to the world, and there will be problems,” he said, adding that Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter. Boris Johnson thanked the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, for urging him to “read Putin’s crazy essay” several months ago, ahead of the invasion. He said the pair, along with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, spoke daily about the situation in Ukraine. “We are talking continuously, Liz, Ben and I, to our colleagues in the Ukraine support group to discuss what more we can do. And those conversations are literally every day and there will be more,” he told the Conservative conference. He said he was “proud” of what the UK did on sanctions, adding: “We must sanction more banks and individuals than any other European country ... there is, of course, a cost to all these actions. Of course there is. But the cost of doing nothing will be far higher.” He described Putin as a “a backstreet pusher, feeding addiction, creating dependence” on Russia’s gas and oil. “Putin’s war is intended to cause economic damage to the west and to benefit him,” he told the conference. He knows that with every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil, he gets billions more in revenues from the sales of either oil and gas, and that’s the tragedy of the situation. Now he wants to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living, hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills, so we must respond. A “new age of intimidation” stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea looms if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson has warned. Johnson said the world was at a “turning point”: The end of freedom in Ukraine will mean the extinction of any hope of freedom in Georgia and then Moldova. It will mean the beginning of a new age of intimidation across the whole of Eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea. If Putin succeeding crushing Ukraine, it will be the green light for autocrats everywhere in the Middle East, in the Far East. This is a turning point for the world. It’s a moment of choice. It’s a choice between freedom and oppression. He warned other leaders against adopting a stance of “realpolitik” towards Putin. “I know there are some others around the world who say it’s better to make accommodation with tyranny. I believe they are profoundly wrong,” Johnson said. To try to normalise relations with Putin after this, as the west had done in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea, would be to make exactly the same mistake again, he added. Vladimir Putin made a “catastrophic mistake” in invading Ukraine, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool, the UK prime minister said the country stood with the people of Ukraine. “With every day that Ukraine’s heroic resistance continues, it is clear that Putin has made a catastrophic mistake,” he said. Johnson questioned why Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rejecting the idea that it was over concerns about the country joining Nato. “He was frightened of Ukraine, because in Ukraine, they have a free press. And in Ukraine, they had free elections and with every year Ukraine has progressed, not always easily, towards freedom and democracy and open markets, he feared the Ukrainian example, and he feared the implicit reproach to himself,” Johnson said. The prime minister contrasted this with the situation in Russia. “In Putin’s Russia, you get jailed for 15 years just for calling an invasion an invasion. And if you stand against Putin in an election, you get poisoned or shot.” He said Putin felt threatened by Ukraine because the two countries had been “so historically close”. It is vital that Moscow’s invasion fails, Johnson said, because “a victorious Putin will not stop in Ukraine”. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme has said. The UN agency’s emergency coordinator, Jakob Kern, told AFP that “the challenge is to get to the cities that are encircled or about to be encircled”, describing the situation as dire. He said it has been almost impossible to deliver emergency supplies to the besieged port city of Mariupol or the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. He said it was a tactic that was unacceptable in the 21st century. Replacing broken food supply chains amid fighting is a “mammoth task”, he said. The WFP is aiming to reach 3.1 million people in Ukraine, but efforts have been hindered by difficulties in finding willing truck drivers. Hundreds of thousands of women and children are among those trapped. “The closer you go to these cities, the more worried they are about their safety,” Kern said. “And that means we’re not able to reach these people in Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, in the cities that are almost encircled by now - or completely in the case of Mariupol.” Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents – the colours of the Ukrainian flag: A total of 816 Ukrainian civilians have been confirmed to have been killed and 1,333 injured since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, according to the UN human rights office. However, as it only reports counts that it can verify, it believes the figures vastly understate the actual toll. Ukrainian officials say thousands have been killed. The Associated Press reports that the office of the country’s prosecutor general said that a total of 112 children have been killed since the start of the fighting. More than 140 children have been wounded. The UK Home Office has said 8,600 visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by 5pm on Friday. The announcement comes amid frustration with the length of time the Home Office is taking to process visas. At least 43,000 have applied for Ukraine family scheme visas and are waiting for their applications to be approved, with many staying in hotels in countries bordering Ukraine. Poland has proposed that the European Union implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said in a statement reported by Reuters. Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, [including] both of its seaports ... but also a ban on land trade. Fully cutting off Russia’s trade would further force Russia to consider whether it would be better to stop this cruel war,” Morawiecki said. Poland’s call for Moscow to face tougher economic repercussions for its invasion of Ukraine comes after EU member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia this week. Details were not disclosed, but the French presidency said Russia’s “most-favoured nation” trade status would be revoked. Street fighting in the centre of Mariupol is preventing the rescue of hundreds of civilians trapped in the basement of a theatre that Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia on Wednesday, according to the city’s mayor. Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that rescue teams could help people out of the wreckage only during periods when the fighting subsided. “There are tanks ... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,” he told the broadcaster. “Our forces are doing everything they can to hold their position in the city, but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.” On Friday, Mariupol authorities said 130 had escaped but that more than 1,000 remained in the theatre’s basement. Russia denies bombing the theatre. The Ukrainian army has not observed any significant shifts in the past 24 hours in front line areas, the presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said in a statement reported by Reuters. Fighting continues, Arestovych said in an online video address. He named the following as hotspots for the Russian offensive: The south-eastern city of Mariupol The southern cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson The eastern town of Izyum The former head of the British armed forces has backed calls for Vladimir Putin to face a “Nuremberg-type trial” due to Russia’s “morally indefensible tactic” of attacking Ukrainian civilians. Discussing the role of morale plays in wars, Lord Richard Dannatt told BBC Breakfast that it had a “huge bearing on what happens on the ground”. He said: When we talk about fighting power, there are three components – there’s the physical component (the tanks, the aircraft, the equipment), there’s the conceptual components (the plans the generals come up with) but then there’s the morale component – that’s the will of the soldiers to fight. He contrasted the situation that Russian troops had been led to expect when they invaded Ukraine with the reality. “We understand that they were briefed really poorly, that they would go, that they’d be moving quickly, they’d be welcomed as peacekeepers and liberators, but in fact what they found was that the Ukrainian armed forces, Ukrainian civilians were fighting resolutely against them. These young men are absolutely confused, many of them are very young, frightened, exhausted from weeks of exercising.” The morale of Russian troops had been further weakened by a failure in the army’s logistics systems, Dannatt said: These young men, not only frightened, are now hungry, the fuel for their tanks is not available, so they’ve been placed in a terrible situation. It’s therefore no surprise the Russian army has not made progress on the ground. They’ve had to resort now to this morally indefensible tactic of shelling defenceless civilians.” Dannatt agreed with calls from Gordon Brown and others for Putin to not only be indicted, but for “a Nuremberg-type trial to be set up, to absolutely condemn, for all time, into the history books, what Putin and his generals have been doing”. Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine after failing to “fatally weaken” the country with its annexation of Crimea and war in the Donbas, the UK’s former ambassador to Ukraine has said. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Simon Smith discussed the “background” to Putin’s “full-scale” invasion of Ukraine, saying: I think in 2013-14, a lot of us saw what Russia was doing then as a start of Russia’s war on Ukraine – it isn’t a war that just started in February this year. Because what Putin was after in annexing Crimea and instigating the war in the Donbas was fatally weakening Ukraine, inflicting such damage on Ukraine, damaging its systems and institutions, damaging its confidence to an extent that Ukraine would not be fit to operate as a viable sovereign country. What we saw in the 7-8 years following, was the fact that Putin failed in that objective, that Ukraine did remarkably well in staying on its feet, reforming a lot of institutions and actually making itself a more viable and successful country. Here are some images from the past 24 hours. In Lviv on Friday, prams were arranged in neat rows across Rynok Square, in a display that symbolised the tragic cost of the war. The prams represent each of the 109 children Ukrainian officials say have died so far in Russia’s war on Ukraine. In Kyiv, officials said on Friday that 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. More than 3.2 million have left Ukraine since the start of the war. Many - more than 2 million - have travelled to Poland, according to UNHCR. On Friday, families queued for food near the Central Station in Warsaw. Christine Goyer, the UN refugee agency’s Representative in Poland, said there had been a “tremendous effort from the people, local communities, municipalities and government of Poland in receiving and hosting new arrivals.” On Friday night in Moscow, Vladimir Putin praised Russian “unity” over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine, during a rare public speech. His five-minute address at the Luzhniki stadium was, however, cut short due to a “technical failure” and so re-aired from start. Many attending the Moscow rally were seen waving flags emblazoned with the letter Z, a military marking that has become a symbol of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia will be under a 38-hour curfew beginning at 2pm GMT on Saturday (4pm local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday, the deputy mayor Anatoliy Kurtiev said in a statement reported by Reuters. “Do not go outside at this time!” he said in an online post. The city has become an important route for some of the 35,000 people estimated to have escaped the siege of Mariupol. Ten humanitarian corridors have been agreed on with Russian for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Reuters reports that Vereshchuk said a corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, although the authorities’ previous efforts to evacuate civilians there under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed, with both sides trading blame. About 350,000 civilians are stranded in the city with little food or water. Several corridors have also been agreed in Kyiv and in the Luhansk region. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons - which travel so fast they can evade detection by missile defence systems - to destory an underground military depot in western Ukraine. The claim has not been verified. In a video address the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “meaningful, fair” peace talks were needed urgently. He warned Moscow that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine – meaningful, fair and without delay – are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. The US president, Joe Biden, warned China’s president, Xi Jinping, that there will be “implications and consequences” if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities, the White House said. Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack during the two hour call on Friday. On Friday, fighting reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water. The Russian defence ministry said its forces were “tightening the noose” around the port city, and that “fighting against nationalists” was taking place in the city centre. Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, appeared to confirm the claim. Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had “temporarily” lost access to the Azov Sea, which opens to the Black Sea and would be a major blow for Ukraine. More than 130 people have been rescued following a Russian airstrike on a Mariupol theatre that was sheltering hundreds of civilians. Speaking in the early hours of Saturday, Zelenskiy said there was no new information regarding fatalities. The city was experiencing “the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine”, he said. There were also reports on Friday of mass casualties after a missile attack on a Ukrainian army barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The Institute of the Study of War said Russian forces continued to secure territorial gains only around Mariupol on Friday and that Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems. Russian attempts to surround Kyiv and Mykolaiv have been pushed back, according to the UK, which said heavy Russian shelling of encircled cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol has continued. Six and a half million people are currently displaced within Ukraine, according to the UN. The World Food Programme has warned Ukraine’s food supply chains are breaking down, with many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. There have been 816 confirmed civilian deaths, according to the UN. Kyiv officials said 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. I’m now handing over to my colleague in London, Clea Skopeliti. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has said that Russian lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces was killed during fighting. The claim has not been verified. Ukraine has also said its anti-aircraft defences have hit 12 Russian targets: two planes, three helicopters, three drones and four cruise missiles. Russia has said it has used hypersonic weapons to destory an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Hypersonic missiles are fast weapons that can evade detection by missile defence systems. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday it had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. The ministry said it had also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port city of Odessa using a coastal missile system, according to Interfax, which was cited by a Reuters report. These claims have not been independently verified. The UK Ministry of Defence says the Kremlin has “so far failed to achieve its original objectives” and has been “surprised by the scale and ferocity of the Ukrainian resistance”. In its latest intelligence update, the UK MoD says Russia has been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition. “This is likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis,” it warns. According to the UN, 816 civilians are confirmed to have been killed since the conflict began, while 1,333 people have been wounded, mostly from explosive weapons. Kyiv officials said yesterday that 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. Serhiy Gaiday, governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, has said a humanitarian corridor for evacuation will be open on Saturday. He said a “regime of silence” has been agreed from 9am Kyiv time, according to Reuters. That’s about 40 minutes from now. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will push for a unified international response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when he meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday. Here is some further detail from Reuters: “Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine coincides with this trip, I’d like to emphasise the importance of international unity and confirm that Japan and India will work together on various issues,” Kishida said ahead of his visit. India and Japan are party to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a security framework that also includes the United States and Australia. Japan has imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian individuals and organisations since the Ukraine invasion that began on Feb. 24 and has been receiving Ukrainian refugees. India, however, is the only one of the four Quad members that has not condemned the invasion. Kishida will also aim to reinforce security and economic ties with India, the world’s second most populous country and Asia’s third-largest economy. At least 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed following a Russian air strike on an army barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv on Friday, according to local media reports cited by AFP. The mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Senkevich said on Facebook on Friday that several villages in the region had been occupied and the city had been under heavy fire, calling it a “difficult day”. In the early hours of Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy released a video address in which he told Moscow that now was the time for urgent peace talks, warning that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. Here are some of the key points from his speech: Russia has continued to block the supply of aid to besieged cities “in most areas” Zelenskiy said that on Friday there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six in the Sumy region, one in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol, he said, and hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But he added: “The occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an ‘argument’ for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime.” No new information on fatalities following a Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol Zelenskiy said people were being rescued from the rubble, and that more than 130 people had been rescued so far. “Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead,” he said. Hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the theatre. He thanked those defending Mariupol, saying the city was experiencing “the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine.” Russian forces had been stopped “in almost all directions” Zelenskiy said Russian forces were halted across many areas of the country. He said there was heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region, especially near Izyum, but that Russian troops were unprepared. “Meaningful, fair” negotiations were urgently needed Zelenskiy told Moscow: “It’s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia’s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.” He said: “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes.” On the international response Zelenskiy said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan. He has spoken with Ukrainian ambassadors around the world “to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods” for displaced people in Ukraine. A coordination headquarters has also been set up to oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he said. The Vatican has long played global mediator but has struggled to make its mark in the Ukraine conflict, reports AFP. It is walking a tightrope between the desire for peace and ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. Here is some analysis from AFP: The Argentine pontiff has been forced to perform a diplomatic balancing act. He has been drawn into the conflict as the spiritual guide of five to six million Catholics in Ukraine. But the Vatican has also spent years fostering closer ties with the Russian Orthodox Church led by Patriarch Kirill - a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a key pillar of his ruling apparatus. This led in 2016 to the historic meeting between Pope Francis and Kirill, the first encounter by the heads of the two churches since Christianity split into Western and Eastern branches in the 11th century. In December, the pontiff even raised the possibility of going to Moscow to meet with this “brother” Kirill in the near future. Francis “is inevitably considered as both judge and party” in the conflict, noted Bernard Lecomte, a specialist in the Vatican and eastern Europe. The result has been a series of public statements by the pope condemning the war in increasingly emotive terms - without ever mentioning Russia as the aggressor. Hello it’s Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you all the latest developments unfolding in Ukraine. It’s 7.20am in Ukraine. Here’s where things stand: US president, Joe Biden, warned China’s president, Xi Jinping, that there will be “implications and consequences” if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities, the White House said. Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack during the two hour call on Friday. In a video address Zelenskiy said “meaningful, fair” peace talks were needed urgently. He warned Moscow that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. On Friday, fighting reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water. The Russian defence ministry said its forces were “tightening the noose” around the port city, and that “fighting against nationalists” was taking place in the city centre. Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, appeared to confirm the claim. Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had “temporarily” lost access to the Azov Sea, which opens to the Black Sea and would be a major blow for Ukraine. More than 130 people have been rescued following a Russian airstrike on a Mariupol theatre that was sheltering hundreds of civilians. Speaking in the early hours of Saturday, Zelenskiy said there was no new information regarding fatalities. The city was experiencing “the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine”, he said. There were also reports of mass casualties after a missile attack on a Ukrainian army barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The Institute of the Study of War said Russian forces continued to secure territorial gains only around Mariupol on Friday and that Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems. Russian attempts to surround Kyiv and Mykolaiv have been pushed back, according to the UK, which said heavy Russian shelling of encircled cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol has continued. Six and a half million people are currently displaced within Ukraine, according to the UN. The World Food Programme has warned Ukraine’s food supply chains are breaking down, with many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. There have been 816 confirmed civilian deaths, according to the UN. Kyiv officials said 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. Russian forces are “holding captive” a Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. In a statement, Hromadske said they believe Roshchyna was detained by the Russian FSB around 15 March. Vladimir Putin praised Russian “unity” over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine during a rare public speech at the national stadium in Moscow. As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs. The Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a “technical failure” for the disruption. Zelenskiy said Ukraine expects progress on its EU membership bid within months, following a call with the head of EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen. He also said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/mar/10/us-saudi-arabia-trump-kushner-mohammed-bin-salman","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-10T10:00:40Z","webTitle":"The heart of the US-Saudi relationship lies in the Kushner-prince friendship | Mohamad Bazzi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/us-saudi-arabia-trump-kushner-mohammed-bin-salman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/us-saudi-arabia-trump-kushner-mohammed-bin-salman","fields":{"headline":"The heart of the US-Saudi relationship lies in the Kushner-prince friendship","bodyText":"The new Democratic majority in Congress is unraveling the many ways that Donald Trump’s administration has been beholden to Saudi Arabia since its earliest days. In a report last month that got lost in the crush of other news, House Democrats detailed how top Trump administration officials, including Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner, pushed to provide the Saudi government with technology to build nuclear power plants. That could put Saudi Arabia on the path to developing nuclear weapons, and further destabilize the Middle East. Kushner’s role is particularly troubling because, as the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, he has cultivated and shored up the relationship between Trump and the ruthless Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The Kushner-Prince Mohammed friendship is at the heart of the US-Saudi relationship today, and it’s one reason that Trump has tried to shield the crown prince from blame for the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump and Kushner, both used to shady real estate deals, adapted quickly to Saudi Arabia’s system of patronage and clientelism: unwavering support from the Trump administration for the promise of weapons sales and other business deals. The project to sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia began in late 2016, during the presidential transition, when a group of retired US generals and national security officials coalesced around Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser. Even after Flynn was fired in February 2017, other White House officials revived the plan, despite objections from administration lawyers who worried that the proposal could violate US laws intended to stop nuclear proliferation. And the idea is still alive: Trump met last month with the CEOs of several private nuclear power companies who sought his help in building power plants in the Middle East. While most attention has been focused on Flynn’s role, Kushner is entangled in several conflicts of interest around the Saudi project, according to the 24-page report from the House oversight and reform committee. One of the potential beneficiaries of a Saudi nuclear deal is Westinghouse Electric, which is owned by a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management, a real estate company that recently bailed out Kushner and his family’s company in their ill-fated, $1.8bn purchase of a Manhattan office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue. The alliance between Kushner and Prince Mohammed has consequences for US policy: Trump ignored a deadline last month to submit a report to Congress on whether the crown prince was personally responsible for Khashoggi’s murder and dismemberment at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, as US intelligence agencies concluded. But like Trump’s previous attempts to shield the prince from blame for Khashoggi’s killing, this one will backfire. By defending Prince Mohammed so strongly, Trump has made the crisis worse and has emboldened a tougher response in Congress. Soon after Trump was elected, the Saudi crown prince and his advisers targeted Kushner as their gateway into Trump’s inner circle. They realized that Kushner was vulnerable because of his business dealings, lack of knowledge of the Middle East and eagerness to negotiate a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump’s “inner circle is predominantly dealmakers who lack familiarity with political customs and deep institutions, and they support Jared Kushner”, a delegation of Saudi officials sent to the US by Prince Mohammed in November 2016 wrote in a presentation that was later published by the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar. The Saudis hooked Kushner on that visit, and by March 2017 he had arranged a formal lunch for Trump and Prince Mohammed at the White House, where the prince received a grand reception normally reserved for heads for state. Kushner then convinced Trump to make Saudi Arabia the first stop of his maiden foreign trip as president in May 2017. By that point, the Saudis realized that Trump craved flattery and respect, and they gave him an extravagant welcome with multiple banquets and displays of fealty. It’s no surprise that Prince Mohammed later boasted, according to the Intercept, that Kushner was “in his pocket” and had provided information about rivals in the Saudi royal family. Kushner has been particularly vulnerable because of his family’s purchase of the tower at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, at the height of the real estate market that crashed a year later. For the past two years, Kushner Companies has been negotiating for a bailout on the property with investors from China and Qatar, who had close ties to both governments. But those deals collapsed as investors worried about the extra scrutiny generated by Kushner’s role in the White House. Last spring, Kushner Companies reached a tentative deal with Brookfield Asset Management, which is one of the world’s largest real estate companies, for a 99-year lease on the troubled office tower. At the same time as Brookfield’s property arm was making its deal with the Kushners, another Brookfield unit announced its $4.6bn purchase of Westinghouse Electric, a bankrupt nuclear services company that was part of the consortium vying to build power plants in Saudi Arabia. That purchase needed the approval of the Trump administration: it was subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which includes senior officials from nine US government agencies. The deal required US approval because Canadian-based Brookfield is a foreign company that was seeking to buy an American firm in the nuclear industry. In the past, the committee required some foreign companies to abandon or make changes in their proposed deals. But Brookfield’s takeover of Westinghouse Electric was approved, and the deal closed on 1 August. On 3 August, Brookfield’s property unit announced it had closed its deal with Kushner Companies and that it would be paying the rent for the entire 99-year lease upfront: an infusion of about $1.1bn that would help the Kushners pay off a large portion of $1.4bn in mortgages due in February 2019. Without a deal, those looming mortgage payments could have forced the Kushners to sell the Fifth Avenue tower at a significant loss. It’s unclear if Kushner’s business interests played a role in the US approval of Brookfield’s acquisition of a nuclear company. But these conflicts underline the Trump administration’s entire approach to Saudi Arabia and its allies. With his blind support for the reckless crown prince, Trump has dropped the pretense that the US-Saudi alliance is more than a transactional arrangement based on oil, weapons deals and some perceived security interests. On 16 October, the same day that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, arrived in Riyadh to meet with the Saudi king and crown prince over Khashoggi’s fate, Saudi officials deposited $100m in funds that had been pledged to the Trump administration in August to help stabilize parts of Syria liberated from the Islamic State. American diplomats were unsure when the money would arrive until it suddenly appeared in US accounts. The timing of the funds was a signal to Trump in the deal-making language he understands: the kingdom would continue to honor its financial promises and business commitments to the United States if Trump cooperates in the crisis precipitated by Khashoggi’s murder. Saudi leaders conveyed to Trump – and Kushner – that they too value family loyalty and financial interests above all else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2020/apr/14/tuesday-briefing-a-long-way-to-go-in-lockdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-14T05:29:20Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: 'A long way to go' in lockdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/tuesday-briefing-a-long-way-to-go-in-lockdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/apr/14/tuesday-briefing-a-long-way-to-go-in-lockdown","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: 'A long way to go' in lockdown","bodyText":"Top story: Trump in White House tantrum Hello, Warren Murray here, pleased to be delivering the Briefing once again after our Easter hiatus. People in Britain have been warned that there is “a long way to go” before lockdown measures are likely to be relaxed, with the government and its chief scientific adviser suggesting they could last another month. Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the recovering PM, Boris Johnson, said it was “absolutely crucially important” not to let up at this point. The head of the World Health Organization has urged caution over moves to lift lockdown conditions, as the global number of infections approaches 2 million. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned the situation there is getting worse rather than better, while China says its neighbour has failed to control imported cases. “The Chinese people have watched Russia become a severely affected country,” said an editorial in China’s state press. To get you up to speed quickly here is our latest at-a-glance summary. Donald Trump has declared in a White House briefing that his “authority is total” when it comes to lockdown rules during the coronavirus pandemic. The president delivered a bizarre performance in which he played a campaign video produced by White House staff – in a possible violation of election laws – that consisted of Fox News clips praising his response. Trump’s assertion of sweeping powers over the states has been rejected by legal analysts as a gross misreading of the US constitution, which assures the states of autonomy. David Smith writes: “A toddler threw a self-pitying tantrum on live television on Monday night. Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world’s most powerful country.” The US is nearing the peak of its outbreak, according to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield: “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before. We are stabilising right now.” Our live coverage continues – read the latest here. There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Labour hit by report leak – Keir Starmer has ordered an urgent review into a leaked internal report on Labour antisemitism that concluded factional hostility to Jeremy Corbyn hampered efforts to tackle the problem. The conclusions clash with complaints of ex-Labour whistleblowers who said there was political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. Plans to submit the report to an Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry have been scrapped. The previous Labour leadership’s handling of antisemitism allegations overshadowed parts of the 2019 election campaign.Sienna Rodgers, editor of LabourList, writes that the leak inflames factional warfare just as Starmer seeks to unite the party. * * * Fires nearing Chernobyl – Wildfires in Ukraine have spread to just over a mile from the Chernobyl power plant, according to activists. Ukraine’s emergency services agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been sent in. A Chernobyl tour operator, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat: “The situation is critical. The zone is burning.” Ukraine’s emergency services said the fire was “difficult” but called for calm and urged people not to listen to “apocalyptic messages … The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone.” Chernobyl is the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. * * * ‘Need you in the White House’ – Bernie Sanders has endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president. Appearing with Biden in a live stream, the senator said: “We need you in the White House. We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.” Biden called Sanders “the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America … the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror. If I am the [Democratic] nominee – which it looks like now you just made me – I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern.” In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, Sanders will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates. The pair announced their staff had set up task forces to help find common policy ground. * * * Seat of his pants – A civilian passenger was launched out of the cockpit of a French fighter jet doing 500km/h after panicking and pulling the ejection lever, an investigation has found. The flight had official approval and was given to the defence company executive as a gift, but the 64-year-old was terribly nervous beforehand and pulled the lever while trying to steady himself during takeoff. He parachuted to the ground and sustained only minor injuries. The pilot was not ejected and managed to land the plane. Coronavirus Extra Governments in at least 25 countries are employing vast programmes for mobile data tracking, apps to record contact with others, CCTV equipped with facial recognition and drones to enforce social isolation regimes. The unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance has researchers and privacy advocates around the world worried that it may prove difficult to roll back. In our science podcast, Nicola Davis speaks to Dr Andy Whittamore about the effects of Covid-19 on people with asthma and what they can do to protect themselves. As of Monday in Greece there had been 2,145 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 99 deaths – far lower than elsewhere in Europe. This despite after almost a decade embroiled in a debt crisis from which the health system is by no means recovered. A rapid move to social distancing has helped, but still, the government is somewhat unexpectedly basking in the limelight of having flattened the curve, writes Helena Smith. Today in Focus podcast: Germany’s testing regime vs UK In February Germany and Britain were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus. But over the subsequent weeks they began to go in very different directions. Guardian health editor Sarah Boseley and Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann look at what happened next. Lunchtime read: Meltdown averted for now It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. The bits of the economy that do continue to function rely on credit to pay costs and wages. Meanwhile millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit too. What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. During major crises, we are reminded that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited – and the last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system by the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible. Sport Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have aimed stinging criticism at British Cycling, the sport’s national governing body, in a Q&amp;A session on Instagram. Cavendish hoped to compete in the Madison in Japan and win the Olympic gold medal that has eluded him but he was not selected. Wiggins’s verdict: “I think it’s shit, to be honest, but hey, cycling has changed so much.” County cricket’s defiantly low-key nature has brought joy to millions but may not save it in a looming era of belt-tightening, writes Jonathan Liew. “There were times during the gloriously sunny weekend when it was perhaps only natural to wonder how the opening day of the 2020 County Championship season was going … Instead: nothing. A whispering void.” Ewan Murray reports how Scottish football’s voting farce led to open warfare breaking out: the SPFL wanted clubs to end the season but Dundee’s missing vote has resulted in the game’s governing body being questioned. And from Vertonghen to Cavani, there are a lot of players in Europe who do not know if they will finish the season with their clubs.

Cut off their hands, make them pay and answer,” shouted an elderly woman in a black chador, suddenly standing up at a conservative election rally in south Tehran. Mohammad Hosseini, Iran’s minister for culture and Islamic guidance from 2009 to 2013 under the then president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, replied. If elected, he said, he would always be available to his people. He even read out his phone number to the crowd to underline his sincerity. Popular anger at corruption, the slide in living standards and the political mistakes of the reformist government of President Hassan Rouhani is widespread in Iran, and fuels the conservatives’ call for “a strong parliament” to be elected this Friday in nationwide elections. If the conservatives can take power, and appoint someone such as the former Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf as speaker, Rouhani can be kept on a tight leash in his final year of office before fresh presidential elections. The deeper question is whether the disillusionment about Rouhani masks a deeper fatalism and disenchantment with all formal politics in Iran. Despite a Motown-style singing quartet, occasional chants of “death to America and death to Israel”, the crowd at Hosseini’s election meeting, divided by gender and leaning towards the age of 60 rather than 16, did not look that animated. The modern cinema hall was only half full on a Monday afternoon, and even the offer of delicious cream doughnuts had not lured that many from a working-class district of Tehran. At the close of the two-hour event, a hundred or so gathered on stage to wave small Iranian flags and confirm it was their patriotic duty to vote. Hosseini argued “we need a strong parliament to hold Rouhani to account”. At times the speakers were close to beseeching the audience to each bring a further 100 people to the polling booths this week. The tone reflected the conservatives’ great fear in these elections – that they will win with what one senior Iranian diplomatic official privately predicted would be a landslide, but the success will be soured by mass abstention. If turnout is low, the conservatives will regain the parliament since its base will come out to vote, but if it is too low the result could be taken as a vote of no confidence in the whole Islamic Republic. One survey shows 75% do not plan to vote, and in the elegant squares of the University of Tehran, small groups gathered calling for a boycott, holding placards saying: “The people are fighting poverty, the regime is looking for votes.” One reformist candidate, Vahid Tootoonch, said “it is a freezing cold atmosphere in Tehran towards the elections”, and that at best he hoped for a vote around the 40% mark. Yet predictions in such a complex, multi-layered society as Iran are foolish, especially since it has been through some of the most turbulent months in its 41-year history. Hundreds were killed in riots caused by “shock therapy” fuel price rises in November. The government declined this week to give an official figure on the deaths. Then Donald Trump’s assassination of the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force Qassem Suleimani – his picture adorns every highway in Tehran – reunited the country, only for Iranian military reprisals, leading to the mistaken downing of a Ukrainian civilian jet, reignited society’s divisions. One disillusioned reformist activist said: “The regime’s cover-up over the jet was the last straw for me. Iran’s politics is a game. If the roots of a tree are poisoned, it does not matter how you decorate the leaves. I am done with it.” Meanwhile the pressure on the economy, due to American sanctions as well as corruption, is relentless. On Tuesday morning around Ferdowsi Square in Tehran the hundreds of currency exchange markets, which have proliferated since sanctions were imposed, bustled with customers. Overnight, the markets had pushed the value of the dollar up a further 10%, amid concern that Iran is set to be blacklisted again by the international Financial Action Task Force after failing to comply with a final warning to sign up to its money-laundering and anti-terror laws. Blacklisting would cut Iranian banks off further from the world financial system. Abdolnaser Hemmati, the governor of the Iranian Central Bank, insisted the risk of being blacklisted was low, but the steady flow of taxis turning up to the exchange markets showed many were unconvinced. At times $10,000 in cash were being bought and sold. The siege backdrop could not make for a greater contrast than the last parliamentary elections five years ago when Rouhani’s reformists, promising to take the country out of economic isolation, became the largest party, winning all 30 seats in Tehran. Then the possibility of change gripped the capital. Now, at a thinly attended meeting for a reformist faction linked to the former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, held in a backroom, the panel were peppered with questions about their record and whether their support for the nuclear deal had been mistaken. Tootoonch doggedly defended the deal, saying it was a model for showing negotiations can have results, but he said no one could have foreseen that Donald Trump would be elected US president or Iran’s conservatives would resist the deal as much as they did. By contrast, Mohammad Sadegh Kooshki, a hardline academic at Tehran University, said he had always predicted the nuclear deal would not bear fruit. “We never held a tool to force the Americans to hold to their commitments. The Americans had a tool in sanctions. We did not, and as a result we have lost six years developing our nuclear power plants.” The truth was that neither the US nor Europe dared allow a truly powerful independent industrial country to be formed in the Middle East’s heartland, he said. “The Americans want us to be oil salesmen, just buying goods from them like the Saudis, and Emiratis. Big powers don’t want to have rivals,” he said. He favoured building relations with China or Russia. At the barracks-like and conservative Shahed University on the south side of Tehran, Dr Hamidreza Sayyedi was equally insistent Iran would survive. He said the religious nature of the regime was fundamental to its sustainability: “If England had suffered 1% of the level of sanctions that we have suffered, the country would have collapsed. We can endure.” The Islamic Republic was not some medieval merger of church and state, but a newer, higher form of governance, he said. But the question then arises that if the conservatives are so confident the tide is with them, why had the 12-strong Guardian Council composed of clerics and jurists largely appointed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned so many reformists from standing in the elections? More than half the 14,000 applications to stand have been rejected for various reasons, such as a lack of true Islamic faith, or good health. But it is not the mass nature of the disqualifications that matter, but their targeted nature. Credible figures such as Ali Motahari, Mahmoud Sadeghi, and Shahindokht Molaverdi, all critics of various forms of state repression, have found themselves debarred. Even Rouhani complained in public and private that elections without contests were appointments, not democracy. The political engineering has meant the reformist umbrella group decided not to put forward a unified list for the 30 seats reserved for Tehran in the 290-strong parliament. But it left others to decide if they wished to put up lists, and did not advocate a boycott, a halfway house that dissatisfied some. The heavy-handedness of the intervention suggests Khamenei sees the reformists’ disarray as a chance to consolidate his power ahead of the presidential election next year, and even prepare his succession. At an hour-long press conference on Wednesday a spokesman for the Guardian Council repeatedly denied claims he had rigged the elections, saying the candidate qualifications decisions were based on the law, asserting the Council was “not a political club”. He said turnout in elections in Iran had never fallen below 50%, but if it did that was no problem, pointing that the figure was similar to some French elections. Mohsen Aref, a one-time campaigner for Rouhani at Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran, argues Rouhani’s failure has revealed the impossibility of reforming the regime. He said Tehran only revealed its truths slowly, and the real truth is that most Iranians are not religious hardliners, but highly educated people with a rich culture. “We want to engage with the world. Iran started as a totalitarian majority regime. It is now a totalitarian minority regime.” Turnout, as much as the result, will help reveal if he is right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2019/aug/27/hinkley-suicide-alarm-family-of-victim-calls-for-more-support-for-lonely-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-27T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Hinkley suicide alarm: family of victim calls for more support for lonely workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/27/hinkley-suicide-alarm-family-of-victim-calls-for-more-support-for-lonely-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2019/aug/27/hinkley-suicide-alarm-family-of-victim-calls-for-more-support-for-lonely-workers","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley suicide alarm: family of victim calls for more support for lonely workers","bodyText":"The family of a man who took his own life while working as a coach driver ferrying workers to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant site has called for more support for thousands of workers living far from home on such projects. Kevin Ward, 57, was found hanged in a caravan on a camping site close to the power station project on the Somerset coast, where he lived alone. His family said he found it difficult to find the time to make it back to Essex, where his two children and four grandchildren live. The Guardian has recently highlighted deep concerns about the mental health of people working at major building projects such as Hinkley Point. Union leaders say there has been a surge this year in suicide attempts among the 4,000-plus workers at the site, Britain’s largest construction project since the second world war. EDF, the French company leading the project, says a range of measures have been introduced to improve the mental health of its staff. Multiple factors are believed to make construction industry workers more vulnerable to mental illness, including bullying, financial insecurity and the loneliness of spending long periods away from home. Ward worked for Somerset Passenger Solutions (SPS), a company set up to transport workers to and from Hinkley Point. His daughter, Frankie Ward, from Grays in Essex, said she felt that not enough had been done to help her father. “He was under a lot of stress and pressure from work and his home life wasn’t great,” she said. “He was miles away from his family and friends. He never really got to see his family much as we’re all in Essex and he was in Somerset. It was always difficult to see him as we all work, and we mostly had to try and work around Dad’s holiday requests.” Ward, from Epping in Essex, had been a black-cab driver for more than 20 years but moved to Somerset with a partner when the taxi work began to fizzle out. He found a job as a lorry driver before getting a job with SPS. His relationship broke up and he suffered ill health. His family accept that a number of factors may have been at play when he took his own life. But they believe he was deeply unhappy at work and because he was so far from his Essex roots. Frankie Ward said: “We went to see him for Christmas. He looked lost, like a little boy, I felt bad leaving him. His rest days were all over the place. That meant he could not get back to us. He was on his own in the caravan that he had been staying in for the past month. He used to joke that it was just him and the sheep. “I spoke to him the night before he did what he did. He seemed extremely low. He had always been a fun, loving, spontaneous man, he was a very likeable person. Family was everything to him. He used to be the happiest person in the world. “It was so sad that he had fallen so far. He had no interest in anything. I think the company could have done more to help. There should be more support for people in his situation.” Ward was found dead on 25 July last year. At his funeral service his daughter read out a poem to him: “I will never get over the fact you are no longer here, I feel like I’m living in fear.” A spokesperson for SPS said it was unable to comment on an individual case but said it had a range of measures in place to support employees. The spokesperson said: “For example, we have a number of specially trained mental health first aiders to support people in times of need and to encourage an open and supportive working environment. “The wellbeing support programme at Hinkley Point C assists SPS and other contractors in helping individuals in need and also in highlighting the importance of good mental health for everyone. SPS is increasing the number of trained staff able to provide this support to their colleagues.” The company said all employees had access to the medical centre at Hinkley Point. “This service is available for managers to refer colleagues where necessary and also for anyone where no referral is required to discuss health matters in confidence,” the spokesperson said.

Have a good evening and thanks for reading. Boris Johnson for the first time committed to an “independent inquiry” into the coronavirus pandemic. The prime minister said it was not right to devote “huge amounts of official time” to an inquiry when the UK was “in the middle” of a pandemic. However, in response to a question from the acting Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, he said there would “certainly” be in inquiry “in the future”. Johnson indicated that he had not read a government-commissioned report setting out urgent measures needed to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, telling the Commons only that he was “aware” of it. Johnson was questioned at length by Keir Starmer about the study by 37 senior doctors and scientists, published this week, and the need for an effective test-and-trace system to mitigate any new outbreak. The prime minister claimed the government’s test-and-trace system was “as good as or better than anywhere else in the world” – a claim Downing Street later failed to substantiate with evidence. The claim was made during a testy PMQs in which Johnson accused Starmer of “knocking the confidence” of the British people. A further 85 people in the UK have died of coronavirus in the latest 24-hour period, according to government figures. It takes the official death toll to 45,053, although the true figure is much higher when including excess deaths. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has said she was “deeply unhappy” with the much-criticised Public Health England report last month that failed to explain the reasons why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, described as “frankly ridiculous” the government’s insistence that face coverings do not need to be worn in takeaway shops – after Michael Gove was photographed leaving a Pret a Manger without wearing one on the day the government announced that face coverings would be mandatory in England’s shops from 24 July. Khan urged people to wear a face covering in all shops and takeaways: Stormont’s health minister, Robin Swann, will recommend to the Northern Ireland executive that the wearing of face coverings in shops in the region becomes mandatory. Swann said “everything possible must be done” to encourage the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor spaces. Chris Grayling, the former minister who is no stranger to career mishaps, has failed in his bid to become chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee. He had been widely expected to be elected to the post. Pubs in Ireland that do not serve food are set to remain closed until 10 August. Currently only bars that provide a substantial meal are allowed to sell alcohol. A week after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced VAT cuts on food and drink in the hospitality sector, some well-known names have set out how they will reflect the changes. McDonald’s, Nando’s, Pret a Manger and Starbucks are among the brands promising price reductions on their menus, my colleague Rebecca Smithers reports. While for some this will mean only result in a 50p discount on some foods – a Nando’s quarter chicken, for example, will now cost £3.70 instead of £4.25 – it amounts to a saving of more than £5 on a £45 family meal out, according to Deloitte. As the famous Tesco slogan goes, every little helps. Pubs in Ireland that do not serve food are set to remain closed until 10 August, PA Media reports. Currently only bars that provide a substantial meal are allowed to sell alcohol. Ministers are expected to delay plans to fully reopen the industry from next week over concerns about the number of young people who have contracted Covid-19. Face coverings are also set to be made mandatory in shops following Wednesday evening’s cabinet meeting. Here’s my colleague Dan Sabbagh’s story on Chris Grayling failing to become the intelligence committee chair - to the surprise, it seems, of almost everyone in Westminster. One source said Grayling “didn’t see it coming”. The nine members of the MPs’ committee voted five to four in favour of Tory MP Julian Lewis: This from Tom Newton Dunn, of Times Radio, on Grayling’s stumble at the finishing line: Chris Grayling, the former minister who is no stranger to career mishaps, has failed in his bid to become chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee – having been widely expected to be elected to the post. The ex-transport secretary was Boris Johnson’s pick for the chairmanship of the influential committee, which scrutinises the work of the UK’s intelligence agencies, and was thought to be a shoo-in for the job. But it was not to be. The Tory MP Julian Lewis, a former chair of the defence select committee, has been appointed instead. Westminster scribes are hammering the phones to find out what went wrong for Grayling. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has said she was “deeply unhappy” with the much-criticised Public Health England report last month that failed to explain the reasons why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. Her frank admission came at the tail end of a hearing of the Commons women and equalities committee, when she was asked whether the data collected on the the impact of coronavirus on BAME communities was good enough. (You can watch it back here.) She replied: Certainly, I was deeply unhappy with the PHE report that we commissioned because what I was expecting was the information around co-morbidities and other factors, occupational information for example. So from the perspective of the equalities minister after waiting six weeks to then have that report which, while helpful in confirming what we knew rather than it being anecdotal, did not actually explain the why, which is the work that I’m taking forward. So from that perspective, no [the data is not good enough], because if it was then I wouldn’t have to be doing the work that I am doing. I was very unhappy with that. But as the minister, the responsibility at the end of it lies with me, so that’s why I’m very focused on getting the data rather than just complaining that it’s not there. Some breaking news from Westminster: Labour is poised to make a formal apology to antisemitism whistleblowers as part of a settlement designed to draw a line under allegations made during the Jeremy Corbyn era. The whistleblowers sued the party for defamation in the wake of a BBC Panorama investigation last year. No final settlement has been reached but sources said an agreement was imminent. My colleagues Jessica Elgot, Heather Stewart and Lisa O’Carroll have the full story: Earlier today Downing Street said there would be an exemption on mask use for takeaway purchases, following pictures yesterday of Michael Gove leaving Pret a Manger without a face covering. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the government’s approach was “frankly ridiculous” and urged people to wear a face covering in all shops and takeaways: On this week’s Politics Weekly podcast, Heather Stewart and Polly Toynbee discuss the latest news from Westminster. Dan Sabbagh breaks down yesterday’s Huawei decision and why it spells trouble for the Tories. Plus, Rajeev Syal talks to Vaughan Gething about the Covid-19 response in Wales and Welsh independence. You can listen here: A further 85 people in the UK have died of coronavirus in the latest 24-hour period, according to government figures. It takes the official death toll to 45,053, although the true figure is much higher when including excess deaths. Stormont’s health minister, Robin Swann, will recommend to the Northern Ireland executive that the wearing of face coverings in shops in the region becomes mandatory. According to PA Media, Swann said he did not want to pre-empt decisions by the country’s executive but that “everything possible must be done” to encourage the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor spaces. He added: The chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser agree. It is also the case that making it mandatory would provide clarity and reassurance for members of the public. We need to promote every available measure to stop the spread of Covid-19, both now and into the autumn and winter, given the risk of further waves of infection. Wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces will have to become second nature if we are to keep each other safe. Swann said making the wearing of face coverings mandatory would also “show solidarity” with those who are due to come out of shielding from 31 July. This from Sky News reporter Inzamam Rashid on the Public Health England report on why black, Asian and minority ethnic people (BAME) are disproportionately contracting and dying from Covid-19: Well, well, well. Rishi Sunak’s team (it must have been his advisers, as the man himself is currently being quizzed by MPs) has tweeted a picture of the chancellor leaving a Pret a Manger wearing a snazzy-looking face mask. Only yesterday, Sunak’s government colleague Michael Gove was photographed leaving a Pret without wearing a face covering, prompting some opprobrium following his stance on Sunday that it was not necessary to make such masks mandatory in England’s shops. The government announced yesterday that it would be mandatory for people to wear face coverings in England’s shops from 24 July, following the same move in Scotland. Greater Manchester has announced plans to hold an online interfaith memorial service for all those who have died from coronavirus. Rogers Govender, the dean of Manchester, will tomorrow lead a socially distanced service at Manchester Cathedral which will be streamed on its Facebook page. There will be no choir or singing, in line with current restrictions. An online book of remembrance will also be launched as a permanent tribute to those who have died in Greater Manchester. If you want to follow Rishi Sunak’s appearance before the Treasury committee, you can head to my colleague Graeme Wearden’s business liveblog. As I said, I’ll have any breaking news lines here. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing the Treasury committee. I’ll cover any breaking news but will keep this blog focused on coronavirus. For what it’s worth, Sunak played the opening exchanges with a very straight bat, refusing to comment on any “future fiscal policy” such as tax rises. MPs will have difficulty learning anything substantially new from the chancellor this afternoon. Downing Street was unable to provide any evidence to back up Boris Johnson’s claim (see 12.12pm) that the test-and-trace service is “as good as or better than” any other system in the world, PA Media reports. When pressed, the prime minister’s official spokesman instead said: “We’ve talked in recent weeks about the number of people who test and trace have been identifying. “As of last Thursday, it had reached more than 144,000 close contacts of people who tested positive for coronavirus who might have otherwise unknowingly have spread the virus.” The Welsh government has said it fast-tracked more than 50 new laws to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Measures ranged from introducing the lockdown restrictions to changes to the planning system to enable field hospitals to be quickly built. At its daily press conference, the government announced changes to its coronavirus testing regime. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said care home staff would be offered weekly tests for the next four weeks - as they are now – but this would then drop to fortnightly tests. He said that where care homes were identified as higher risk, for example due to local outbreaks, “bespoke testing regimes” would be implemented. I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news if you’re heading to Magaluf. Authorities are closing the the party strip of Punta Ballena after footage (below) of drunken British tourists flouting coronavirus regulations while dancing on cars prompted an outcry. The Mirror has the story. My colleague Peter Walker has this post-PMQs story on Boris Johnson indicating he has not read a government-commissioned report setting out urgent measures needed to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus. Read the full story here: Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative MP and chair of the liaison committee, said the UK should never have allowed China to have a role in building nuclear power stations. Following the government’s decision to ban Huawei from the UK’s 5G network over security concerns, Jenkin said China should also not be allowed to “take control of other critical national infrastructure like nuclear power”. He has submitted a paper to the government – which he said had received “more smiles than grimaces” – calling for a British company to take control of plans for the Bradwell power station in Essex. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: I was absolutely aghast when a Chinese reactor design, controlled and operated by the Chinese, was proposed for Bradwell. The whole ‘golden age’ policy I was always opposed to. What this is about is a complete strategic blindness about the nature of the Chinese regime, its long-term strategy where we seem to have no strategy, no statecraft involved in this. Nicola Sturgeon has set out new plans for surveillance of coronavirus, as she confirmed there had been no further deaths of people testing positive for the virus for the seventh day running. Data from the National Records of Scotland indicated that this is the 11th week in a row that the number of deaths where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate has fallen. The Scottish government has published a paper setting out its latest approach to surveillance of the virus and the management of outbreaks. Sturgeon said: As we all go out and about more it becomes increasingly important that we are very alert, hyper-vigilant, to any early warnings that case numbers might be starting to increase again. She said responding quickly when cases arise was important, and the test-and-protect system was “absolutely vital”, but added that other sources of information were being used for early warnings, including NHS 24 call data and Covid-19 genome sequencing. Health Protection Scotland has updated its guidance on the management of public health incidents to allow for a rapid response to outbreaks. Captain Sir Tom Moore has said being knighted by the Queen in his own personal open-air ceremony will be “the most special of days for me”. The 100-year-old second world war veteran will travel to Windsor Castle on Friday with members of his family for the unprecedented investiture. He raised almost £33m for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden, and won the hearts of the nation for his determination, after originally setting out to raise just £1,000. In a message on his official Twitter account, Moore said: “I could never have imagined this would happen to me. It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty the Queen. It is going to be the most special of days for me.” Here is some reaction from Westminster journalists to that episode of PMQs. Our Peter Walker says Labour have a fruitful line of attack in exposing Johnson’s “lack of attention to detail”. The Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar says Johnson’s Calvin Kleins gag, which came in response to a question from Starmer about meeting families whose relatives had died from coronavirus, was “misjudged”. Francis Elliott, political editor of the Times, highlights the significance of Johnson committing to an independent inquiry into the UK’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic: The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been told it is “troubling” that she is unable to provide an assessment of the number of travellers entering the UK with coronavirus as quarantine measures are eased. Appearing before the home affairs select committee, Patel said the advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) continued to suggest that the number of cases brought in from overseas was about 0.5% of all cases in the UK. But under repeated questioning from Yvette Cooper, the chair of the committee, Patel, along with chief civil servants Matthew Rycroft and Shona Dunn, was unable to provide a figure for the number entering the country with the virus. The home secretary revealed there were now around 50,000 people coming into the country across all modes of transport. This is up from about 9,000 to 10,000 in April. Cooper told the home secretary: It’s quite troubling that none of you seem able to explain just an assessment of the number of people likely to be coming into the country with coronavirus or a proportion of the 50,000. The efficacy of the 0.5% measure has been challenged by the committee in the past and its members have repeatedly asked for an estimate of the number who entered the UK with the virus. Estimates suggest between 1,300 and 10,000 were brought into the country before 23 March, predominantly from Spain and Italy. Cooper questioned how the 0.5% figure had not changed since 23 March, when it was the same level. Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, said: “The home sec has asked and received updated estimates of the proportion in the UK that come in from overseas, that number continues to be up to 0.5%. It happens to be the same upper limit as the number from 23 March but it is refreshed advice from Sage.” Patel was unable to say how many individuals were in forced quarantine after entering the country from overseas but said between 6 June and 12 July there were 383,000 spot checks to assess compliance. The majority of checks, however, were completed at the border. Dunn, the second permanent secretary, said about 20% of the checks were in the community. Cooper said that in Spain cases are rising, and asked Patel what the threshold would be for placing Spain back on the quarantine list, meaning arrivals from Spain would have to self-isolate for 14 days. Patel said she was not involved in the process and deferred to other departments including the Department of Health and Social Care. That’s the end of this week’s PMQs. Helen Hayes (Lab) says the scourge of knife crime is continuing. Will the prime minister implement a cross-government approach to tackling serious violence? Johnson says he has sympathy with the families of all victims of knife crime. He says there should be a cross-departmental medical approach focused on the needs of the bereaved, but also a “tough policing solution”. In London, we have not seen the approach we saw under the previous mayor (himself), Johnson says, adding that there should be zero-tolerance on knife carrying. John Stevenson (Con) asks Johnson to support with financial backing the building of nuclear power-generating facilities in Cumbria. Johnson says Cumbria should continue its tradition as a pioneer of nuclear technologies. Hannah Bardell (SNP) asks the prime minister to commit to implementing all the recommendations in a recent report on vaginal mesh implants. Johnson says he’s had direct representations on this issue and that this government takes it extremely seriously. He or the department of health will meet with campaigners, he says. Graham Brady (Con) says some people are anxious to return to work in the office but some are not. Will Johnson be revising blanket government advice that recommends all but essential workers work from home, Brady asks? Johnson says employers should decide along with workers whether it is safe for employees to go into work or work from home. Kirsten Oswald (SNP) asks Johnson to raise awareness of childhood brain stem cancers following the suffering of one of her constituents. Johnson says he will do everything he can and ensure that Oswald can make submissions to the Department of Health and Social Care. Heather Wheeler (Con) asks the prime minister to acknowledge the importance of hybrid vehicles. Johnson says they’re an important part of the government’s transition to zero-emission vehicles. Tracy Brabin (Lab) says businesses and local authorities face costs from local lockdowns. Can we have daily postcode data, and a package of support for firms that have to close for extended periods? Johnson says ministers are committed to sharing “as much data as we have” with local authorities. Katherine Fletcher (Con) asks the prime minister to confirm that the government is “throwing the kitchen sink” at tackling Covid-19. Yes indeed, says Johnson. “Not only the kitchen sink – but every part of the kitchen,” he adds. “We’re going to build, build, build our way forward ... and do everything we can to get jobs, jobs, jobs.” Naz Shah (Lab) says councils are facing a £10bn blackhole and are already making redundancies. Will the prime minister provide more support and not embark on another era of austerity? Johnson says it has given £4.2bn in support for councils across the country and he pays tribute to their work during the pandemic. Jack Lopresti (Con) asks about aviation jobs. When will the prime minister announce a support package for the aviation industry? Johnson says the government is putting £3.9bn into aerospace technology enterprises. Darren Jones (Lab) asks the prime minister whether the government will penalise businesses for “doing the right thing” and closing during local lockdowns. Johnson says it has given support to firms across the country, including £20m in grants to Leicester. The best thing for everyone to do is work hard to bring the virus down, he adds. Craig Mackinlay (Con) asks the prime minister to find £17m to complete the regeneration of Thanet and east Kent. Johnson says it will be assessed in the third round of the new stations fund. Chris Law (SNP) asks the prime minister to sign off on the the Tay Cities Deal because 6,000 jobs hang in the balance. Johnson says he will write to Law about it. Robert Courts (Con) asks the prime minister to think about how the country should recognise Group Captain John Hemingway, who he says is the last surviving RAF pilot who fought in the Battle of Britain. Johnson says he will give it thought and suggests Courts raise it with parliamentary committees. Paul Blomfield (Lab) asks whether Johnson will commit to paying NHS workers more. Johnson says the government has given £3.2bn to local authorities to fight infection, introduced a living wage and “increased it by the biggest ever amount”. Darren Henry (Con) asks what steps the government is taking to help people with mental health conditions during the pandemic. Johnson says funding for mental health care has been massively increased to £12.5bn and it is publishing a national strategy for disabled people. Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, says the UK has one of the worst death rates in the world and Europe’s worst death rate for health and care workers. Will the PM commit in future to a public inquiry? Johnson says he does not believe that now is the right moment to devote time to an official inquiry “but of course we will seek to learn the lessons” and there will be an independent inquiry. Sarah Atherton MP (Con) asks the prime minister whether he will help a constituent who has to fly abroad for treatment. Johnson says he will look at it. The government is undertaking a full-scale assault on devolution, Blackford says. It is no wonder Nicola Sturgeon’s approval ratings are three times higher than the prime minister’s, he adds. Will the PM guarantee that Scotland will have the chance to choose its own future? Johnson repeats his line about the SNP wanting to hand powers to Brussels. He says there was a Scottish independence referendum in 2014 and the people voted in the majority to remain in the UK. Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the SNP, says tomorrow the government will publish legislation for “its biggest power grab” since 1997. The decisions of the Scottish parliament must and will be decided by the Scottish people, he says. Will the PM confirm that his government are ignoring the wishes of the Scottish people and “launching their hostile agenda against devolution”? Johnson says Blackford should be celebrating the 70 or so powers that will be transferred to the Scottish parliament. He says what Blackford wants to do is hand powers to Brussels, which “is neither elected or accountable”. Rob Butler (Con) asks for assurance that the government will safeguard animal welfare and high food standards. Johnson says he will give that assurance. Johnson goes on the attack, saying Starmer needs to decide whether he is going to support the government and what brief he is taking today – a reference to Starmer’s legal hinterland. “Because at the minute he’s got more briefs than Calvin Klein,” the prime minister says, to some cheers in the chamber. Starmer says it is perfectly possible to support test and trace while pointing out problems. Starmer says he is meeting the bereaved families of Covid-19 victims this afternoon and asks what the prime minister would like to say to them. Johnson says he mourns the loss of everyone who has died in this epidemic. The government will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent a second spike, he adds. Starmer says the number of people contacted by test and trace has fallen every week. He asks: has the prime minister actually read the Academy of Medical Sciences report that sets out the reasonable worst-case estimate for a second spike of Covid-19? Johnson says he is “of course aware of the report” and we’re taking every reasonable step to protect the economy from a second spike. The prime minister says Starmer has previously supported the government’s plan and tells him he needs to build up the confidence of the people “instead of endlessly knocking [their] confidence”. Starmer says he is surprised Johnson has not committed to fully implementing the recommendations in the Academy of Medical Sciences report. It is vital the government learns lessons, he says, adding that testing and tracing capacity will need to be significantly expanded to cope with the risks of autumn and winter. What assurances can the PM give that test and trace will be fit for purpose by this winter? Johnson says test and trace is working at “unprecedented scale” and 144,000 people had agreed to self-isolate. Seventy or eighty per cent of contacts are found, he says, adding: Our test-and-trace system is as good as or better than anywhere else in the world. (The fact-checkers may want to scrutinise that claim.) (Post amended as earlier version said Starmer was referring to an Office for Budget Responsibility report.) Starmer says Johnson should “call out” BA’s rehiring of 30,000 people on worse terms. He then moves on to the record Academy of Medical Sciences report which recommended that July and August must be a period of “intense preparation” to prevent a second spike of Covid-19. Will the PM implement those actions in full? Johnson said the government is getting on with preparing for a second spike and with record investment in the economy. He says it was thanks to the hard work of the NHS that they were able to prevent the health service being overwhelmed, and that the government will take steps so it isn’t overwhelmed in the coming months. (Amended as earlier post said Starmer was referring to an Office for Budget Responsibility report.) Starmer accuses Johnson of “rhetorical nonsense” and says it is perfectly right that the opposition point out problems with the government’s economic response. On British Airways, Starmer says the company is trying to force through the hiring of 30,000 employees on worse terms. Will the PM personally intervene and make clear actions like those at BA will not be allowed to stand? Johnson says the government has been clear that companies should support their workers and keep them in employment where they can. He says BA and other companies are in severe difficulties and “we cannot simply with a magic wand” ensure that every single job is saved. Keir Starmer asks about the government’s decision not to provide support to those whose jobs are most at risk, such as aviation. The prime minister says Labour supported many of the economic actions the government took last week and that aviation was an important industry. He says Starmer has to work out whether he’s going to support or oppose the government’s programme to get people back to work. Mark Menzies MP (Con) asks the prime minister to help secure key defence jobs in his Fylde constituency. Boris Johnson says he’s looking forward to the visit. Prime minister’s questions is starting soon. Here is the call list showing which MPs will be asking questions. The rate of coronavirus infection in England was significantly reduced in the month before lockdown restrictions were lifted, a study has found. According to the research from Imperial College London, the rate of infection throughout the country was halving every eight to nine days during May, PA Media reports. There were on average 13 positive cases for every 10,000 people, with an overall reproduction number of 0.57 – lower than previously reported. For the study, researchers tested more than 120,000 volunteers aged over five across the country for Covid-19. About 69% of those who tested positive reported no symptoms on the day of the test or the previous week, though they may have developed symptoms later. There may be positive news on the way from the world-leading Oxford University trial developing a vaccine against Covid-19. According to ITV’s Robert Peston, the first data from the trial is due to be published in the Lancet, possibly tomorrow, and will show that the vaccine is developing a positive antibody and T-cell response. Why are T-cells important? Well, they are a major component of the immune system and there is a growing body of evidence that an effective Covid-19 vaccine will need to trigger T-cells as well as antibodies. According to Peston, few of the vaccines under development around the world increase both antibodies and T-cells. But the Oxford vaccine “looks as though it has this twin effect”, he writes. He quotes a source as saying: An important point to keep in mind is that there are two dimensions to the immune response: antibodies and T-cells. Everybody is focussed on antibodies but there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the T-cells response is important in the defence against coronavirus. Good morning all. It’s Josh Halliday here, taking over from Caroline for the rest of the day. A busy afternoon ahead: in an hour we’ve got prime minister’s questions, where Boris Johnson is likely to get a tough time on face coverings. Then at 2.30pm, Rishi Sunak will face his first Commons committee session since his £30bn mini-budget last week. He’ll be pressed for more detail on how the government will pay for the borrowing funding the mega-spending on coronavirus. That’s all from me Caroline Davies. Thank you for your time. Jet2.com has restarted its flights and holidays programme after suspending its operations for nearly four months. Almost 50 flights are due to depart on Wednesday across seven airports in England and Scotland to destinations where travel restrictions have been eased, such as the Canaries, Balearics, mainland Spain, Turkey, Greece and Italy. The airports served are Manchester, Birmingham, East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Glasgow, Newcastle, and London Stansted. Tui restarted its holidays for UK customers on Saturday, while easyJet holidays will resume on 1 August. Marcus Rashford will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester for his “remarkable campaign against child poverty” which caused a government U-turn and the granting of free food vouchers for the poorest families over the summer. Boris Johnson had initially rejected the Manchester United striker’s move before reversing his decision last month. In lockdown the government provided vouchers to families whose children qualified for free school meals, but initially said it would not continue after term time.

The party says it is the first time the question of independence has been the sole focus of a debate in the Senedd. Last month a poll found that a quarter of people in Wales supported independence – the largest proportion recorded in an opinion survey. Speaking ahead of the debate, the Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, said: Wales has proven itself during the coronavirus crisis by acting independently to protect our citizens from the dysfunctionality and ineptitude of the Westminster government. As we come out of this crisis, we cannot go back to the status quo. The status quo has failed Wales. Underinvestment and unfair funding forms the crux of this unequal union of broken promises – delivered by the Tories at Westminster and defended by Labour through their support for the stagnant status quo. We are calling on the Welsh government to seek the constitutional right to allow the Senedd to legislate during the next term to hold a binding referendum on independence. The Labour-led government has said the people of Wales will get the chance to vote for change at next year’s Welsh parliament elections. It says Wales is better served by staying in the UK. Back on the question of masks, Matt Hancock has said face coverings will have to be worn in shops in England for the “foreseeable future”. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast: People will have to wear masks in shops and on public transport and in the NHS for the foreseeable future. The virus exists only to multiply and, without any measures, we know that each person infects another two to three people so we do have to have these measures in place, even though the number of cases are really low, to keep a grip on the virus.” Explaining the thinking behind not making face coverings mandatory in offices, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: That isn’t going to happen and the reason is in offices you tend to spend a lot of time with the same people. Where the mask benefits is from you spreading the disease to other people when you have relatively short interactions with lots of different people. Blackburn is facing a “rising tide” of coronavirus cases, centred on its large Asian community, with two weeks to get the numbers down before lockdown measures are reversed, the area’s public health director warned. The Lancashire town brought in extra restrictions on Tuesday and Prof Dominic Harrison, the local authority’s director of public health, said the borough of 148,000 people was facing a “rising tide” of cases. Harrison, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: We have what we call a rising tide event rather than an outbreak, and by that we mean that we’ve got a number of cases rising in specific areas across a significant community, but not a single big outbreak like Kirklees or other areas that had a workplace outbreak. It can have the same effect because it can drive up the cases, but what we are seeing from looking at the postcode data of those cases is, in the last couple of weeks, is that what we are seeing is a single case being infected, then going back to a household and all that household becoming infected. And when we look at the data what we can see is clusters in a part of the town, but the clusters are household clusters, so a number of those are causing the rising tide event and we know that they are in mainly south Asian areas, and they are in areas with high number of terraced houses with high numbers of occupants in the house, so four or more, five or more people in the household. He said the Blackburn with Darwen borough, which has an Asian population of about 28%, had 114 cases in the last two weeks and 97 of those cases were among south Asians. The rate of confirmed cases per 100,000 has gone up to 47 per 100,000, up from 31.6 cases in the seven days to 4 July. The authority is third on the list of highest weekly rates, behind Leicester, which has a rate of 118.2 cases per 100,000 and is subject to a local lockdown, and nearby Pendle, with a rate of 76.6. The luxury British brand Burberry is to cut 500 jobs worldwide, including 150 in its UK head office, to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the coronavirus pandemic. Retail sales dived by 48% in the three months to the end of June, including a 75% fall in Europe and the Middle East, as countries closed shops and offices and severely limited travel to control the spread of Covid-19. Burberry said it would keep its headquarters in the UK but would “further streamline” head office roles, reduce office space and “improve retail efficiency” outside the UK. The company said it wanted to reinvest the savings in marketing activities including pop-up stores, digital campaigns, events and improved store displays. The £55m in savings come on top of £140m of cost cuts already announced. The brand, best known for its trench coats and signature check, had previously cancelled its end-of-year payment to shareholders, worth about £120m last year, and has borrowed £300m via the UK government-backed business support scheme. More than 1 million British smokers have apparently kicked the habit since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). It calculated that 1,036,000 smokers and recent ex-smokers had quit or continued their abstinence since coronavirus cases began circulating in the UK. The charity surveyed more than 10,000 people across England, Wales and Scotland, including 1,700 smokers and people who had quit in the last four months. It found that younger smokers were more likely to have stopped than older smokers – 17% of smokers and recent ex-smokers aged between 16-29 said they had quit compared with 7% of those older than 50. And 13% aged 30 to 49 had quit during the pandemic. A regional breakdown found that smokers in the north-east of England were more likely to have quit than anywhere else in the country – 20% of smokers said they had kicked the habit since the pandemic. Wales and the east Midlands recorded the smallest quit rates, with 8% of smokers and former smokers saying they had stopped smoking. Top chefs have rallied behind Tom Kerridge after he criticised “selfish” and “disgraceful” customers for failing to show up and honour their reservations. They also raised concerns about the high costs of landlord rents, which they still have to pay despite operating at half capacity, and the risks associated with a lack of custom. Over the weekend, Kerridge criticised 27 people who did not turn up at the Corinthia Hotel in central London without letting the restaurant know. In an interview with the Guardian, Kerridge said: “There has been a huge response from the industry around no shows. It happens all the time but quite often people accept it or don’t talk about it.” Read more here. Nurses not wearing face masks or staying two metres apart led to an outbreak of Covid-19 that shut an A&amp;E unit after 70 staff at a hospital had to go into quarantine, an inquiry has found. An investigation by Hillingdon hospital in north-west London has found that a nurse who had coronavirus unwittingly infected 16 others during a training session they all attended on 30 June, in what was described by a doctor as a “super-spreading event”. The hospital, which serves Boris Johnson’s constituency, made headlines last week when it stopped accepting emergency admissions because the outbreak had led to 70 staff being off work and in isolation. The government has no plans to make people wear face coverings in offices, health secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told Sky News: We will not be recommending masks in the office. Asked to clear up confusion over mask-wearing, he said it would be mandatory in shops from 24 July. But in hospitality, such as in a restaurant, there needs to be table service so it was not necessary to wear a mask. On how long the extended lockdown in Leicester would last, he said: We are taking the decision later this week. By the end of the week we will announce the next steps, whether to make any changes and if so what changes to make. It’s all driven by the data and our assessment of how well the team are doing locally. He denied reports that chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking to raise capital gain tax to claw back some of the money used to fund thew Covid-19 crisis. He said: As far as I understand there is no proposal and the chancellor is not looking at tax changes now. A quick look at some of today’s front pages.

A new study has found that the rate of coronavirus infection in England was significantly reduced in May , the month before lockdown restrictions were lifted. The research, from Imperial College London found that the overall reproduction number was 0.57 - lower than previously thought. According to the study the rate of infection throughout the country was halving every eight to nine days during May.

About 69% of those who tested positive reported no symptoms on the day of the test or the previous week, though they may have developed symptoms later. The report provides an insight into who was infected with the virus between 1 May and 1 June, comparing geography, age, sex, ethnicity, key worker status and symptoms. In other news, the government’s decision to strip Huawei equipment from its 5G network features prominently in today’s papers. China’s ambassador in London claimed the decision is “disappointing” and “wrong” in a tweet last night.

Here’s what made the news today: The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the Coalition’s attempt to push nuclear power as an option to address the energy crisis is a “complete joke”. The federal government will renew the gas security mechanism beyond its due expiry date of 1 January next year and will also review how it works. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, confirmed that before the election, defence was working on a plan to purchase two Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US by 2030, as a stop-gap before nuclear submarines could be made in Australia. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, accused Dutton of playing “rank politics” in making the statements. Covid booster doses will be recommended for at-risk children between 12 and 15 years old. The Victorian government will offer payments of $3,000 to all staff working in public hospitals and ambulance services in recognition of the challenging circumstances they’ve faced. The NT will close its Covid-19 quarantine facility on 16 June. There were 59 reported Covid-19 deaths across Australia. Until tomorrow, I hope you keep warm. In a bid to tackle the meteoric rise of financial scam ads, Google will require advertisers of financial services in Australia to demonstrate they are authorised by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) and have gone through Google’s advertiser verification program to promote products and services. The same policy of regulator verification is already in place in the UK, and the new regime will be rolled out in Australia from 30 August, 2022. Google’s government affairs and public policy senior manager Samantha Yorke said: We work tirelessly to make sure the ads we serve are safe and trustworthy, and we know that partnering and collaborating with government regulators is critical to our success. That’s why we’re closely coordinating with the appropriate Australian regulators to make sure this program is effective at scale. In the coming months, we plan to further expand these verification requirements to advertisers in additional countries and regions. In 2021, the company blocked or removed over 58.9m ads for violating the financial services policy. The ACCC reported that Australians lost more than $205m in the first four months of 2022 with the majority of losses coming from “crypto-investment scams” which increased by over 300%. A staffer of former One Nation senator Brian Burston has accused him of regular sexual harassment, saying his behaviour, including allegedly shoving money down her breasts, left her feeling degraded, humiliated and disgusted. AAP reports Terri-lea Vairy was called to give evidence in the federal court on Thursday on behalf of Pauline Hanson, who is being sued for defamation by Burston. Burston says the One Nation leader accused him of sexual harassment on social media, via a text message to his wife, Rosalyn Burston, and during a television interview. The 74-year-old denies all allegations as entirely fabricated. Mirvac seeks to evict lessee of 10 Travelodge hotels Property developer Mirvac has launched urgent court proceedings against the lessee of 10 Travelodge hotels, seeking to evict them ahead of a scheduled sale of the properties. AAP reports that in the NSW Supreme Court lawsuit, Mirvac seeks orders that leases with Value Lodging be terminated so an acquisition of the hotels by fund manager Salter Brothers can go ahead. The leases, which began in June 2020, relate to properties in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane. Mirvac sought to terminate the contracts after the sale to the Salter Brothers was confirmed in July 2021. Despite being served with the notices of termination in March this year, Value Lodging refused to vacate the premises, claiming the notices were invalid and disputing the notice period given to move out. Mirvac has sought urgent declarations from the court, claiming the acquisition of the properties by Salter Brothers depends on the hotels being vacant. “(If) vacant possession of the properties is not delivered by Mirvac by 30 June 2022, Mirvac will incur financing costs, time value of money costs, direct interest costs, and opportunity costs,” wrote Mirvac’s solicitor Jonathan Light in an affidavit. As well as the declarations, Mirvac is also seeking its legal costs. The case is being heard by Justice Rowan Darke. Clive Palmer’s United Australia party spent nearly $1.5m on Google advertising on the last day of the election alone, as political parties poured millions into social media posts in the dying days of the federal campaign despite the advertising “blackout” period. Queensland coalminers in the dark about royalties increase Coalminers still don’t know how much tax they will be paying in Queensland in three weeks’ time, AAP reports. State treasurer Cameron Dick says miners will pay more tax on each tonne of coal sold, known as royalties, next financial year. He is yet to reveal the size of the hike coming in the June 21 budget. “It’ll be fair for the industry, but very importantly it’ll be fair for the people of our state,” Dick told reporters on Thursday. The Queensland Resources Council said the treasurer refused to reveal the new royalty rates in meeting with miners on Wednesday. “(That) flies in the face of Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s promise to be an open and transparent government,” the QRC told AAP in a statement on Thursday. “The coal industry is facing a rate rise in two weeks, and does not know what to expect.” The QRC has warned that a royalty hike will scare away foreign investors, but Mr Dick denies that will happen. The treasurer also insists he is still a friend of the mining industry. “But the point of being a friend, and the value of friendship, is being able to tell the truth,” Dick said. “And the truth is that these companies have been making very significant amounts of money.” The New South Wales supreme court has dismissed an application from cosmetic surgeon Joseph Ajaka for Nine’s 60 Minutes to hand over copies of a program about him. In a brief hearing Justice Stephen Rothman handed down his decision on Thursday afternoon with the words “submission dismissed” and ordered that Ajaka pay Nine’s costs. He has not yet published his reasons. On Wednesday the NSW court of appeal ruled that the supreme court did not have power to make its initial document discovery order on 13 May which said 60 Minutes should hand over a draft copy of the story. Chief Justice Andrew Bell said that legal counsel for Ajaka had conceded the orders “made by Justice Rothman on the afternoon of 13th May 2022 were not sustained by any jurisdiction in the court. Those orders must therefore be set aside”. Last month Ajaka won a court order at the eleventh hour preventing the broadcast of the program, reported by award-winning investigative journalist Adele Ferguson, and the publication of any subsequent articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. In case you missed how definitive the energy minister, Chris Bowen, was about a nuclear energy debate. Tasmania expedites inquest into deaths of children in jumping castle tragedy A joint public inquest into the deaths of six children in a freak jumping castle mishap in Tasmania has been given priority by the state coroner, AAP reports. The Hillcrest primary school students were enjoying end-of-year celebrations in December when a gust of wind flung the castle and several inflatable Zorb balls about 10 metres into the air. Three other students suffered serious injuries and spent time in hospital. Tasmania’s coronial division on Thursday indicated a joint inquest would be held into the tragedy and a “large amount” of investigative work had already taken place. “The coroner (Olivia McTaggart) wishes to advise that she will give priority to scheduling the inquest as soon as reasonably possible,” a statement from the division said. Evidence from Tasmania Police, including witness statements, has been provided to the coroner. Information from a Work Safe Tasmania investigation concerning the involved business, equipment and set-up will soon be provided. The coroner will likely consider evidence from engineering and scientific experts, as well as meteorology experts in relation to weather conditions. Jalailah Jayne-Marie Jones, Addison Stewart, Jye Sheehan, Zane Mellor, Peter Dodt and Chace Harrison were remembered at funerals in the northwest city of Devonport. Tributes left outside the school were collected by the Devonport City Council for the creation of a permanent memorial. Jones accuses Dutton of leaking sensitive information Jones accuses the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of leaking confidential information in revealing he was in discussions to buy stop-gap submarines from the United States before the election. Jones: I’d have thought that Peter Dutton might have learned from the mistakes of Scott Morrison about disclosing confidential information between world leaders. In that case, Emmanuel Macron by text message. This isn’t the way a grown-up conducts international relations, let alone sensitive military negotiations with a partner, a defence partner. Grown-ups don’t do that. He didn’t say whether the information was classified or not: Whether it was classified or not, it was certainly sensitive and it certainly compromised our defence partners and our allies and the United States. You don’t do this stuff. Stephen Jones: We must make it easier for super funds to invest locally The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is on ABC’s afternoon briefing. He says he wants to make it easier for superannuation funds to invest locally, arguing the changes made by the former government made it more attractive for the funds to invest overseas. Jones: Funds want to invest in Australia, these are patriotic institutions and members want to see their funds making Australia stronger, better, wealthy and we can do all of those things without compromising returns so we will level the playing field and ensure, unlike the last government, we don’t put in place adverse incentives where crazily it is easier to invest overseas than to invest in Australia. He says the government won’t be like the former government in raiding superannuation to fund home deposits: We don’t think Australians should have to choose between having a retirement savings nest, a nest egg for their retirement savings, and buy a house. They should do both. Rio Tinto will invest in large-scale wind and solar farms in central and southern Queensland to power its aluminium operations in the Gladstone region, AAP reports. The resources giant’s aluminium chief Ivan Vella on Thursday announced a call-out for proposals to meet the energy needs of the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland alumina refinery. “It is early in the process, but this is an important step towards meeting our group climate change target of halving our emissions by the end of the decade (from 2018 levels),” Vella said. At least 4000 megawatts of wind and solar power will be needed to run the facilities, roughly the equivalent of two coal-fired power plants. “This is an important moment for Queensland,” Australian Conservation Foundation Gladstone campaigner Jaclyn McCosker said. “Coupled with the news that energy ministers have agreed to come up with a national transition plan to phase out fossil fuels, this marks a significant moment in Australian action to tackle climate change.” Rio Tinto’s pitch to renewable energy developers follows the signing last October of a statement of cooperation with the Queensland government to establish more renewable energy sources in the regions. The new wind and solar projects will have to start supplying power to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone operations through the Queensland grid by 2030, but there are concerns transmission infrastructure is falling short. “In Central and Northern Queensland there’s currently a cap on how much clean energy can be developed locally because there’s a dire need to upgrade grid infrastructure,” Solar Citizens spokeswoman Stephanie Gray said. Queensland Minister for Energy Mick de Brenni has been contacted for comment on grid stress. Work has also begun on the $2bn state-owned MacIntyre wind farm in the Southern Downs, which will be one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. The federal Labor government has pledged $20bn to finance more grid infrastructure, and plans to accelerate new renewable energy, battery storage and transmission nationwide. Bill allowing Labor to cost policies in lead-up to NSW election passes lower house The NSW parliament is closer to passing legislation allowing the Labor party to cost its policies in the lead-up to next year’s state election, AAP reports. A Labor bill passed in the lower house on Thursday allowing all promises made in the lead-up to the March election to be scrutinised from an earlier date. The legislation would see the parliamentary budget office (PBO) begin operating from 1 July, two months earlier than the usual 1 September. The PBO is an apolitical team of professionals which provides costings of all election promises. The Parliamentary Budget Officer Amendment Bill 2022 passed the lower house by division on Thursday, 43 to 39 and will be sent to the upper house for debate. Shadow treasurer Daniel Mookhey said on Tuesday the legislation would ensure all promises made in the lead-up to the 2023 state election could be delivered. Mookhey told media on Thursday Labor had since received advice there was a possibility the PBO could not come online until August – giving staff just one extra month to audit election promises. “This isn’t an opportunity for the government to play politics,” he said. “We want to get a mandate for change for our policies that we will be taking to the election next year.” New trade ministers head to WTO in Geneva The trade minister, Don Farrell and the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, have announced they will attend the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Geneva from 12 to 15 June. Prior to that, Ayres will be leading Australia’s delegation to the OECD annual ministerial council meeting in Paris on 9 and 10 June. The focus will be supporting governments dealing with Covid-19 challenges, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, vaccine access, digital trade and food security. Farrell: We will also seek to tackle important longer-term challenges, including by agreeing new rules to limit subsidies that undermine fish stocks, and reinvigorating discussions to reform global agriculture markets. Ayres: In Paris, I will convene a meeting of key WTO Ministers which I will use to press for a package that will address the challenges facing the global trading system, including a response to the pandemic. Some stats from the weekly NSW Health surveillance report on Covid and the flu (via the NSW Health Twitter account): PCR testing decreased, with 170,195 PCR tests reported this week, a 10% decrease since the previous week. The proportion of PCR tests that were positive for Covid-19 decreased to 11%. 460 people with Covid-19 were admitted to hospital and 39 were admitted to ICU this week, which is a decrease on the previous week. There were 86 Covid-19 deaths reported this week. Of these, all were eligible for a third dose of a vaccine but only 54 (63%) had received a third dose. Five of the deaths reported were in people aged under 65 years. The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is currently the dominant Covid-19 variant circulating in the NSW community, with BA.2 the predominant sub-lineage. The proportion of specimens identified as the BA.5 sub-lineage has been increasing in recent weeks. Of the 53,271 tests conducted for flu at sentinel laboratories, the proportion of positive tests remained relatively stable at around 16-17%. Emergency department presentations for “influenza-like illness” (ILI) requiring an admission have increased to 220 compared to 198 admissions in the previous week. This represents 15% of all ILI emergency department presentations this week. The proportion of presentations that were admitted to hospital was highest for people aged 65 years and over (51%), 35-64 years (18%) and children aged 0-4 years (16%). Pauline Hanson reappears One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been spotted in public for the first time since she was struck down with Covid-19 just before the election. Hanson had not been seen publicly even after the Covid isolation period, lying low as the election results came in. Hanson looks likely to be re-elected to the Senate again following the May election, but it has been a closely fought contest between her and LNP senator Amanda Stoker over the last Queensland Senate spot. The senator appeared outside the federal court hearing a defamation case between her and former Senate and party colleague Brian Burston. You can read more about that case here: Interest rate rises expected to curtail growth in new home sales Growth in new homes sales declined in May and further falls are anticipated as rising interest rates begin to bite, AAP reports. The Housing Industry Association monthly new home sales report – a survey of the nation’s largest home builders in the five largest states – showed a decline of 5.5% in May compared to a month earlier. HIA economist Tom Devitt said the result was not surprising in a month containing both a federal election and an interest rate hike. He said while sales were strong during the first months of 2022, ongoing increases in interest rates are expected to bring this boom cycle to an end. “The impact of rising rates will be compounded by the ongoing increases in the cost of construction and land, forcing up the cost of a new house and land package,” Devitt said. But he said there is a significant volume of work under construction and elevated levels of work approved but not yet commenced. This will see a significant lag before the rise in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s cash rate adversely impacts on the number of new homes commencing construction. “The lag from when a rate rise results in a decline in starts can be as short as six months, but in this cycle, it could be more than 12 months before the volume of starts fall due to the rise in rates,” he said. The RBA followed up on its 25 basis point increase in May this week with a further 50 basis point hike in the cash rate, taking it to 0.85%. Victoria led the decline in new home sales in May, dropping by 12.7%, followed by NSW and Western Australia, down 12.2% and 0.8% respectively. However, sales rose 8.8% on Queensland and were up 12% in South Australia. Peter Dutton on deportations to New Zealand Dutton also commented on the possibility Labor could water down visa cancellations due to New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s upcoming trip and representations about the policy: The New Zealand government’s been clear in that position for a long time, and I understand that, but we’ve made a decision that we would deport criminals, particularly the most serious people that have committed sexual offences against women and children ... drug dealers, traffickers, people who’ve committed murder, people who weren’t Australian citizens but who committed crimes against Australian citizens and it was right to deport them and we’re safer because of having done so. I don’t want to see the Albanese government walk it back as, you know, we tried to strengthen the laws. They wouldn’t support that and in opposition they were very weak on these deportations, in fact, they were weak in government. Between Scott Morrison, myself, Karen Andrews, we deported about 10,100 of these criminals. And we know that when Labor was in government over the same period they did about 1,100. Now the numbers will drop off again, no doubt, under this government ... yes, I understand why New Zealand wouldn’t want them back but they’re citizens of New Zealand as UK and elsewhere and that’s where they should go back to, so I think we’ve acted in our best interest. If Anthony Albanese tries to wind that back, I think that would be a devastating outcome. Peter Dutton on high court judgement on stripping citizenship Earlier, Peter Dutton also weighed in on the high court’s decision that the home affairs minister’s power to strip dual nationals of Australian citizenship for engaging in suspected terrorist activities are invalid. Duton told 2GB Radio: The government needs to take the advice, to look at the judgment and to work out what the legislative response needs to be, and this needs to happen as a matter of urgency because we don’t want these people paroled and back out on the street and having the opportunity to commit a terrorist offence. The threat of terrorism hasn’t gone away. I mean we, pray God, haven’t seen an attack in London or Paris or in our own country. That doesn’t mean that these people have given up their ideology or that they’re not a threat to to Australians, and we will do whatever we can to support the government to pass legislation. The government is not bringing parliament back till the 26th of July. But if parliament needs to resume next week, or the week after, we will be there and we’ll support them doing that because there is an urgency to this and we need to hear from the attorney general Mark Dreyfus. As to what the answer is, what the legislation response needs to be, and, and we will support any sensible proposal that they put forward. Labor has played down the need for any changes, as only two people will get their citizenship back as a result of the decision – the plaintiff Delil Alexander, and one other. There are also other powers to prevent risks from Australian citizens suspected of terrorism including temporary exclusion orders and control orders. The Centre for National Resilience Covid-19 quarantine facility in the Northern Territory is set to close, chief minister Natasha Fyles says. AAP reports the closure is scheduled for 16 June, and will happen when the territory’s public health emergency ends, along with the vaccine mandate for workers. “The Centre for National Resilience will cease operations, but it will be ready to stand up if we as a territory or Australia need it,” Fyles told reporters on Thursday. “It was that facility that when Covid first appeared in the world got Australians out of situations when they were stuck overseas. “We saw thousands be able to come home through that facility, and it was something Territorians should be proud of.” Fyles acknowledged the hundreds of AUSMAT and NT health staff who worked at the Howard Springs facility since it opened in late 2020. At the centre’s busiest, staff cared for up to 2,000 people per fortnight, but it is currently empty. Fyles said the NT was working with the commonwealth, and the centre would remain on standby for the next 12 months. Also set to end on June 16 are the NT’s virus exclusion zones, rules for high-risk settings, such as aged-care facilities, and safety measures for businesses, with further details set to be released over the next week. Major-event and cruise-ship limits and lock-in areas will also cease, along with the controversial vaccine mandate that required most workers to have three jabs. Fyles said workplaces would now be able to implement their own vaccination policies and decide whether they allowed staff who had lost their jobs for failing to comply with the mandate to return. Darwin’s Covid-19 vaccination and testing centres will close on 30 June. Virus reporting and isolation rules stay, along with face mask requirements for some settings. The chief health officer will also retain the power to issue directions for up to two years, including mandating masks and vaccines, under recently passed legislation. “We must remember as we step forward the threat does remain,’’ Fyles said. The territory’s high vaccination rate and the slowing spread of the virus and its prevalence in the community are behind the decision. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, has confirmed a report in the Australian that before the election defence was working on a plan to purchase two Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US by 2030, as a stop-gap before nuclear submarines could be made in Australia. Dutton told 2GB Radio: I thought we could be in a position to make an announcement around July or August. So it was always our intention to not get to the end of the 18 month consultation but to get part way through it, make a decision on which submarine we’re going to go with and then use the balance of the 18 months to work out the detail of that ... I really worried how Labor are walking away from Aukus, from the submarine deal. And that is clearly not in our national interest ... Nuclear powered submarines, particularly with the vertical launch capabilities, provide a great deterrent. So I hope that they can reconsider, because they’re making all sorts of excuses at the moment ... defence is never a priority for them. And that’s what we saw in the last few years. I just think there’s a lot of the language, which is either ill informed, [Albanese] either hasn’t had the briefings yet or is rejecting the advice because the advice was pretty clear and specific to us. And that is that you couldn’t have diesel powered submarine really working in some parts where it needs to work in the shores of our country ... beyond 2035. And if Labor thinks there’s a cheap option here to build a new diesel electric submarine ... then I think that’s folly and it just worries me. Dutton said he “always had [his] suspicions” that Labor “was never truly supportive of Aukus”. “I just get a feeling that they’re preparing the ground to walk away from it and that really concerns me,” he said. A feeling in your waters and a regular Thursday slot on 2GB is all you need, really. Resources minister on security mechanism changes The press conference has now ended with Madeleine King saying she’s not worried about upsetting gas companies with changes to the security mechanism: I’m not worried about putting anyone’s noses out of joint. My priority is to make sure there’s affordable and adequate supply of gas for the eastern states of Australia. Bowen can’t say yet when AEMO might begin to have gas storage up and running He says: We’ll work that through with AEMO. There’s a process. Ministers have agreed so it’s endorsed but now there’s a process of rule making. I’d like to see that happen as quickly as possible. I’m sure that AEMO will make the decisions waiting for the rule making. We met last night. There’s some issues that need to be worked through. He says it won’t happen overnight, and criticises the Coalition for complaining it isn’t being fixed so quickly after just being kicked out of government: We won’t be able to purchase and install gas overnight. That’s true. There’s some rule making changes. If we had this capacity last week it could’ve helped. If AEMO and ministers had this last week, this crisis started to break on Tuesday and Wednesday, we were sworn in on Wednesday, here we are a week later, endorsing the rule change. The Liberal party are saying this isn’t happening quick enough, the Liberal party is like the rock band that trashes the hotel room and complains it’s not cleaned up before breakfast. They created the mess and the new government is fixing the mess. We’re going back to the room. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Thursday, as the country records at least 59 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 775 In hospital: 87 (with no one in ICU) NSW Deaths: 21 Cases: 8,201 In hospital: 1,263 (with 40 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 250 In hospital: 16 (with no one in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 9 Cases: 3,861 In hospital: 297 (with 11 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,801 In hospital: 234 (with 5 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 624 In hospital: 37 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 22 Cases: 8,903 In hospital: 517 (with 29 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 5 Cases: 7,871 In hospital: 293 (with 16 people in ICU) When asked about the Coalition pushing Labor to explore nuclear as a fuel option, energy minister Chris Bowen says “Bring it on! It’s just a complete joke”. Bowen: Seriously? A couple of points. Nine years in office and then coming up with bright ideas on the other side of the election is point one. No credibility. Point two – nuclear is the most expensive form of energy. We have a cost of living crisis. Energy prices going through the roof. And what’s the big bright idea? They say “let’s have the most expensive form of energy we can possibly think of? Let’s come up with the most expensive form of energy and put that in there because that will make the power prices cheaper?” They want that debate? Bring it on! It’s just a complete joke. Question: Would you consider cash payments for those in dire straits due to [energy prices]? Bowen: The treasurer said that we went to the election with a considerable cost of living package which will be in the October budget. We will sensibly look at anything else that we can do. But we’ll concentrating on that cost relief, cost of living relief, that we went to the election with. Now we are hearing from the resources minister, Madeleine King. King says the Australian domestic gas security mechanism is due to expire on 1 January next year, and the cabinet resolved today to make sure that tool remains so that the government can ensure future supplies of gas in Australia, so the mechanism will be renewed through regulation. The government will also conduct an urgent review of the domestic gas security mechanism. She said: As Minister Bowen has pointed out, it is a long and complicated and convoluted, ineffective mechanism, that takes a very long time to produce results. We are determined to change that and we’re determined to make sure that this mechanism, as well as the other tools available to us, are all on the table so that we can ensure that gas supplies are appropriate, adequate and affordable for Australians right across the country. She said cabinet also agreed to renegotiate the heads of government agreement between the gas companies and the prime minister, with a “distinctive edge” to respond to the gas crisis. We need to have this heads of agreement renewed so that we can again, along with the Domestic Gas Security, ensure that there are gas supplies that are affordable and adequate for the southern Australian states. Bowen says he is pleased with the progress made at last night’s state and territory energy ministers’ meeting. He says the most important thing to emerge from the meeting is giving AEMO the power to store and buy gas. He says: Most importantly from my point of view, working now to give AEMO the power to buy and store gas so that it is kept for a crisis situation and can be released at AEMO’s discretion is something that would have been useful in recent times, and something that will be useful in coming times. Secondly, the state and territory ministers agreeing with me to progress the capacity mechanism process. The previous government had said that they would work towards it coming into place in 2025. We need to do better than that. But we also need to make sure that we get it right, and that includes ensuring that it supports new technologies, renewable energy and storage. And that is the instructions that ministers gave last night. As I’ve said, I am encouraging the Energy Security Board to expedite their work and get it out for further consultation as soon as possible. There will be a lot of detailed work for people to see. There’s been a lot of work done by the Energy Security Board. I look forward to seeing their work being made public in the coming days. Union on ABC ‘knifing’ library services jobs The Community and Public Sector Union has slammed the ABC’s plans to abolish 58 positions and make journalists research and archive their own stories. The CPSU said the ABC cannot continue to sack its world class specialist staff and expect to remain the nation’s most trusted storyteller. CPSU ABC section secretary Sinddy Ealy: This proposal will see over 1,200 hours a week of archival work fall by the wayside, potentially jeopardising national archival footage, music and work. The ABC has developed this proposal before it has even consulted with program makers about what they need from the ABC Archives in order to do their work. This proposal is an unfortunate example of ambitious and future-focused management being out of touch with the day to day running of the organisation, frontline workers are best place to know that automated workflows are not up and running to the level needed to be to avoid catastrophic loss of archival materials and the hasty decision to sack specialist staff will absolutely risk breaking new stories making it to air. This proposal is tech driven not content driven which is highly problematic when it does not have a realistic take on where the organisation is at presently. The last time the ABC took a knife to its library services in 2019, it promised there would no more loss of specialist work, yet here we are. ABC staff are at the frontline of digitisation and the early uptake of technology, they always have been but not at the expense of dumbing down content or quality like this change could see. ACCC report on NBN download speeds The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said 14% of fibre-to-the-node NBN connections struggle to get speeds over 75% of what they’re paying for. The data is contained in the latest measuring broadband report from the ACCC, which is released every three months looking at how the national broadband network is performing. The 14% is up 1% on the previous report, the ACCC said. “The ACCC has consistently called for NBN Co and retailers to improve these physical connections so that consumers on fibre to the node technology achieve speeds closer to their plan speed,” ACCC commissioner Anna Brakey said. The report found that download speeds in urban areas had improved, from 85.7% of the promised speed in 2018 to 98.2% in February this year. Regional areas have improved from 83.7% to 95.2% The report found people in urban areas on fixed NBN connections still have better speeds than those on fixed connections in regional areas. “Regional fixed-line services have improved over the last four years, but still have some way to go to be on par with urban connections,” Brakey said. Overall, the average download and upload speeds dropped between December last year and February this year. “Speeds are generally holding up well, however most retailers experienced a small drop in speed in February during the busy evening hours,” Brakey said. NBN Co is already in the process of offering full fibre-to-the-home upgrades to up to 2m homes, and the new Labor government’s policy will see that upgrade offered to a further 1.5m. South Australia has reported zero Covid-19 deaths today, with 2,801 new cases, 234 in hospital and five of those in intensive care. With that, I will pass you on to the sterling Josh Taylor who will be with you for the rest of the day. Western Australia’s premier Mark McGowan has released today’s Covid update. There have been 7,871 new cases reported and five further deaths to 8pm last night. The state’s deaths may date back to previous days and weeks but were reported to WA Health yesterday. There are 293 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 16 people in ICU. Marles to meet defence counterparts from Japan and US Deputy prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles will attend a three-way meeting with Japanese minister of defence Kishi Nobuo and US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month. The high level security conference, to take place from 10 June to 12 June, will be his first overseas engagement as defence minister. Senior defence officials from more than 30 nations will be in attendance for speeches and talks on key strategic issues. Marles: I am honoured to represent Australia at such an important forum to discuss security challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region in complex and challenging times. The Indo-Pacific is in the midst of the most consequential strategic alignment of our time. I welcome the role this Dialogue plays in shaping robust conversation on strategic challenges and regional security dynamics. Australia remains committed to working with our partners across the region to promote our shared interests of a peaceful, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific. I look forward to sharing Australia’s strategic outlook at the Dialogue, and outlining our regional priorities. The three-way meeting with Japan and the US will be the 10th trilateral defence ministers meeting to take place. ABC chief questioned over archivist jobs The ABC managing director, David Anderson, has been door-stopped at Parliament House in Canberra about the proposal to slash 58 archivist and librarian jobs at the public broadcaster. Anderson told reporters: The archives initiative is something the ABC has had in train for a while, we’ve been digitising the archives, making it more accessible for our content makers. That’s all I have to say about it. We’re in consultation, so when we launch these initiatives ... we consult with staff and their representatives, and that will take place over the next six weeks. Asked if it will compromise the ability to tell Australian stories if only flagship programs have access to library staff, Anderson replied: No, we don’t believe that it will compromise our ability to tell local stories. We do value our archives. We work closely with the National Archives Australia. We don’t believe it will. It’s a change we’re putting in place, a transformation for the future - certainly, to allow our content makers to access more easily the archive that we have. Anderson said the ABC is “always there for all Australians, telling stories is what we do”. It’s an initiative we’ve thought through carefully, we will take feedback from people and answer people’s concerns that they might have in this period of time. Anderson said the ABC will meet its legislative obligations in the Archives Act and its charter. In Queensland, detectives have charged two people following the discovery of human remains at the Glass House Mountains on Tuesday. Forensic testing is under way to determine the identity of the remains, however police say they are believed to be those of Donna Howe, a 57-year-old Caboolture woman, who was last seen in late April. Yesterday police executed a search warrant. Two men from Caboolture have both been charged with one count each of murder and misconduct with a corpse. They will appear at Caboolture magistrates court today. Remember the election? Declarations are continuing until next week, while the latest date of the return of writs is 28 June. The AEC has warned for some contests “the entire allowable period” may be needed to complete the count and formally declare the result. NSW superintendent Darrin Batchelor has provided an update on the 11-year-old boy discovered this morning after going missing yesterday afternoon. Christopher was found close to home by a member of the public driving along a road near his house around 9.15am. Batchelor says the woman saw a person matching his description walking along the road, asked him who he was and he said his name was Chris. She gave him some water and a muesli bar and he was “happy to be in some warmth”. It’s fantastic ... we haven’t filled in all the pieces of the puzzle yet but it looks like Christopher went on a little bit of an adventure yesterday afternoon and overnight he put his head down somewhere, we think in some bushland and this morning he was located heading back towards home so it’s a fantastic outcome. He’s been transported to ... hospital for a thorough examination and there’s no visible injuries ... so it looks like at this stage possible mild hypothermia but ... it must’ve been absolutely freezing for him out there. Batchelor said the family was “extremely relieved” and had been distraught with worry overnight. Police asked him a few questions but he was quiet this morning and it hasn’t been confirmed why he left. Bullets fired into home of boxer Justis Huni Australian heavyweight boxing champion Justis Huni’s home has been shot up in a drive-by attack in southern Brisbane, AAP reports. Five bullets were fired into the 23-year-old’s property on Goorong Street in Sunnybank Hills about 4am on Thursday. No one was hurt by the hail of gunfire, but it is understood there were 10 people home at the time of the attack, including children. Despite the terrifying ordeal, the boxing champ stuck to his rigorous training schedule in the lead-up to his heavyweight bout against Joe Goodall at Brisbane’s Nissan Arena next week, with the winner touted for a potential world title shot. Huni’s promoter Sean Lawson told AAP: He actually still went training this morning – got to keep it normal. Ironically enough, they usually wake up at four o’clock ... this morning was a different wake-up call with five bullets through the windows. The gunshots shattered windows in the home’s front lounge room. Lawson insisted Huni remained unrattled by the incident and his preparations had not been derailed for the upcoming contest with Goodall. The undefeated Australian pair were initially due to fight in February before a second Covid-19 infection for Huni put the event on hold. Queensland siege ends A Queensland siege has concluded after more than 18 hours following the arrest of two men. The emergency declaration has been lifted in Nerang, allowing people to return to their homes. The men were under police pursuit in relation to return to prison warrants. The emergency situation was declared shortly after 3.00 yesterday afternoon when a standoff ensued between the police and the two men. ACT moves on drug decriminalisation bill The ACT government has just moved to pass a bill decriminalising possession of small quantities of some illicit drugs. Under territory law enacted a year ago, Canberrans are already able to possess up to 50 grams of dried cannabis and 150 grams of wet cannabis. A (maroon) bridge too far? The Queensland maroons belted it home in last night’s state of origin. If rugby isn’t your thing, state rivalries are sure to wet your whistle. We are still waiting to hear from NSW premier Dominic Perrottet on the loss, with Queensland one step closer to seeing the harbour bridge go maroon. His last post was this cursed image 22 hours ago: New Queensland funding for housing supply The Queensland government has announced $200 million towards essential infrastructure to free up housing supply as part of this year’s state budget. Minister for planning Steven Miles said the funding would be directed towards residential lots in new communities: People and businesses are moving to Queensland in droves to enjoy the economic, job and lifestyle opportunities on offer. This has increased demand for land supply, especially in south-east Queensland. The funding will be supplemented by property developers, who will be required to make co-investments of at least 20% towards the cost of major infrastructure going into their development projects. Victorian opposition criticised for ‘knocking the health system’ In Victoria, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation’s secretary is not impressed by the state opposition’s messaging around healthcare and hospitals throughout the pandemic. The minister for health and aged care, Mark Butler, has announced Covid booster doses will be recommended for at-risk children between 12 and 15 years old. People most at risk of severe disease are encouraged to receive a dose of the Pfizer vaccine from 14 June following Atagi advice. To be eligible for a booster dose, the children must have completed a primary course three or more months ago, and meet one or more of these criteria: Be severely immunocompromised. Have a disability with significant or complex health needs. Have complex and/or multiple health conditions that increase the risk of severe Covid. Atagi is not recommending a booster dose for all children between 12 and 15 years old at this stage, as evidence shows otherwise healthy adolescents who have received two doses remain “well protected” against severe disease. Butler said: I welcome Atagi’s advice to make boosters available to around 120,000 vulnerable young Australians who have significant health conditions. I encourage all those eligible for these boosters to book in. Atagi recommended all Australians receive an influenza vaccine as soon as possible, because after a few flu seasons with low transmission rates, there is a chance this season could be a difficult one. Protect yourself and your family this winter by getting boosted and vaccinated for Covid and influenza. Police investigate Brisbane shooting Queensland Police are investigating after multiple shots were fired into a house at Sunnybank Hills in Brisbane’s outer south this morning. Around 4am, police were called to Goorong Street after reports of loud noises and vehicles driving off at speed. Three hours later, officers were called back to a property on the same street where at least five shots had been fired into a property. A number of occupants were home at the time, but nobody was injured. Casino regulators in New South Wales and Victoria have given approval to the takeover of Crown Resorts by US private equity group Blackstone. It’s one of the last hurdles before Blackstone can take control – it now needs approval by the Western Australia regulator to run Crown’s Perth casino, and a tick-off from the federal court. Shareholders – the largest of which is James Packer – approved the deal last month. The NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority chair, Philip Crawford, said Blackstone had been subject to an extensive probity assessment that focused on its ability to fix the problems identified last year after an inquiry run by former judge Patricia Bergin. Bergin found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its casinos in Sydney and Melbourne and that junket operators who brought in high rollers from overseas were linked to organised crime. Crawford said: As the prospective owner of Crown Resorts, Blackstone has been required to demonstrate the highest standards of probity as well as a commitment to deliver the full suite of operational changes recommended by the Bergin inquiry. This commitment is vital to ensure Crown Sydney is free from criminal influence and properly manages the risks of harm associated with casino activities. We have more on the one-off payment to health workers from Victoria correspondent Benita Kolovos. The Victorian government will offer payments of $3,000 to all staff working in public hospitals and ambulance services in recognition of the challenging circumstances they’ve faced. The premier, Daniel Andrews, this morning announced the payment, as well as free meals for workers who put their hands up to work overnight from July until the end of the year, as part of a $353m package. He says the initiatives represents a “modest but meaningful way to support and retain healthcare workers within the public system”. This is all about encouraging people to take up a few extra shifts if they can, to go from being part time to maybe working some further hours. It’s an investment in making sure that we can get through this most challenging time, winter, but winter during a pandemic. To be eligible for the full $3,000, workers need to be employed by a public health service by 1 July and still be employed on 30 September. The payments will be made in two rounds, one after 15 August and one after 30 September. Those who start between 1 July and 30 September will be eligible for a pro-rata payment. Earlier this week the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced a similar $3,000 “appreciation payment” for health workers. The Northern Territory government will lift the Covid vaccine mandate for workers on 16 June. Some Covid rules will remain in place, including isolation of close contacts to positive cases, mask wearing in certain locations and the mandatory reporting of positive rapid antigen tests. Bill Shorten will appear on Insiders this weekend to discuss how to tackle ‘big lettuce’. Kidding. Shorten is serving as minister for government services and minister for the NDIS, so it will be interesting to hear what he has to say about the resignation this week of NDIS chief executive Martin Hoffman. Victorian hospital and ambulance workers to receive one-off payments Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, is following NSW in offering one-off payments to all staff in public hospitals and ambulance services. The $353m package includes free meals for nightshift workers until the end of the year. The first $1,500 payment will be made in mid-August and the second at the end of September. NSW police have officially confirmed the good news that Christopher Wilson has been found. How to deal with mould when renting A very important conversation in my household is how to deal with mould. To open the windows? To turn on the fan? To dehumidify each room to within an inch of its life? Just the other week I found myself knee deep in literature, manually wiping down each of my mould-laden books with eucalyptus spray. Tenants in Sydney have been told by their real estate agency it is “critical” they regularly open windows during winter to restrict the spread of mould, with an agency advising tenants management of mould was their responsibility. Read the story from Stephanie Tran and Cait Kelly here: Missing Sydney boy found It is being reported 11-year-old boy Christopher Wilson who was reported missing in Sydney’s north-west has been found safe and well. Wilson got off a school bus at Annangrove about 3pm yesterday to go home but failed to arrive. A police spokesperson said officers were waiting at the scene and an update on the boy’s status would be provided imminently but they have not released a statement at this time. Lettuce prices could ease from next week, producer says The days of lettuce puns may soon be behind us. One of Australia’s big lettuce producers expects prices for the in-demand vegetable to ease from next week, AAP reports. The chief executive of vegetable producer and supplier Fresh Select, John Said, said the recent heavy rains have had a huge impact on the market: We’ve had two floods. The first one a while ago has saturated our soils and made it very hard for us to plant … A second flood not long ago completely wiped out all the crops we had in the ground. Said said replanting is causing a massive supply gap, with the only lettuce harvestable being the ones that survived the floods. We’re seeing these price hikes because of supply pressure. The farmer has been surprised by the high prices being fetched, with a box of 12 lettuces selling to retailers for up to $100. In some supermarkets lettuces are costing between $10 and $12 each, with some shelves cleared of lettuce entirely. The Victorian producer hoped drier weather will see the supply boosted. Clearly there are just not enough lettuce around, hopefully we will see some reprieve next week. But the peak body for Australian vegetable growers, AusVeg, is warning consumers that prices are likely to remain high because of production pressures and poor weather. “Cost of production pressures have been upon us for 12 or 18 months – it’s been on the increase for some time,” AusVeg’s national public affairs manager, Tyson Cattle, said. Cattle warned consumers that prices are likely to stay high while the cost of production issues continue. New study suggests some breast cancer treatments may have been unnecessary When Jenny* had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer, she believed the major surgery to remove her breast, although traumatic, had saved her life. She described feeling “rage” when at a follow-up appointment three years later, she said to her surgeon, “I would probably be dead by now” if she had not received the surgery, to which he replied: “Probably not.” It was only then, after she had already undergone invasive and life-changing treatment, that Jenny learned about “overdiagnosis”. While breast cancer screening programs are essential and save lives, sometimes they also detect lumps that may never go on to cause harm in a woman’s lifetime, leading to overtreatment, and psychological and financial suffering. Man dies in vehicle collision in Melbourne’s west Detectives are investigating a collision in Sunshine West in Melbourne early this morning that claimed the life of a 69-year-old man. Police allege a white Audi sedan was travelling north along Links Road when it collided with a gold Honda sedan travelling east on Glengala Road just before 1am. Both vehicles then crashed into two parked cars on Links Road. The driver of the Honda, a 69-year-old Sunshine West man and sole occupant, died at the scene. Police have been told a number of occupants were inside the Audi at the time of the collision and they were seen running from the scene. One of the occupants, a 22-year-old Wyndham woman, is currently assisting police with their enquiries. NSW daily Covid death toll today includes some from May To clarify, the daily Covid toll in NSW includes 15 deaths that didn’t occur in the latest 24 hour reporting period and date back to mid-May. NSW Health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 8,201 new cases reported and 21 further deaths. There are 1,263 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 40 people in ICU. Victoria’s department of health has released today’s Covid update. There have been 8,903 new cases reported and 22 further deaths. There are 517 people being treated in hospital with the virus including 29 people in ICU. * An earlier version of this post incorrectly listed Victoria as having 5,911 new cases. Blackstone given green light to take over Crown Casino Blackstone has been given the signoff from Victoria’s gambling and casino regulator to take over Crown Casino, with extra conditions in place including a majority independent board of directors, additional auditing requirements and improved information sharing. Negotiations continuing with men in Gold Coast seige, police say Queensland police have been providing an update on the Gold Coast siege. Chris Ahearn, regional crime coordinator for the south-east region said negotiations had continued with two people overnight, who were in police pursuit in relation to return to prison warrants. Shortly after 3pm yesterday afternoon an emergency situation was declared ... in Nerang. As a result of police attending a residence in that location and attempting to engage with two people at that location who police want in relation to some return-to-prison warrants, a standoff had subsequently ensued and a siege has gone on overnight at that location with restrictions in the area and specialist police on site ... negotiations with these occupants of this residence have been under way overnight. What we’d ask is that members of the public avoid that area ... and we ask that any residents within that exclusion zone remain indoors until we resolve this situation. Police are certainly still on the scene there and negotiations are continuing. We are acutely aware of the impact on the local community in that area, with having a situation like this unfolding ... but it’s our intention to resolve it as soon as we can. Anthony Albanese confirms he will live at the Lodge in Canberra The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has done a round of FM interviews mainly talking about how he has hit the ground running, including attending the Quad meeting within hours of being sworn in and his recent trip to Indonesia. On KIIS FM Albanese confirmed he will live at the Lodge in Canberra primarily, but stay at Kirribilli House when he is in Sydney. He knocked back Kyle’s suggestion he put Kirribilli on Airbnb in the meantime, because the AFP probably wouldn’t like that. Albanese spoke about the Chinese fighter jet intercepting Australia’s surveillance flight in the South China Sea. He explained Australia had to stand up for its interests in making a formal complaint about the dangerous incident, because Australia was in international airspace. Jackie O claimed that it was a KIIS producer who kept interjecting during Albanese’s victory speech, but the prime minister said it “added a bit of colour” and he didn’t mind. On WSFM, Albanese spoke about his bamboo bike ride with Joko Widodo. He said: The bamboo bike is probably in customs somewhere, we brought it back on the plane. It was a really nice warm gesture from the [Indonesian] president to go on a bike ride where we had our one on one discussion before we sat down ... For him, it was of great significance, it symbolised both of our humble beginnings, given the positions we now hold. Albanese said Australia’s ambassador had checked if he could ride a bike, and he said yes, because his family didn’t have a car growing up and he only learned to drive in his mid-20s. Albanese: It was good fun although I must say we went really slow at the beginning and I said to the president ‘can we maybe speed up a bit?’ It’s really hard to ride a bike at 1km/h. OECD Economics forecasts Australia’s growth will slow in 2023 Australia is one of the few countries to avoid a downgrade. Gold Coast standoff involves man subject to return-to-prison warrant, police say Here’s the latest on the Queensland siege from AAP. Queensland police are negotiating with two men who have been holed up in a Gold Coast home for more than 16 hours. It is unclear if the pair are armed but parts of Nerang bounded by Riverpark Drive, McLaren Road, Kowhai Place and Inverness Street are locked down on Thursday morning. Paramedics are on standby at the scene and the nearby St Brigid’s primary school will remain shut. The siege began when police arrived in the area to arrest one of the men, who they say is subject to a return-to-prison warrant for allegedly breaching bail conditions. It is believed that man is a high-risk violent offender and connected to two shootings on the Gold Coast in recent days. In one of those incidents a gun was fired at a family’s car as they drove home from dinner in nearby Coolangatta on Saturday night. The bullet shattered the car’s window and was millimetres from directly hitting a 55-year-old man in the front passenger seat. He was treated for a graze to his neck, while his wife and son were not physically harmed. In the early hours of Monday morning multiple shots were fired from a car near the Arundal police beat. No one was injured in the drive-by attack but the bullets hit the building and a police car parked outside. Police are expected to speak about the siege later this morning. Spirit of cooperation among energy ministers, Chris Bowen says The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been doing the rounds this morning. He also appeared on the Today Show and Sunrise following the first cabinet meeting with state and territory ministers to discuss rising energy prices. He told Today ministers took “steps forward” yesterday, some with quick implementation times and some longer-term plans. I think Australians understand that you don’t undo nine years of policy chaos in one meeting, but Labor, Liberal and Green energy ministers from across the country came together very cooperatively with me in a two-hour meeting. We’ll be quick to implement ... giving Aemo, the energy market operator, the power to buy gas and store it so it can help us through the current crisis into the more immediate future. But we also agreed on plans it will take longer to work through like a national integrated agreement to have all the investments that are needed for the transition to renewables across the board Look, there was a real spirit of cooperation. I think Australians around the country appreciate honesty. There’s no easy answer. I can be honest with them saying state and territory ministers are working really well with the new government. “Thanks minister,” the interview concluded, “he sounds cold doesn’t he?” Bill Shorten has weighed in on the lettuce shortage ... and associated bad puns If you missed this 2016 incident in which Shorten famously asked a shopper what her favourite kind of lettuce was in a truly bizarre supermarket stunt, you’re in for a treat: On the Gold Coast, a standoff between two men and police continues this morning more than 14 hours after it began. An exclusion zone remains in place in the suburb of Nerang following the issuing of an emergency declaration yesterday evening. At 8.30am local time, Queensland police acting superintendent Chris Ahearn will provide an update on the ongoing situation. The exclusion zone encompasses Riverpark Drive, McLaren Road, Kopwhai Place and Inverness Street. Members of the public have been advised to avoid the area and those within the exclusion zone have been asked to remain indoors until further notice. Capacity mechanism is a priority to bring on renewables, energy ministers say The first meeting of energy ministers yesterday evening indicated there will be a new intensity in federal-state-territory coordination. As we detailed here, there are 11 agreements although they will mostly take time to have some effect: Of note from the communique of the meeting was an indication that any plan to build extra capacity of dispatchable electricity is not intended to keep gas and coal in the system. “Energy ministers agreed to advance the work on a capacity mechanism as a priority to bring on renewables and storage to support stability for the national energy market.” Still, the design will be critical, and this “capacity mechanism” will be a fault line of sorts for the energy debate, possibly for years to come. In the meantime, it’s the case of another day and another power price spike, with the highest spot prices this morning in New South Wales. There was another brief “lack of reserve” notice in NSW, since cancelled, but an indication that the market remains tight. And if you would like a tour of the energy landscape, listen in to this Full Story podcast: Independent MP Allegra Spender appeared on the Today Show this morning. Asked what she wanted to see to address the energy crisis, with people “freezing in their homes,” she replied: In a country of Australia ... we have the energy in this country, it is absolutely tragic that people are in that situation. I think that the government can do more and what we’re looking at right now is a crisis in fossil fuel prices – you’re seeing gas prices and coal prices across the world spiking because of the war in the Ukraine. We produce gas and coal, we export that hugely, we need to make sure that Australian consumers are protected from those international price increases that are driven by international circumstances ... Exactly what the government should be doing is working with the gas companies and saying ‘guys, you know people – Australians, families and businesses expect to be able to access affordable energy, you’re making great profits, you’re not paying a lot of corporate tax on the east coast and you’re making great profits because of this spike in prices, you need to come to the party and make sure that Australian consumers and businesses are protected’. Bowen welcomes work on reopening coal-fired plants Bowen also sidestepped confirmations of whether more coal-fired plants would be fired up to open up energy capacity. Government will decide if coal and gas are included – Bowen The energy security board is set to draft its paper in the coming days. But Bowen says the ultimate decision as to whether its recommendations are accepted will be up to the government. Gas will play role in renewable energy transition – Bowen Bowen is asked whether gas will play a role in Australia’s transition to renewable energy. He says he’s said “consistently” that gas has a role to play. There’s been ideology on both sides of this debate, we’ve had the previous government say there is a gas fired recovery, that is a fraud ... we need gas to stabilise while we are building the [renewable] storage and transmission ... we don’t have that infrastructure at the moment. One of the benefits of gas is gas-fired power stations unlike coal-fired power stations can be turned on and off very quickly ... that’s why gas will play a role. Energy retailers support capacity mechanism, Bowen says Bowen is asked whether the retailers accept the government’s agreements to a capacity mechanism which ensures power plants are available to generate electricity when needed. He says he’s done “little else” than talk to retailers in the past week. I’ve been in constant contact with the retailers ... I’ve done little else, and there is support for the capacity mechanism ... we’ll work for a sensible outcome, perhaps not everyone will be happy with the outcome but there’s recognition we need something like this. This is primarily a coal-fired power crisis ... obviously there’s a lot of issues here but at its core this has been led by outages in coal stations. Chris Bowen says Aemo’s new powers will have quickest effect on energy prices The energy minister, Chris Bowen, is appearing on Radio National. Asked if the 11-point plan agreed to by ministers yesterday would have any meaningful short-term effect on energy prices, he replied: It is a big step forward, some of the steps will apply very quickly and others are an agreement to work in the medium term. There was a real spirit of cooperation around the room ... we all agreed we’re in this task together. Bowen said new powers given to energy regulator Aemo would be the quickest to take effect, while new investments in renewables would also be crucial to provide extra capacity. 11-year-old boy reported missing in Sydney’s north-west Fears are held for an 11-year-old boy who’s gone missing in Sydney’s north-west after temperatures plummeted to four degrees overnight, AAP reports. Christopher Wilson got off a school bus on Annangrove Road, Annangrove, about 3pm on Wednesday to go home but failed to arrive, New South Wales police said. He was wearing his school uniform – a blue T-shirt with maroon and white trim, grey shorts, and red and black shoes. He was spotted walking along Annangrove Road towards Rouse Hill about 4.45pm, wearing a black and white jacket and carrying a black backpack. A search of the area overnight by local police, PolAir, Police Rescue and 15 members of the SES was unsuccessful and will resume on Thursday morning. Police are concerned for Christopher’s welfare due to his age and because temperatures dropped to just four degrees overnight. He is described as being of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander appearance, about 120cm tall, of slim build, with short brown hair and brown eyes. New European ambassador to Australia announced The EU special envoy for the Indo-Pacific, Gabriele Visentin, has been announced as the next European ambassador in Australia. Australian federal and state governments have reached 11 agreements including prioritising a move to renewable energy following the first meeting of energy ministers to address rising prices hitting the nation. They include setting up a new gas storage reserve, proceeding with plans to build up spare electricity capacity and developing a national transition plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been instructed to procure and store gas supplies while regulators will be given more powers to ensure transparency in the sector. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the crisis meeting was constructive, with “steps forward” taken but “no easy fixes” to lowering energy prices. It comes as the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is poised to hold a cabinet meeting today, considering how best to respond to the cost-of-living crisis facing Australians. All of the big four banks have passed on the Reserve Bank’s official cash rate hike to mortgage holders. And the federal government has confirmed a transition in employment services will continue next month as planned. Workforce Australia will replace the job active network for jobseeker recipients, while an “onerous” points-based system will also be rolled out for recipients to maintain their payments.

Electricity generation in 2018 was the lowest since 1994, when Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour party. The reduced need for power came despite there being 8 million more people living in the UK. Analysts said the figures were a sign of increasingly efficient use of energy and the country’s changing economy. The UK website Carbon Brief, which analysed government and industry data, found that 335 terawatt-hours were generated by power plants last year, down by about 1% on the year before. Since 2005 the level has fallen by 16% – or the equivalent of two and a half Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations. Simon Evans, policy editor at the group, said: “It could be a combination of more efficient appliances, energy-saving lightbulbs and, more recently, LEDs. Then there’s supermarkets installing better fridges, industry using more efficient pumps. Across all of those businesses, efficiency will have been going up. And of course there’s the changing nature of industry in the UK.” The financial crisis could also have played a role in making homes and businesses more careful with their energy use, he added. While generation fell almost every year between 2008 and 2014, it remained stable between 2015 and 2017, before resuming its downward march in 2018. Previous research by the government’s climate change advisers has found that more energy efficient appliances helped save the average household £290 a year between 2008 and 2017. Continuing to use energy more efficiently would help the UK reach its binding climate goals, Evans said. “Using less as an end in itself isn’t the point. But it is the case that meeting carbon targets is made easier if we use energy efficiently.” Separate data from the National Grid showed that 2018 was the greenest year to date for electricity generation as more power is sourced from renewable sources and less from coal. The carbon intensity from electricity generation was down 6.8% last year and has more than halved since 2013. The analysis by Carbon Brief found that renewable sources including biomass, hydro, solar and wind power supplied a record 33% of electricity this year, up from 29% last year. Renewables were just 6.7% of the mix in 2009. Green energy was boosted primarily by new windfarms connecting to the grid, as well as new biomass plants, which included the conversion of a coal unit at Drax power station in north Yorkshire and the conversion of a former coal plant at Lynemouth, Northumberland. Meanwhile the coal-driven output was down 25% despite warnings of a coal comeback driven by high gas prices. Nuclear power also had a weak year, with generation down 8%, mainly due to ageing reactors being taken offline for safety checks. Gas remained the top source of electricity supplies, but fell 4%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2019/apr/05/arctic-double-polar-expedition-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-05T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Arctic: a Double Polar Expedition - photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/05/arctic-double-polar-expedition-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/05/arctic-double-polar-expedition-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"Arctic: a Double Polar Expedition - photo essay","bodyText":"From Russia to Norway, Greenland, Canada and Alaska, Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen have explored many of the key issues affecting the Arctic – from the opening of new trade routes to the militarisation of borders, the search for mineral resources and polar tourism – and their impact on local communities. Underpinning it all is the slow but constant melting of the polar sea ice. Yuri Kozyrev travelled the route of the Arctic’s Russian maritime ports. He accompanied the last remaining nomadic people of the region, the Nenets, during their seasonal reindeer migration. Yuri followed the coast of the Barents Sea, and travelled aboard the Monchegorsk container ship. He encountered people who had been made ill by nickel mining in Norilsk, and travelled to Murmansk, where the first floating nuclear power plant is under construction. Kadir van Lohuizen began his journey in the Svalbard archipelago, following the Northwest Passage, now the shortest route between Europe and Asia because of the melting ice. Off the coast of Canada, he lived in the small community of Resolute, recently host to a training facility for the Canadian Army following the expansion of openings in the Arctic ice. Finally, he travelled to Kivalina, an indigenous village in northern Alaska, which could be under water by 2025. “The melting of the polar sea ice is changing the map of the world for ever. By visiting all the affected regions and countries in one expedition and by showing how the different parties – starting with Russia and the US – are working to conquer the north pole, we will reveal how the impact of climate change in the Arctic is of global significance for the rest of the world.” Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen The Yamal Peninsula, Russia The Serotetto nomadic herding family move their reindeer northward from winter pastures to summer pastures. ©Yuri Kozyrev In western Siberia, the Yamal Peninsula is home to nomadic Nenets reindeer herders. In Nenets language, yamal means “end of the world”. The Nenets migrate annually with their herds, which range from 50 to 7,000 reindeer. The migration pattern depends on seasons and on the continuity of lichen pastures. For the first time, the Serotetto family could not finish their transhumance this year because of the permafrost melting. The Nenets people building chums, conical-shaped tents made of reindeer skins laid over a skeleton of long wooden poles. “I have always been deeply fascinated by the Arctic. My father, a Soviet helicopter pilot, flew civilian sorties to the region over a period of five years, supplying scientific and meteorological bases there. It was during one such mission, in 1969, that he died in the Arctic, when I was only six. Ever since I was a child I have felt drawn to the region, not because it took my father’s life but because his work there is a telling example of the great importance Soviet authorities gave to the colonisation of the Arctic.” Yuri Kozyrev The Yamal LNG plant and the Sabetta sea port on the Yamal Peninsula. The Novoportovskoye is one of the biggest oil fields in the peninsula. Oil was first discovered here in the 1960s, although development only began in 2011. It lies 30km from the Ob Bay coast. Gazprom Neft operates the Novy port project, which is built to deliver up to eight million tons of oil per year. Cape Kamenny, Yamal Peninsula, Russia, May 2018. Every other day on average, the icebreaker Baltika supports the mooring and loading operations of tankers at Gazprom Neft’s “Arctic Gate” terminal in the Gulf of Ob. The terminal was built 700km away from the existing pipeline infrastructure, so Yamal gas, oil and condensates are being shipped by sea for the first time in the history of Russia’s energy industry. Resolute Bay, Canada Operation Nunalivut is conducted every year in Canada’s high Arctic. ©Kadir van Lohuizen The Canadian army is increasing its presence in the high Canadian Arctic. Operation Nunalivut involves patrolling the high Arctic, learning about winter survival and training with the Canadian Ranger Patrol Group, an Inuit unit. An attempt to start up the snow scooters at extreme temperatures is an effort; fuel pumps often freeze. The Canadian Rangers train the soldiers to operate and survive in harsh conditions, with temperatures as low as -45C. Soldiers have to start up their snow scooters indoors, as fuel pumps often freeze. Point Hope, Alaska Ben Lane Jr, a young whale hunter, takes a nap when the rest of the crew is on watch to spot Bowhead whales. ©Kadir van Lohuizen The Inuit community of Point Hope is allowed to catch 10 bowhead whales per year. Native communities are allowed to hunt whales for their own use. The quota is determined by the International Whaling Commission. The early disappearance of the sea ice has made it much harder for the community to catch whales, which threatens their livelihood. Steve Oomittuk, a whaling captain, celebrates his birthday. Normally, hunting starts when the sea ice starts to break in the spring. As the whales migrate up north, they use the channels to come up for breathing. If there is no ice, they spread out over a wider area and are much more difficult to track. Svalbard and Spitsbergen A weather balloon is launched twice a day to the upper atmosphere to take measurements used by global weather stations. ©Kadir van Lohuizen There are many research facilities on Svalbard run by agencies from 10 countries, largely centred around environmental and earth sciences. There is a seed bank where millions of species of seeds are stored to insure against the loss of seeds in other gene banks during large-scale regional or global crises. Longyearbyen, Svalbard Islands, Norway, July 2018. The archipelago and its main island, Spitzbergen, are under Norwegian sovereignty. Their population of 2,500 more than doubles when a 300-metre cruise ship like the Mein Schiff 3 (My Ship 3) drops off its 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members. Although Svalbard is under Norwegian sovereignty, the Svalbard Treaty of 1920 allows for commercial activity of signatories, and Russia and Norway have mining operations on Svalbard as a result. The Norwegian coastguard, part of the navy, patrols the Isfjorden. Coast guards from the Norwegian army patrol the Isfjorden, where most of the largest settlements of Svalbard are located. The coastguard is not allowed to be based on Svalbard, but operates from Norway. Murmansk, Russia Cadets attend the Nakhimov naval school. ©Yuri Kozyrev Nakhimov naval school in Murmansk is a Russian government-funded initiative to promote patriotic education among a new generation of Russians. Under President Vladimir Putin, nine presidential Cadet and Nakhimov schools have been established countrywide over the last five years. The floating nuclear power plant Akademik Lomonosov, the first of its kind. The Akademik Lomonosov, a floating nuclear power plant, is made of two miniature naval propulsion reactors, and its reactors will generate 70 megawatts of electricity when it comes online to take over from the nearby Bilibino nuclear power plant. In spring 2018, it was towed out of Saint Petersburg shipyard to Murmansk, where its nuclear reactors have been fuelled. It is scheduled to be towed to the port of Pevek, in Russia’s far northeastern region of Chukotka, in summer 2019. On board the Monchegorskin the Kara Sea, August 2018 on the way to Murmansk.

Hudson Bay, Canada Sea ice on the Hudson Bay close to Rankin Inlet. ©Kadir van Lohuizen The Canadian Arctic is immense and remote. There are no deep sea ports and hardly any roads, and Canada has few icebreakers operating. Flights are incredibly expensive due to monopolies and few passengers. The search for mineral and fossil resources is at an all-time high. Diamonds, gold, zinc, tin, copper, oil and gas are all seemingly ready to be mined. The melting of the sea ice and permafrost makes mining easier. “For a number of years I have been working on large- scale projects about migration, mineral resources and last but not least, climate change. Being from the Netherlands, a country where we live for the most part below sea level, I gained an interest in the issues surrounding rising sea levels” Kadir van Lohuizen Greenland The edge of the ice sheet close to Kangerlussuaq and the rivers of meltwater. ©Kadir van Lohuizen Climate change is making the ice sheet slowly melt, and glaciers are retreating rapidly, forming melting streams, reservoirs and underground rivers.

In the EastGRIP (East Greenland Ice-core Project) science camp, at an altitude of 3,000 metres, international scientists drill through the 2,550-metre-thick ice sheet to reach the bedrock and study ice streams. These frozen rivers cause the ice sheet to move 15cm a day toward the ocean, a phenomenon that contributes to the rising of the oceans.

This hole is the result of thermokarst, a phenomenon caused by the permafrost melting, which provokes soil compaction and ground collapses and has been happening since the 1960s. The soil around the crater’s edge may hold thousands of years of biological and geological history.

Palmer’s Queensland Nickel refinery owed about $300m to creditors, including local businesses and the federal government, when it collapsed in 2016. The government covered the entitlements of many workers, but it is estimated workers are still owed about $7m. Palmer declared last month that he would put aside $7m in a fund for workers who lost their jobs in 2016 after the collapse of the Queensland Nickel refinery. Guardian Australia reported this week that the former employees are being told to sign a document gagging them from making any disparaging comments about Palmer in exchange for receiving the outstanding entitlements. In 2016, the federal government said it would appoint a special purpose liquidator to maximise the return to the taxpayer. The then employment minister Michaelia Cash said the government would “use every power at its disposal to ensure the corporate dealings of this joint venture arrangement are thoroughly investigated and responsible company officers are held to account”. On Thursday Burston told Guardian Australia that if Palmer was elected he would not seek to influence the liquidator. “It’ll be resolved probably in July [but] I put a lot of conditions on going over to him, his name isn’t on any of the policies the party releases and not doing any favours in terms of his business in parliament,” he told Guardian Australia. “I would regard such things as a conflict of interest and that’s something you just can’t do, that’s corruption in my view, it’s corrupt conduct and it won’t happen. “I’ll still be the leader in the Senate and I assure you his business interests will not play a part in decisions we make – I guarantee it – I will not be a party to it ever and if I break that you can hammer me.” Palmer and his rebadged political party have emerged on the Australian political landscape in the lead up to Saturday’s election by reportedly stumping up upwards of $60m on a relentless, near-omnipresent advertising spend. The campaign has been dogged by a string of bizarre revelations. Candidates signed contracts requiring them to return $400,000 in election support if they win a seat but subsequently leave the party and read from scripted word-for-word videos decrying the foreign ownership of Australian ports. The band Twisted Sister is suing Palmer over his use of the band’s hit song We’re Not Gonna Take It, while the man himself spent the last week of the campaign holidaying in Fiji. But what does Palmer actually want? Other than a few 15-second advertisements and detail-light speeches, the mining billionaire, occasional Titanic II enthusiast and reported ower of about $7m in unpaid entitlements to workers from his collapsed Queensland Nickel refinery has offered little insight into what he would do if he were returned to parliament after Saturday. The policy section of the UAP’s website runs to 177 words, and includes vague commitments such as “a strong position on paid political lobbyists, saving tax payers dollars and introducing fair policies”. The party has also said it wants to introduce a $150 a week increase in the age pension, promised “fast trains” to capital cities within one hour from 300km away, and says it wants Australia to begin generating nuclear power. How it would fund such commitments is unclear, and emails and calls to the party have gone unanswered this week. But Burston, who defected to the UAP after falling out with the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, admitted the party would “have a bit to do” in planning how to introduce its commitments if it was in a position to enact them. He said the party’s push for nuclear energy would see “about eight to 10” nuclear power stations built down the east coast of Australia run by “probably both” the government and private companies. In the meantime, he said he would support a government underwriting a new coal-fired power station “if we can’t get the private sector to fund it”. On lobbying, Burston said he wanted to see a ban on ex-politicians acting as lobbyists and thought a national integrity commission or federal Icac was “perhaps not a bad idea”. Such a ban, he said, could potentially extend to former political advisers too, though “how far down the line you go with that will have to be looked at”. So too would the role in-house lobbyists, who largely operate without scrutiny or transparency in federal parliament and are not on the lobbyist register. “I haven’t really thought about that,” he said. On refugee policy the UAP’s website says it would revise current policy to “ensure Australia is protected and refugees are given opportunities for a better future and lifestyle”. In his maiden speech in 2016 Burston said Australia was being “swamped” by immigrants, that multiculturalism creates an “ethnic hierarchy” and that Australia should “discriminate by cultural and religious identity in selecting migrants and refugees”. On Thursday he told Guardian Australia his views on immigration had “mellowed” since leaving One Nation in June last year, and that he no longer believed migration policy should be discriminatory. However, he stood by his characterisation of the country being “swamped” by migrants, and said the country should have a zero net migration policy “until our infrastructure catches up”. However, he said he supported the party’s push for onshore refugee processing, saying claims would be decided “within a week” under a UAP government. On the pension increase, Burston said he wasn’t sure how much the commitment would cost the budget, but admitted it would be “phased in” across the forward estimates. He said he also supported lowering the retirement age back to 60. “It’ll be a considerable [cost] but I think the welfare and health of our aged pensioners who have contributed all their life are entitled to an income that lifts them out of poverty. I don’t care really what it costs and I think a lot of people in Australia would be happy to see something like it happen,” he said. Under a so-called zonal tax plan put forward by the UAP, communities living 200km away from a capital city will pay 20% less tax than the cities. The party says the policy would encourage decentralisation. Burston said it would in fact be a rebate because a preferential tax system “is not constitutional” but said the cost of the policy could be offset by other areas including foreign aid. “There would be some impost on the budget but it would also stimulate regional areas and that cost can be adjusted in different areas to balance out, for example foreign aid where we’re spending billions,” he said. “I’m not suggesting that’s what will be done but if you’re going to stimulate regional areas and not let them die as they are dying then you have to do something.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-28T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Pinker’s progress: the celebrity scientist at the centre of the culture wars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars","fields":{"headline":"Pinker’s progress: the celebrity scientist at the centre of the culture wars","bodyText":"On a recent afternoon, Steven Pinker, the cognitive psychologist and bestselling author of upbeat books about human progress, was sitting in his summer home on Cape Cod, thinking about Bill Gates. Pinker was gearing up to record a radio series on critical thinking for the BBC, and he wanted the world’s fourth richest man to join him for an episode on the climate emergency. “People tend to approach challenges in one of two ways – as problem-solving or as conflict,” Pinker, who appreciates the force of a tidy dichotomy, said. “You can think of it as Bill versus Greta. And I’m very much in Bill’s camp.” A few weeks earlier, Gates had been photographed in Manhattan carrying a copy of Pinker’s soon to be published 12th book, Rationality, which inspired the BBC series. “We sent it to his people,” Pinker said. Pinker is an avid promoter of his own work, and for the past 25 years he has had a great deal to promote. Since the 1990s, he has written a string of popular books on language, the mind and human behaviour, but in the past decade, he has become best known for his counterintuitive take on the state of the world. In the shadow of the financial crisis, while other authors were writing books about how society was profoundly broken, Pinker took the opposite tack, arguing that things were, in fact, better than ever. In The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, he gathered copious amounts of data to show that violence had declined across human history, in large part because of the emergence of markets and states. Understandably, the book struck a chord with people who move markets and run states. Gates called it “the most inspiring book I’ve ever read”, and Mark Zuckerberg included it on a list of what to read at Davos. Then, in 2018, at the height of Donald Trump’s presidency and amid the accelerating climate crisis, Pinker published a follow-up, Enlightenment Now, which expanded his argument. It wasn’t just that life had become less violent; thanks to the application of science and reason since the 18th century, the human condition had dramatically improved in health, wealth and liberty, too. Bill Clinton had Enlightenment Now on his bedside table, and Gates declared it his “new favourite book of all time”. “Bill’s got a pretty nimble mind, so I think he can riff on anything,” Pinker said, imagining how Gates would fare on the radio show. He was looking out over Cape Cod Bay from the upper deck of his house, which he shares with his wife, the philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. From the bottom deck, a staircase of more than 100 steps runs down to a beach, like one of Pinker’s trademark graphs depicting the decline in some measure of human misery. Pinker sees the world in broadly utilitarian terms. “A quantitative mindset, despite its nerdy aura, is in fact the morally enlightened one,” he writes in Enlightenment Now. On this basis, he has ranked Gates, who has spent roughly $50bn on philanthropy, near the top of a moral hierarchy crowned by people such as Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Peace prize-winning agronomist credited with saving more than a billion lives through his innovations in agriculture. Pinker’s positive spin on the world has brought him into the orbit of many powerful people. On his phone, under the heading Politicians, he keeps a list of the two dozen or so heads of state, royalty and other leaders who have asked him for an audience. They include the prime minister of his native Canada, Justin Trudeau (“That was the greatest thrill for a Canadian boy”) and Mauricio Macri, then the president of Argentina (“I got to stand on the Evita balcony”). In 2016, Pinker co-authored an article for the New York Times with Colombia’s then-president, Juan Manuel Santos, two months before Santos won the Nobel Peace prize for helping to end the country’s 50-year-long guerrilla war. He has twice been a guest at Bohemian Grove, which has been described as an off-the-record summer camp for male members of the American establishment. He told me he had met some amazing people there, like Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, the former secretaries of state to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, respectively. He seemed to enjoy both the absurdity of the experience and its purpose – to bring powerful people into contact with one another. Pinker says he offers these global leaders “an infusion of ideas – or even just enthusiasm for good, old-fashioned liberal democracy”. That means “a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market freedom, social spending and judicious regulation,” as he put it in Enlightenment Now, all held together by a state strong enough to keep people from each other’s throats. He believes the balance of these elements should be cautiously tweaked and twiddled through experimentation and empirical feedback. In the case of the western world, this roughly translates to the view that things are pretty good, which isn’t to say they couldn’t be better, and although there are threats to face, we shouldn’t burn the system down, because things could certainly be a whole lot worse, and if we can make incremental improvements, then a rising tide will lift all boats. It’s a position that Gates, in a conversation with Pinker and the New York Times, called the “conservative centre”. In the eyes of his critics, this stance has made Pinker the world’s most prominent defender of the status quo. At a time of rising inequality and ecological catastrophe, his prescription for the world – do basically the same thing we have been doing, just a bit better – can seem perverse. To less optimistic observers, the existence of billionaires such as Gates – he and seven other men own as much wealth as the planet’s poorest 3.5 billion people, according to a recent Oxfam estimate – indicates a profound rot in the current arrangements of civilisation. The writer Pankaj Mishra has called Pinker a member of the “intellectual service class”, which shuffles about justifying the positions and soothing the moral sensitivities of society’s winners. Nicolas Guilhot, a professor of intellectual history at the European University Institute, believes that Pinker is fighting a somewhat desperate rearguard action on behalf of neoliberalism against an encroaching army of detractors across the political spectrum. Pinker’s books, and their support from the likes of Zuckerberg, Clinton and Gates, are a reaction, Guilhot told me, “from people who are aware that they’ve lost a lot of ground”. * * * Despite his preference for problem-solvers over conflict-mongers, a strong case can be made that Pinker belongs in that second camp. “Sometimes to my own retroactive surprise, I seem to have a taste for controversy,” he recently told Steven Levitt, the economist and author of Freakonomics. A search for Pinker’s byline on the newspaper archive site Nexis returns 191 articles since 1994, with headlines that reflect the breadth of his interests, as well as an inclination to provoke: Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man?, Sniffing Out the Gay Gene, Nuclear Power Can Save the World, The Enlightenment Is Working. Over the course of his career, the subjects of his major books have expanded from language to the mind, and from human behaviour to the sweep of history. Each new topic has taken him further from the fields in which he did original research, and each new book has seemed more eager than the last to start a row. In recent years, Pinker has carved out a niche for himself as a pundit who brings social science to the culture wars. He comes to these conflicts armed with the rhetorical skills of the debate champion and the visual aids of a management consultant. By some metrics, it is a winning strategy. He makes liberal use of graphs and charts in his recent books – there are about 180 in Better Angels and Enlightenment Now – and helped to create Google Books’s ngram viewer, which plots the frequency of words and phrases in the English corpus, among other languages. His own ngram results put him below Richard Dawkins and Noam Chomsky, two of his major intellectual influences, but above Yuval Noah Harari and Jordan Peterson, to whom he has been compared. (Google Trends, which tracks more demotic kinds of interest, in the form of search queries, puts Peterson on top by a significant margin.) As a young scholar in the 80s, Pinker was distinguished more for his insights into language acquisition and visual cognition than for his willingness to plunge into acrimonious debates over gender, race and progress. His life in the public eye began in the early 90s, when an editor at a scholarly journal told him he wrote stylishly, and suggested he try doing it for a broader audience. Not long afterwards, he spoke to the philosopher Daniel Dennett, who had recently made the leap from academic to mainstream writing. “Within 40 seconds of hanging up with Dan, the phone rang and it was his literary agent, John Brockman, on the line,” Pinker told an interviewer in 2001. The initial outcome was The Language Instinct, a wide-ranging account of the nature of language, published in 1994, which combined easy-to-follow discussions of Chomskian linguistics with evolutionary theory and jokes from Woody Allen. A quarter of a million copies have been sold. When I suggested that he must have been gobsmacked by his sudden transformation from research scientist into public intellectual, Pinker demurred. “I had seen the success of Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, and realised that no one had yet done the same thing for language or cognitive science,” he said. “So I was prepared for it to be popular.” The section of The Language Instinct that garnered the most attention happened to be its most acerbic one, a chapter chiding rule-bound grammar bores. Its popularity seems to have emboldened the contrarian in Pinker. In 1997, he published How the Mind Works, which he framed as a critique of what he called the “standard social science model”, according to which nurture explained almost everything, and nature almost nothing. The next year, Pinker sold out one of London’s largest lecture halls for a debate about the book’s thesis. “Not every academic who has the chance to speak to large audiences enjoys it in the same way,” says Ravi Mirchandani, who was Pinker’s UK publisher in the 90s, and who also published Richard Dawkins at the time. Before the debate, a journalist asked Pinker about his treatment of academic orthodoxies. “I suppose I do line them up and mow them down,” he replied, while mimicking firing a machine gun. By the time of The Blank Slate, which came out in 2002, Pinker was positioning his work as an attack on what he considered the three central dogmas of the “intellectual establishment” in academia and the media – that there is no such thing as human nature, that our minds are somehow separate from our bodies, and that people are born good. By contrast, he held that quite a number of traits are universally human, that the mind is an information processing system running on the unique hardware of the brain, and that, whatever good we’re capable of, the basic condition of humanity, to paraphrase Thomas Hobbes, his favourite political philosopher, is a war of each against all. Those first popular books irked their fair share of reviewers and academics, especially on the left, who feared that Pinker’s debatable scientific interpretations had unsavoury political implications. But the real turning point in his career arrived in 2007, in the form of a simple question: “What are you optimistic about?” The prompt was part of an annual symposium for the website Edge, run by Pinker’s literary agent, Brockman. Pinker’s 678-word answer was that violence had declined across human history, an argument he expanded over the next four years into the 696-page book Better Angels. “A large swathe of our intellectual culture is loth to admit that there could be anything good about civilization, modernity, and western society,” Pinker wrote in the book. Around the same time that he was researching violence, Pinker was beginning to see himself as having a particular role to play in public life – not just as a talented explainer of science, or even a critic of intellectual orthodoxies, but as someone who could stand athwart the stupidification of public discourse. “I came out of the closet as a defender of reason and objectivity,” Pinker told the Times. The major result of this decloseting was Enlightenment Now, which he described to me as his “theory of everything, or almost everything, or at least a lot”. In the book, he argues that, along with liberalism, the Enlightenment gave rise to three main values – reason, science and humanism – that led to the massive improvements he charts in the human condition. These improvements were not only material but moral, as people began to expand their circle of moral concern to those beyond their own family, tribe, nation or species. It was his wife, he said, who convinced him that these values were “worth singling out and defending”. Since Enlightenment Now came out, in early 2018, Pinker has been engaged in almost unceasing conflict with what he considers his many intellectual enemies, who include intellectuals (“intellectuals hate progress”), progressives (“intellectuals who call themselves ‘progressive’ really hate progress”), and universities full of progressive intellectuals (a “suffocating leftwing monoculture”). He has also taken aim at postmodernism (“defiant obscurantism, dogmatic relativism, and suffocating political correctness”), a stretch of the green movement running all the way from Al Gore to the Unabomber (“quasi-religious ideology … laced with misanthropy”), contemporary identity politics (“an enemy of reason and Enlightenment values”), and the many people who “lack the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place or not”. In these conflicts, Pinker sometimes presents himself as the lone contrarian in a sea of irrationality. He has written in the past that arguments that are “completely reasonable to me, yet blazingly controversial to everyone else” are “the story of my life”. * * * This summer, I flew to Provincetown, on Cape Cod’s northern tip, to observe up close the intellectual habits of a man considered by some to be one of the most influential thinkers of our time. I arrived on a warm morning at the start of tourist season, and when Pinker picked me up he had the top down on his Volvo convertible. Provincetown has long been a summer resort, especially for LGBTQ people; it is the sort of liberal idyll – commerce meets individual rights meets cappuccinos – that Pinker extols. Fourth of July celebrations had ended the previous day, and the clothing boutiques and cafes along the main drag were festooned with American flags and pride banners. Men in thongs with tanned pectorals cycled by the waterfront. Pinker recognises the dangers of being trapped within the comfortable perspective of such a comfortable world. The antidote, he says, is an empirical mindset. In Rationality, he notes that in 2019, following the first shark fatality in Massachusetts in 80 years, towns up and down the Cape invested in expensive shark warning and control measures, even though car crashes kill 15 to 20 people there every year, and “cheap improvements in signage, barriers and traffic law enforcement could save many more lives at a fraction of the cost”. That actuarial approach to human life has caused some to think he is bloodless, which he is not. He loves classic rock, says his favourite genre of movie is the concert film or rock documentary, and has watched The Last Waltz, about the largely Canadian band the Band, at least a dozen times. He is a keen landscape and wildlife photographer. “He just takes an infinite delight in the world as it presents itself,” his mother, Roslyn, told me. Pinker began his training as an experimental psychologist in the mid-70s, and spending time with him is a little like auditing Intro Psych, which he has taught every year at Harvard, and before that MIT, for the past 25 years. No matter the topic of conversation, he will reach for a wider theory or study to explain it: the universality of facial expressions, the roots of physical attractiveness, the moral awe people feel for Noam Chomsky, why zebras have stripes. He likes to divide the world into opposing forces or tendencies: he has written that there are two basic intellectual cultures, two fundamental political outlooks, two types of declinism, two flavours of pessimism, two sides to happiness, two ways to get something you want from other people, two ways to appreciate the world’s progress, and two forms of politicisation subverting reason today. When we stopped to order sandwiches at a deli in the small town of Truro, he brought up a study from the 80s that identified two species of vegetarian – those who eschew meat for moral reasons, and those who do it for health. Pinker, who ordered a smoked turkey sandwich with muenster cheese, described himself as a “reducetarian” and reckons that, morally speaking, he probably shouldn’t eat meat. (If he could choose his final meal, he told the aspiring jet-setter’s magazine Monocle, it would be a rib steak, beer and bottle of San Pellegrino at the Brooklyn steakhouse Peter Luger.) We ate our sandwiches on the upper deck of his house. The conversation bounced from his book sales (higher per capita in the UK than in the US) to people’s irrational fears about nuclear energy (“Chernobyl killed about as many people as coal emissions kill every day”) to Woody Allen (“Can you mention Woody Allen these days? I think you can mention Woody Allen. For one thing, he was almost certainly innocent”). Afterwards, Pinker showed me his study, where a large swathe of fabric the colour of snooker baize hung. When the coronavirus pandemic closed the university, he decamped to the Cape, and delivered his lectures for Intro Psych online. “I put my slides behind me on the green screen so I could point at them like a weatherman,” he said. He has described himself as “a modern lecturer-entertainer, with bullet points, borscht belt humour and audiovisual razzle-dazzle”. On a nearby shelf was a small bag filled with fake cockroaches and a curl of plastic dog poo. “For my lecture on disgust,” he said. Pinker is not only a scientific showman; he is also a willing guinea pig. By his own admission, he does not shy away from self-revelation. He has an MRI scan of a sagittal section of his brain on his website, and has had his genome sequenced and posted online, along with his medical history (basal cell skin cancer, 1995; Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 2010; blood type, O+). According to genetic tests published in 2012, he shares significant amounts of DNA with his longtime friend the Harvard law professor and Trump impeachment lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and with the conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks, with whom he also shares significant parts of his worldview. Having toured the house, Pinker and I suited up for a bike ride. “I like to go fast,” he told me. He rides a several-thousand-dollar carbon frame, which he bought secondhand on eBay. For many years, he used to check the weight of everything that went on his bike, including his water bottle. “It was truly obsessive compulsive, because we know that, when it comes to speed, aerodynamics are a far bigger factor than weight,” he said. Before the advent of GPS tracking apps, he used to measure his routes out on a map and record his rides in a journal. He still weighs himself every morning. “We’re a pair of Mamils,” Pinker joked as we cycled out of his garage. “Middle-aged men in Lycra.” I added that we were Weird, too. (The acronym – which stands for western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic – is drawn from the work of Joe Henrich, the chair of evolutionary biology at Harvard, and several of his colleagues. They have criticised behavioural scientists for routinely publishing “broad claims about human psychology and behaviour” based only on samples from Weird societies.) “Right,” Pinker said, before plunging down his steep drive. * * * Later that afternoon, Pinker and I arrived at a pair of graveyards flanking the Truro Meeting House, a converted church where he was due to give a talk on Rationality the following week. In one of the burial grounds was a modest obelisk commemorating an 1841 gale in which 57 of the town’s fishers died. Many of the other old graves contained children. Since the 19th century, child mortality has plummeted a hundredfold in the developed world, Pinker writes in Enlightenment Now. Up the road, in another cemetery, he had once taken a photograph of the tombstone of a father and his five-day-old son. The inscription read: “O Death all Eloquent how dost thou prove / What dust we dote on when we creatures love.” “You need these slices of life to reassure you that the data is not off the mark,” Pinker said of the graves. From a Pinkerian perspective, the story of his own family is the story of modernity’s rising trend lines. He was born in Montreal in 1954 in a community of Jewish refugees. His maternal grandmother lived through the Kishinev pogrom in what is now Moldova, in 1903; his paternal grandmother’s entire family was annihilated in the Holocaust. In Montreal, Pinker’s father lived in what Pinker described as “the most oppressive immigrant poverty”. Eventually, several of the men in the generation above Pinker started flourishing businesses. “I am not the descendant of a long line of rabbis (as an improbably large proportion of Jews claim to be),” Pinker has written, “but of makers or sellers of gloves, neckties, auto parts and women’s garments; I grew up with the belief that God made the Jews as a light unto the nations, and made the gentiles because someone had to buy retail.” In kindergarten, Pinker’s teacher told his mother that he was “the smartest kid she ever taught,” Roslyn recalled. “I came home and said to my husband, ‘You’ll never believe this.’ That was the first time I had thought anything about it.” As a child, Pinker read the encyclopedia cover to cover. As he grew older, his outlook on the world was shaped by the cold war and the domestic upheavals of the 60s. He has said that the first historical event he can recall is the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, and that he can still feel the dread he experienced hearing radio tests of the air-raid siren. It was a politically fraught time in Montreal – a militant leftwing nationalist movement was agitating for the rights of Quebec’s oppressed French-speaking people – and discussions in the Pinker household would often turn on fundamental questions. There were arguments about whether humans were essentially brutish or noble, whether, if left to their own devices, they would devolve into violent anarchy or self-organise into a communalist utopia. Pinker engaged in these debates, but was not exactly a partisan, he told me. “A lot of people would say, ‘I went through my Marx, Rand, Mao, whatever phase,’” he said. “But I was never an ideologue.” In The Blank Slate, he tells a slightly different story, perhaps for effect. “As a young teenager in proudly peaceable Canada during the romantic 1960s, I was a true believer in Bakunin’s anarchism,” he writes. “I laughed off my parents’ argument that if the government ever laid down its arms all hell would break loose. Our competing predictions were put to the test at 8am on 7 October 1969, when the Montreal police went on strike. By 11.20am, the first bank was robbed. By noon, most of the downtown stores were closed because of looting. Within a few more hours, taxi drivers burned down the garage of a limousine service that competed with them for airport customers, a rooftop sniper killed a provincial police officer, rioters broke into several hotels and restaurants, and a doctor slew a burglar in his suburban home.” Pinker concludes: “This decisive empirical test left my politics in tatters (and offered a foretaste of life as a scientist).” But somewhat contrary to this tale of dark human instincts run riot, the Canadian historian Bryan Palmer told me that much of this violence was motivated by the political grievances of the Quebecer minority, and was targeted at Anglo businesses like the limousine service, which was given preferential treatment by the city government. The “sniper” was a security guard from the limousine service who fired a shotgun into a crowd. In 1976, when the cold war was still hot, Pinker began his graduate studies at Harvard, in the department of psychology. He went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, where in 1982 he became a professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences. Pinker’s views of the era in which he grew up and trained as a scientist seem to have stuck with him. In Better Angels, he charts a spike in homicide rates in the 60s that lasted for a generation. He told me this was due to the “depravity that was unleashed” in that decade. “The 60s were a temporary local reversal of the civilising process,” he said, referring to the historical theories of the sociologist Norbert Elias, whose work influenced Better Angels. “If you defy the norms of bourgeois propriety, you’re going to have a lot of macho violence, and in the 1960s it was the bourgeois vision of the nuclear family that we had a lot of contempt for.” Pinker has always searched for universals – the underlying structure shared by all languages, the behaviours practised by all cultures, the traits shared by all minds. In his telling, history, too, revealed basic lessons of human nature. Scoured of its particular economic and political conditions, it had been transformed into a kind of parable. * * * The day after our bike ride, Pinker and I scampered down a short embankment dotted with poison ivy and put in to the little Pamet River in a tandem kayak. I had forgotten to change for the excursion before leaving my rental, so I was wearing an old pair of Pinker’s shorts. We were not far from the mouth of the river, where Pinker proposed to Goldstein, and where he has said he wants his ashes scattered. A few years ago, a massive storm surge had swept salt water up the stream, killing off much of the fauna that inhabited it. Now, as we paddled through lush alleys of cattail and bulrush, frogs seemed to be popping up all around us. “They’ve come back!” Pinker said, delighted. We stopped at an open bend so he could try to take a photo of a frog to send to his wife. The world here was green and bursting with life. I recalled a throwaway line from Enlightenment Now: “Everything is amazing.” Everything, of course, is not amazing. Pinker knows this, but many of his critics say he hasn’t grasped quite how much is going wrong. His data shows that many bad things, from global poverty to racism and sexism, have declined, but a recurring theme of the criticisms is that he’s not always careful with the data (“shockingly shoddy,” is how the historians Philip Dwyer and Mark Micale have put it). Pinker has attempted to address some of these criticisms in a 10,000-word defence of Enlightenment Now in the rightwing publication Quillette. A deeper problem, critics say, is Pinker’s faith in data to reveal the truth. Yes, it would be great to just rely on the data, they argue, but data is interpretive all the way down, shaped by what is collected, how it’s collected and for what purpose. That’s a problem Pinker acknowledges in Enlightenment Now, but never fully reckons with. “When you really dig not only into the facts but into his own sources, it’s fully ideological,” Guilhot, the intellectual historian, told me. Several critics have also argued that it’s cruel to ask people to see themselves as data points along a rising trend line, especially if they happen to be among the many people the trends haven’t lifted up. Others say that progress rarely comes from the cheerleaders of the status quo; it comes from radicals organising against the powers that be. Many point out that, whatever the data may show, the really important question is not how much better the world has become, but how much better it could still be. Pinker’s relative comfort with the status quo has led him into arguments that spill well beyond the covers of his books. He often says he “manages his controversy portfolio carefully”, but controversy seems to have overtaken him in recent years. He has sparked anger by describing “people who gravitate to the alt-right” as “often highly intelligent, highly literate” people; by writing that the Tuskegee study, in which more than a hundred poor African American men were allowed to die of untreated syphilis and related complications, was “a one-time failure to prevent harm to a few dozen people”; and by “drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence”, according to an open letter signed by hundreds of graduate students and more than 180 professors in the field of linguistics. Then there were the pictures that began circulating of him with the financier Jeffrey Epstein at various public events, including after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for sex offences against a minor. It turned out that Pinker had also helped his friend Alan Dershowitz interpret a statute in Epstein’s defence on sex trafficking charges in 2007, the same year Pinker and Dershowitz co-taught Psychology 1002: Morality and Taboo. “He’s sending a signal that men who abuse women are welcome in our field,” Jessica Cantlon, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, told me. (Pinker says he regrets having helped Dershowitz with his defence of Epstein.) Many critics allege that Pinker’s recent remarks are part of a longer history of comments and behaviour that have come dangerously close to promoting pseudoscientific or abhorrent points of view. To take a single example: the journalist Malcolm Gladwell has called Pinker out for sourcing information from the blogger Steve Sailer, who, in Gladwell’s words, “is perhaps best known for his belief that black people are intellectually inferior to white people”. Angela Saini, a science journalist and author of Superior: The Return of Race Science, told me that “for many people, Pinker’s willingness to entertain the work of individuals who are on the far right and white supremacists has gone beyond the pale”. When I put these kinds of criticisms to Pinker, he called it the fallacy of “guilt by association” – just because Sailer and others have objectionable views, doesn’t mean their data is bad. Pinker has condemned racism – he told me it was “not just wrong but stupid” – but published Sailer’s work in an edited volume in 2004, and quotes Sailer’s positive review of Better Angels, among many others, on his website. Pinker cherishes facts over assumptions, but occasionally his assumptions have caused him to rush past the facts. In 2013, Pinker initially defended the philosopher Colin McGinn after McGinn had been accused of sexually harassing a female graduate student, calling McGinn’s actions “no more serious than exchanging sexual banter”. He revised his opinion of the case after being confronted with the evidence. What McGinn did crossed the line, Pinker told me, but he still thought the punishment was disproportionate. (McGinn resigned his position, though it’s unclear under exactly what circumstances.) McGinn later made a failed attempt to start a business ethics consulting firm, and Pinker and Goldstein signed on as advisers. “Rebecca and I were pretty sure that nothing would become of it,” Pinker told me. “It was basically a favour to him, a gesture of friendship with no consequences.” “Depending on how much of a sense of humour you and your editor have, here’s an answer to the question, ‘Are there downsides to being famous?’” Pinker emailed me after I asked him about Epstein, Sailer, McGinn and others. “Yes. Journalists ask you to explain why you’ve been ‘associated with’ various people, out of the thousands you’ve interacted with over the decades, who’ve done something wrong.” Earlier, he had said of the various criticisms he has faced, “It’s as unpleasant as you’d expect. But I do my humanly best. I process them as part of a set of stress management strategies – not before bed, often on an airplane when I’m already miserable.” Ultimately, though, Pinker sees this as part of the job of the public intellectual. “This is the business we’ve chosen,” he said, quoting The Godfather Part II. “People are going to attack me, and I’m going to attack back.” * * * Although the controversies Pinker generates have intensified, it’s not because his basic view of the world has changed. What has changed is the world. The same defence of capitalism and liberal democracy that animates much of Enlightenment Now can be found, in miniature, in The Blank Slate, though between them stand the financial crisis, the migrant crisis, the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the rise of social media and authoritarian populism, and numerous increasingly alarming reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. At the same time, over the past decade or so, a greater diversity of people have entered academia and public discourse, and have challenged opinions that were once considered acceptable. “There’s a huge reckoning happening,” Saini said. It’s hard not to see Pinker’s latest book, Rationality, which walks readers through various cognitive biases, as a response to his critics – particularly those who lacked “the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place or not”. In Enlightenment Now, Pinker recommends “cognitive debiasing” programmes as part of a strategy of countering irrationality in the world; Rationality reads like the centrepiece of the curriculum. If only everyone were capable of reasoning properly, Pinker sometimes seems to imply, then our endless political arguments would not occupy so much of public life. Instead of being consumed by conflict, we would be busily problem-solving. “I think the issue that a lot of people have with Pinker is that, for someone who is so exercised about other people’s biases and lack of rationality and logic, he sometimes feels a little reluctant to question his own,” Saini said. Pinker’s methods sometimes seem cynical, but I never got the sense that he was anything less than sincere. He agrees with his leftwing critics that we are living in a precarious moment, in which hard-fought-for advances in human wellbeing are under threat. He consistently says that the political battle against the Trumpist, authoritarian, conspiratorial right is of primary importance. But the cultural and ideological battle against what he called “woke-ism, Occupy Wall Street leftism, Rage Against the Machine leftism, Extinction Rebellion – these rather cynical and destructive movements” seems to occupy more of his emotional energy. In his view, many factions on the left see the world as a zero-sum battle for supremacy among different racial, ethnic and gender groups. He also believes that the excesses of the left are partly to blame for the dangerous lunacy of the right. “Unlike a lot of academics, I actually have conservative and libertarian friends,” he said. “They sometimes ask me, ‘Why should we trust climate science when anyone with an opposing view would be cancelled?’ I disagree about the climate science, but it’s otherwise a good point.” To fight back against this, Pinker has joined the boards of more than half a dozen organisations that say they are dedicated to promoting free speech. When I began listing a few to check which ones he belonged to, he interjected: “I’m on the board of all of them!” He went on: “The reason these organisations are so important is that a lot of repression comes from a small number of activists. Even if they’re not a majority view, a radical minority can become a repressive regime.” In Better Angels, he continued, he wrote about this dynamic of the “spiral of silence”, which led to witch-hunts, the Inquisition, the French Revolution, Stalinism and Nazi Germany. He also compared what he sees as the intellectual bankruptcy of woke orthodoxy to the folktale The Emperor’s New Clothes. “It takes a little boy to point it out,” he said. * * * On my last morning on the Cape, I strolled through Provincetown to the wharf where Pinker and I were taking the ferry to Boston. While I waited for him in the queue for the boat, a man and his boyfriend announced their engagement to a group of friends – then joked they only did it so one would be eligible for the other’s healthcare benefits. The moral circle was expanding, but maybe not as far as it could. Back in Boston, Pinker showed me around the spacious open-plan apartment he shares with Goldstein, in a converted leather warehouse. On a wall opposite the front door were two large photographs of the couple with the Obamas on the day that Goldstein was presented with the National Humanities medal, in 2015. If anywhere were western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic, it was this million-dollar former warehouse with photos of Barack Obama on the wall. Pinker’s apartment seemed to contain the curated fruits of his career. Gazing down on the room was a nearly lifesize portrait of him, reading a book. On another wall was a caricature of him which first appeared in the New York Review of Books. A small painting of him was lying loose on top of a low bookshelf. “One of the things that happens when you’re famous is that people send portraits to you,” he said, bemused. Next to the portrait was a little pile of new translations of Enlightenment Now – Italian, Japanese, Hungarian. Standing at the centre of the apartment like a statue, in the dead space where his study and the living room converged, was a glass magazine rack, about the height of Pinker himself. Displayed on its zigzagging levels were publications, some more than a decade old, with his or Goldstein’s face staring up from the covers. “What’s on the rack are basically things that we don’t feel we can throw out, but not the things that we tend to read in bed,” he later joked. Success tends to be its own justification, and the evidence that Pinker’s approach to the world works for him was all around us. “Celebrity is bizarre,” I remarked. Pinker grinned. “Yes it is,” he said. Pinker and I had planned to go up to Harvard to see his office, which he hadn’t entered since the start of the pandemic, nearly a year and a half earlier. Before we left, I asked to see a pair of black caiman-leather cowboy boots he had custom made for him by the legendary bootmaker Lee Miller, part of his signature look at public events. (“He told me he likes cowboy boots because it’s the only way a man can get away with wearing high heels,” Pinker’s friend the biologist Jerry Coyne told me. “He likes mostly reptile boots, I think.”) Pinker showed me the boots, but opted to wear a pair of driving loafers designed by Nicolas Sarkozy’s son Louis, for whom Pinker is a celebrity model. Earlier, Pinker had picked up a chunk of graffitied concrete, the size of an American football, from the top of one of his shelves. “Part of the Berlin Wall,” he said. His father had brought it back from a business trip he took to Germany in the weeks the wall was coming down. Pinker put the souvenir back in its place, where it lay like a page torn from a book. “Whatever happened to good old liberalism?” Pinker said to me later, exasperated but cheerful. “Who’s going to actually step in and defend the idea that incremental improvements fed by knowledge, fed by expanding equality, fed by liberal democracy, are a good thing? Where are the demonstrations, where are the people pumping their fists for liberal democracy? Who’s going to actually say something good about it?” This article was amended on 28 September 2021 because an earlier version referred to “Quebec’s... French-speaking minority”.

As far as the eye can see, deep gashes scar the earth. At the spot where the giant machines stand, ancient layers of bared coal are visible all the way to the base of the pit. Georg Ortmann walks along a bridge 40 metres above the mine to check that sand and gravel taken from the earth’s top layers are not sticking to the conveyor belt removing them from the precious lignite beneath. “My job is to make sure the dirt is moved from one side of the pit to the other,” he jokes. This is Reichwalde, one of two open-cast lignite mines that supply Boxberg coal-fired power plant. Boxberg was East Germany’s biggest power station and climate campaigners now rank it high among the “dirty 30” of Europe’s most polluting. Reichwalde operates 365 days of the year, in all weathers. It is a physically demanding job and Ortmann has spent his entire working life in these craters. The 62-year-old is one of about 6,000 coal miners left in eastern Germany’s Lusatia region, once the German Democratic Republic’s mining and industrial heartland. “In East Germany, people who went through the school system had a chance at the nicer indoor jobs. I quit school early,” he says. Before the collapse of East Germany and reunification, the brown coal industry in this region directly employed 100,000 people. Coal was not just the main employer in Lusatia. Miners enjoyed a special status as proud contributors to energy independence in the socialist state. Ich bin Bergmann, wer ist mehr? (I’m a miner, who is more?) was a phrase commonly heard during the cold war. Germany pledged last year to end all coal mining by 2038 in line with its EU and global climate obligations. This has deepened existing political tensions in its coal-dependent regions. In Lusatia, it has placed climate activists on a collision course with local politicians, the coal companies and the communities whose incomes depend on coal. “Coal is a very emotive topic here,” says Adrian Rinnert from the local NGO Strukturwandel Jetzt, which has opposed the expansion of these mines for nearly a decade. The big problem, he thinks, is the lack of alternative economic opportunities. Although tens of thousands of mining jobs have been cut since the 1990s, most available employment in the region is still tied to coal. Mainstream German parties still champion the industry, and as in other parts of Europe, the impact of green policies on traditional or left-behind communities has become a convenient agenda for populists and far-right politicians to latch on to. “When people here discuss whether environmental protection or jobs are more important, it’s always the jobs that win,” Rinnert says. Coronavirus brought the coal plant sit-ins and the conflicts to a temporary halt in March, but the battle is resuming as Germany gets back to business. Brown coal, or lignite, of the kind mined in Lusatia is the most polluting fuel in the world, and it still powers 14 % of Germany’s energy, which is a higher reliance than any other EU country. The global climate movement has repeatedly demanded that Germany decarbonise faster. For Wiebke Witt, a brown coal expert for the NGO Klima Allianz Deutschland, Germany’s 2038 closure timeline fails to honour the 2015 Paris climate agreement on ending coal energy production. “When the end date for coal was negotiated, talks revolved around the amount of energy produced from coal and not for instance the impact it continues to have on the climate,” Witt says. Belgium, Austria and Sweden are already coal-free. The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and is predicted to achieve full closure by 2027. But Germany wants to keep production going well into the 2030s and some mines are expanding. Witt cites the new Datteln IV coal plant that Germany will add to the grid this summer, a move protesters call “climate policy madness”. The coal lobby, and many politicians, argue that Germany still needs lignite because it is already committed to shuttering nuclear power plants by 2022. And renewables are being built at a pace too slow to meet the country’s current energy needs. The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being Georg Ortmann “The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being,” says Ortmann, the miner. He points to the dark layer at the bottom of the pit. Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air. The coal companies’ logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath existing villages. Bulldozing a village One of those villages is Mühlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So Mühlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved. Of the village’s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people’s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says. Yet some in Mühlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. “We’ve suffered here for years,” says Reinhild Martin. The 69-year-old owns a restaurant in the village, an establishment opened by her grandfather. Most villagers have mixed feelings about their proximity to the mine. Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable. Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, Mühlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated. Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. “Once they start ripping down the houses, I don’t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,” she says. In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed. Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany’s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of the country’s landscape. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged. Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. “The coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?” Some old mines have been flooded to create artificial lakes, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. “Right now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes. I don’t think that the plans to turn them into a holiday destination and new job sector will work out,” Rinnert says. Populists hijack local emotions Away from the eastern German coalfields, the climate crisis has mobilised public consciousness across Europe, uniting anti-coal campaigners with Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future school movement. In Brussels, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister and ally of Angela Merkel, is pushing the so-called EU green deal under which the 27-nation bloc would become carbon neutral by 2050. Poland is the only EU country that has refused to sign up to that goal, and its rejection is driven by coal. Lusatia runs along the German/Polish border. It is hard to find anyone on either side who does not reject the need for a fast exit from fossil fuels. Miners feel unjustly scapegoated. “For climate protesters we are like filth and to be blamed for climate change. It feels unfair,” says Ortmann. “If we could, we would earn our money in another way. But moral lectures don’t really help when people’s livelihoods are at stake.” The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party disputes climate science, but in Lusatia has matched its campaigning to the sentiments of people such as Ortmann, focusing (with strong echoes of the “gilets jaunes” demands in France) on the individual’s right to drive their own car and the unfairness of fuel taxes. Toni Schneider, an AfD politician in the Lusatian town of Hoyerswerda, claims the coal protest movement is not organised by local activists, but by people from “big cities”. “I have seen how they arrive here by train. From how they act it seems like these protesters come on a fun weekend trip and not a serious demonstration.” This culture war framing – rust-belt people being lectured to by outsiders and metropolitans – helps the AfD to manipulate local emotion and discredit local protesters, according to Rinnert. “The populists know how to address people’s feelings, which is why the AfD has such a large supporter base here in the Lusatia region.” This coal region spans the German states of Brandenburg and Saxony. Last year the AfD surged in popularity to win 27% of the votes in Saxony’s state elections and 23.5% in Brandenburg, becoming the second biggest political party in both states. The party campaigned on a platform of delaying the deadline for closing the Lusatia mines. “We need more infrastructure for new industries, and for instance fast internet access for all households before quitting coal can be even considered,” Schneider says. A parallel surge in support for the Greens nationally means the party could plausibly be in government after the next election. After explosives were placed in our letterbox, I filed a police complaint. Nothing came of it Adrian Rinnert Activists in Lusatia feel the personal consequences of this political polarisation. Rinnert, like the miner Ortmann, lives in the town of Weisswasser, where he has been on the receiving end of hate and physical attacks. He even considered leaving when threats started to include his family. “After explosives were placed in our letterbox, I filed a complaint with the local police.” Rinnert says. “Nothing has ever come out of it.” What comes after coronavirus? The law underpinning Germany’s exit from coal was planned for May or June, but the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed its introduction to parliament. The law’s likely winners are the coal companies, which have been promised generous compensation. Der Spiegel reported in January that LEAG would be in line for €1.75bn (£1.55bn) from the state. Germany has pledged €40bn to help coal regions to restructure. But the losers will be the people who live next to the pits and who will go on suffering the polluting consequences for almost a decade longer than foreseen by the Paris agreement. “When you compare the draft law with other European measures, Germany remains the only country that is compensating companies for the coal exit,” Witt says. With big gatherings impossible for now, campaigners in Germany have been forced to scale down the anti-coal protests. However, both sides of this political struggle will use the pandemic to advance their opposing visions for energy in the post-shutdown future. Some experts believe the lockdown has accelerated a long-term global shift away from coal. Britain has gone more than a month without burning coal to generate electricity, the longest recorded stretch since the Industrial Revolution. A public backlash against air pollution could also strengthen the resolve of European governments to speed up the switch from fossil fuels. But a back-to-business decarbonisation backlash is also a risk depending on the depth of the recession. “We have now been told that we are part of an essential service to the state,” Ortmann laughs. Throughout the lockdown, production has carried on uninterrupted, Ortmann and his colleagues working their busy shifts at Reichwalde tending to the gigantic machines. Ortmann can retire in two years. “I’m counting down the months,” he says. Exhaustion and other side-effects are taking their toll. “Working in shifts has given me insomnia. The strong vibrations from the bridge give me aches in my bones and muscles that I can still feel when I get home.” A coal miner’s pension is still one of the best available, topping the average eastern German retirement benefit of €1,252 a month. Ortmann knows he is one of the lucky few. With stable jobs in short supply and the political fight over coal’s closure still raging, his younger colleagues lack any such certainty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-11T12:43:19Z","webTitle":"What is the Green New Deal and how would it benefit society?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey","fields":{"headline":"What is the Green New Deal and how would it benefit society?","bodyText":"Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, along with dozens of co-sponsors, have introduced a vision for the Green New Deal. One Republican called it a “socialist manifesto”. Many environmental advocacy groups have hailed it, but some say it doesn’t go far enough. Others warn that its broad scope and the long list of progressive social programs it endorses could hinder its climate efforts. So what is the Green New Deal? The proposal outlines the broad principles of a plan simultaneously to fight inequity and tackle climate change. It does not contain policy details or advocate for specific ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But with a broad brush it aims to begin to make the US carbon-neutral – net zero carbon emissions – in 10 years. The Green New Deal recognizes that transition would require massive change. It endorses ways of ensuring that vulnerable populations – including the poor, people of color, indigenous populations and communities already facing environmental degradation – take part in the planning process and benefit from the green economy. Would it end the use of coal, oil and natural gas? No. But it would aim to offset any remaining greenhouse gas pollution with forests that absorb carbon dioxide, for example. It does not specifically address what role nuclear power or fossil fuels with carbon capture technologies would play. Nuclear power represents half of the carbon-free energy in the US, but it runs on mined uranium. Fossil fuels with carbon capture would still require drilling and cause pollution. How ambitious is the Green New Deal? Incredibly ambitious, both on climate change and with its reimagining of society. Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in the US economy. Of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the US in 2016, 28% were from electricity, 28% were from transportation, 22% were from industry, 11% were commercial and residential and 9% were from agriculture. US climate efforts so far have focused on the power sector, which is probably the easiest to decarbonize. Many states and localities have continued that work even as the federal government ignores climate change. But coal is being replacing with both renewable power and natural gas. Natural gas has a smaller carbon footprint than coal but still causes climate change. Additionally, climate advocates and policy experts across the country have not typically tried to address every contributor to global warming at once or while addressing other societal issues. This kind of system-wide thinking and planning would be difficult to adopt. The energy shift would require a major investment, as would the social programs highlighted in the Green New Deal. The resolution does not suggest a source for that money. The politics of the plan are also difficult, with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House vehemently opposed to it, and with some Democrats split over whether it is the right approach. How would it fight climate change? The goals of the document include a “10-year national mobilization” to: build resiliency against climate change-related disasters upgrade infrastructure meet power demand with “clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources” expand energy efficiency and access to power work with farmers to cut emissions overhaul the transportation sector with electric vehicles, public transportation and high-speed rail remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by bolstering forests What does the science recommend? The earth has seen about 1C (1.8F) of warming since industrialization. Scientists say limiting warming to 1.5C would require cutting manmade carbon levels by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero around 2050. The US currently generates about 15% of that greenhouse gas pollution, although it is the biggest contributor historically. Exceeding 1.5C of warming by half a degree will worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. What would the Green New Deal do for people? The proposal lays out numerous “crises”, including declining life expectancy for many Americans, as well as wage stagnation and income inequality. The Green New Deal calls for: a guaranteed job with fair pay, family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security universal high-quality healthcare free higher education access to affordable, safe and adequate housing stronger labor, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and wage and hour standards the clean-up of hazardous waste sites access to clean water and air, health and affordable food, and nature"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/16/taxpayers-face-extra-nuclear-cleanup-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-16T09:00:37Z","webTitle":"Sellafield boss warns on nuclear clean-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/taxpayers-face-extra-nuclear-cleanup-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/dec/16/taxpayers-face-extra-nuclear-cleanup-cost","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield boss warns on nuclear clean-up","bodyText":"The government body given the job of cleaning up Britain’s old nuclear power stations has warned that taxpayers will have to help plug a looming multimillion-pound gap in its finances left by shrinking revenues. David Peattie, chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, said revenues would fall more than 10% annually in coming years due to the end of an era of nuclear waste reprocessing. One plant ceased operations in November and another will stop in two years. The group has a £3bn annual budget to clean up 17 old nuclear sites around the UK, but earns £1bn a year from services including repurposing spent nuclear fuel. “I don’t think we can fill the hole completely,” Peattie said. He hopes to offset some of the losses by making better use of the NDA’s fleet of four ships that operate out of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The ships were used to bring spent fuel from as far afield as Japan back to the UK for reprocessing. Peattie also hopes to secure more non-nuclear work such as the non-food cargo it handles for Tesco using its rail business, which runs around 100 locomotives. The rail unit transports waste from nuclear power stations to be stored at the NDA’s biggest and most costly site, Sellafield in Cumbria. The final bill could also be reduced, said Peattie if the public accepted that not all old nuclear facilities would be returned to a pristine field of “buttercups and daisies”. The legacy of the industrial revolution means people already tolerate “industrial clutter” in parts of the countryside, he said, citing the example of 19th-century mining buildings around Coniston Water, one of the biggest lakes in the Lake District. It would be cheaper and could be more sensible to leave some of the concrete remains of old nuclear plants and simply fence them off, once they had been declared safe, he said. “[But] if we want to take sites back to moorland for people to enjoy or build houses on … if society wants us to go to that extreme of clean-up, there’s a cost to society,” he said. A former oil man who spent years in Russia with BP, Peattie was appointed in spring 2017. The chief executive said work had progressed faster than expected on the most hazardous part of Sellafield, the so-called legacy ponds and silo, where cold war-era waste was dumped. “People just didn’t know what was in there. The guys who built it are all dead.” He defended the NDA over MPs’ criticism that Sellafield is running over budget and behind schedule on works. The Public Accounts Committee said projects costing hundreds of millions of pounds had been cancelled, but Peattie said that was sometimes a result of changing technology. “It’s like the horse and car. We are getting the horse to go faster and then somebody invents a car. What we can do better is fail faster.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/oct/17/unnatural-selection-netflix-docuseries-gene-editing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-17T05:00:49Z","webTitle":"Unnatural Selection: the eye-opening Netflix docuseries on gene editing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/17/unnatural-selection-netflix-docuseries-gene-editing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/17/unnatural-selection-netflix-docuseries-gene-editing","fields":{"headline":"Unnatural Selection: the eye-opening Netflix docuseries on gene editing","bodyText":"“Today, we are learning the language in which God created life,” said then-president Bill Clinton, alongside the British prime minister, Tony Blair, in 2000. In the grainy archival clip, scientists and dignitaries had just mapped out the human genome, dissecting the complex science of biological being to code sequences of A, C, G and T in a style similar to binary computer code. But almost 20 years later, science has surpassed this once-unimaginable feat with the discovery of technology which can alter that genetic code. This zeitgeist-y innovation is the subject of a new Netflix series, Unnatural Selection, from film-makers Joe Egender and Leeor Kaufman, and explores the various forms of genetic engineering, as well as the societal and environmental implications of its research and use. The four-part docuseries delves into the burgeoning field of gene technology, made possible by the aforementioned human genome project and the discovery of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats or Crispr. Co-discovered by Dr Jennifer Doudna, the gene serves a bit like “a molecular scalpel”, she says, essentially removing and replacing gene material in a DNA strand. The technology makes it possible to modify genetics, giving it near unlimited biological potential, or as Salk Institute developmental biologist Professor Juan Izpuisua Belmonte puts it, “… rewriting the book of life”. It may all sound like science fiction but, as film-maker Joe Egender discovered, the future is, in fact, now. “I come from the fiction world and I was doing some research to create a science fiction script, actually,” Egender tells the Guardian. During research, he ran across an article about Crispr and was stunned by the science. “I couldn’t believe it, that we could actually edit the essence of life, DNA.” Later, over a dinner conversation, he spoke to Leeor Kaufman, who convinced him the material would make a good documentary, if, and only if, there were advancements being made. They found an entire world teeming to express their feelings on the avant-garde technology. “This is the beginning of a new revolution and, fortunately, we were making these calls right when these pioneers were just getting going,” said Egender. “The moment we started talking to people, we understood how there were so many different things that altering DNA can affect, whether it’s medicine or the environment or obviously designing animals, plants and humans,” said Kaufman. For Egender and Kaufman, the series had to tell the broader, more intricate story of genetic engineering, a story filled with great risk, benefits, consequences, emotions, sentiments and future, to better illuminate the field and further the discussion on the technology. “We’re not just talking about science, these are actual things that are happening and the stories are very complex and ongoing,” stated Kaufman. For example, many are depending on gene therapy treatment to change and possibly save lives. But, the series shows, the treatments are expensive, with some emerging drugs costing over $500,000, and patients are often at the mercy of startup genetic therapy companies who choose to weigh the “meaning” of the treatment versus the cost for the patient, leaving many to fight their insurance companies for the cost of treatment. One episode shows the uses for the technology in a changing climate. Due to the climate crisis, New Zealand is suffering a boom in rodents, invasive species which threaten the native bird population. With genetic engineering, Dr Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer profiled in the series, hopes to foster a process called gene drive in rodents, a technology designed to transmit a particular suite of genes throughout a population through breeding. While it would effectively solve the problem, it also raises fears among New Zealanders of eugenics and ecological collapse. They are not alone in their worry. The series is haunted by feelings of ambivalence from the scientists who are cautious about tipping the scales towards a possible dystopian future. Even Dr Doudna, the scientist who co-discovered the Crispr gene sequence, regularly expresses caution about gene engineering. No longer worried whether the technology will work, the scientists are concerned it might be used against people and push the world toward doom. Kaufman described their caution: “These people are already living tomorrow’s dilemmas, tomorrow’s ethics, tomorrow’s financial world in a way and we can learn about tomorrow from them.” Dr Esvelt pioneered the gene drive technique and is hopeful it can partially temper the effects of climate change. But even he remarks, “The prospect of a wave of genetically modified anything sweeping generation after generation, geographically expanding into city, country, across continents, is utterly terrifying.” Although he decides to explore the unknown, despite his ambivalence, others are not so optimistic about the use and development of technology. In the series, environmentalist Jim Thomas describes the potential magnitude of the technology: “To me, it’s the most high-leverage technology I’ve seen after maybe nuclear power.” Politically, the technology raises several eyebrows. Activist Dana Perls poses the question: “Genetic engineering brings up the issue of control. Who is profiting? Who is controlling the technology? Agro-business companies, chemical companies, mega-companies are interested because it allows them to control nature.” Egender acknowledged the fear is valid but opts to consider it from another angle. “There may be reasons to fear the technology. There may be reasons to champion the technology. But I think what is certain is that, as a society, we need to better understand the technology and start discussing it so that we collectively can make some of these decisions, rather than leaving it up to only the people in the know, only the people in the lab, only the people with the power.” Kaufman agreed: “A lot of people when they hear about it for the first time, a lot of the reactions are fear.” He continued: “The best thing we can do as a society is not to fear it, but to address it and then understand what specifically we think, where specifically we shouldn’t go and where we actually should or could because it can make a kid see or it can make people in Burkina Faso not suffer from a horrible disease that in other places people are not suffering from …” Unnatural Selection demonstrates the worry of many, and the hope of others, threaded into a huge tapestry of possibility of a more perfect future. While so many things may not come to pass, one thing, however, is clear. “We know very well from human history we’re not going to put this back in the bottle. The technology is there. It’s going to be used,” says Kaufman. While he doubts the series will change the minds of the public about genetic engineering, but hopes it will educate some about both the benefits and risks of genetic engineering. “We don’t expect anyone to decide by a show on Netflix. We expect people to learn from a show on Netflix.” Unnatural Selection is available on Netflix from 18 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2019/apr/18/anonymous-comes-to-town-hackers-take-on-sexual-assault-in-ohio","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-18T12:26:34Z","webTitle":"Anonymous Comes to Town: hackers take on sexual assault in Ohio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/18/anonymous-comes-to-town-hackers-take-on-sexual-assault-in-ohio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2019/apr/18/anonymous-comes-to-town-hackers-take-on-sexual-assault-in-ohio","fields":{"headline":"Anonymous Comes to Town: hackers take on sexual assault in Ohio","bodyText":"The sleepy, rust-belt city of Steubenville, Ohio, was once best known for its high school sports and for being the birthplace of Dean Martin. That changed after the 2012 rape of a 16-year-old girl by two teenage members of the local football team, brought to national attention by the hacking network Anonymous, which published videos and social media from the night of the assault. Anonymous Comes to Town explores the aftermath of the events of 11 August 2012, a night that divided Steubenville but in the process emboldened generations of women to speak up about abuse. The documentary also asks: when is it OK for outsiders to intervene? Anonymous Comes to Town is supported by Chime. The director, Nancy Schwartzman, is a documentary maker, producer, and media strategist who uses storytelling and technology to create safer communities for women and girls. The themes in Anonymous Comes to Town are further explored in her feature documentary Roll Red Roll. Coming up: Sam and the Plant Next Door As the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant rises from the ground next to his home, 11-year-old Sam cannot stop worrying about what will happen to the fish. A documentary that explores themes of holding on and letting go, and growing up. Documentary news and screenings Seahorse, a feature-length documentary about a trans man who gives birth, made in association with the Guardian, plays at HotDocs, in Toronto on 30 April and 1 May. The programme for the whole festival is worth checking out, including the much-anticipated XY Chelsea, about the whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and Buddy, made by the Dutch documentary maestro Heddy Honigmann, about service dogs. At the ICA, in London, the Frames of Representation festival concludes this weekend with two treats: an improvised live performance from two documentary editors about love, sexuality and gender; and Present Perfect, about live streaming in China. Elsewhere in the UK, Home in Manchester is showing the powerful documentary The Nightcleaners in May, which explores the struggle to unionise female workers who clean office blocks at night.

In Glasgow, there is a very special music documentary event this weekend, featuring Beth Gibbons of Portishead performing Henryk Górecki’s Symphony No 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs), a meditation incorporating elements of a 15th-century Polish lament of Mother Mary, a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during the second world war, and a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2019/nov/21/richard-lindley-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-21T12:49:08Z","webTitle":"Richard Lindley obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/21/richard-lindley-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2019/nov/21/richard-lindley-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Richard Lindley obituary","bodyText":"Richard Lindley, who has died from heart disease aged 83, was the first western television journalist to interview Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator brought into the world’s spotlight following the Israeli air strike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981. “He was just like all the pictures of Joseph Stalin, full of smiles and charms,” Lindley recalled of his BBC Panorama programme, broadcast a month after the air strike. “He had a gang of kids running around for him. Obviously, we know now he was a murderous man, an awfully violent man who was responsible for so many deaths.” By then, Lindley was a seasoned foreign correspondent, having spent nearly a decade with Panorama, but he had approached his early assignments at ITN (1964-72) for ITV news and current affairs programmes with some trepidation. He compared covering events in what was then Rhodesia following the 1965 unilateral declaration of independence by its prime minister, Ian Smith, with his days as a second lieutenant leading a platoon through the Malayan jungle during national service. “Somehow, I managed to convert a potentially paralysing fear of failure into action,” he said. “And it’s been the same on every story I’ve ever covered. I always have to use my fear of failure as the spur to get me out and about in an effort to survive the latest test.” The tests were many, high-profile and sometimes shocking. During the Biafran war in eastern Nigeria (1967-70) he was a familiar figure – tall and slim, reporting the horrors with a cut-glass English home counties accent – as gunfire raged around him and, away from the action, telling the stories of the conflict’s young orphans. As one of the first journalists to enter the conquered Biafran territory at the end of the civil war, he interviewed Igbo women who claimed to have been raped by federal soldiers. Later in Dhaka, at the end of the fighting between India and Pakistan that saw the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, Lindley showed a quality that marked him apart from some of his war correspondent colleagues. Presented with the chance to shoot exclusive television pictures of a guerrilla leader having prisoners tortured, he and his team walked away, fearing that their presence was encouraging the violence. Two stills photographers who captured the subsequent bayoneting to death of the prisoners won a Pulitzer prize, while ITN had no coverage of the shocking climax. This moral awareness, along with his modesty, reserved manner and integrity, made Lindley revered by those who worked with him. Yemen, Vietnam and the six-day war between Israel and its Arab neighbours were among his other battlegrounds before he left ITN in 1973 to join the BBC and Panorama, where he remained for 15 years. As a reporter, he was in Iran in 1973 examining the Shah’s arms spending and, six years later, covering the return of Ayatollah Khomeini. At home he examined race relations in 1977 and nuclear power in 1979, and interviewed Margaret Thatcher shortly after the start of the Falklands war in 1982. When he took over as presenter of Panorama that year, one TV critic described Lindley as “a cross between Barry Norman and Sir Alec Douglas-Home”. Rhodesia and its transformation into Zimbabwe spanned much of his television career. For Panorama he interviewed in 1975 a white farmer and black barrister, asking whether all the races could ever live together, before returning five years later to look at the prospects for the country after independence. He was in South Africa in 1992 for ITV’s current affairs programme This Week, reporting on the establishment of an Afrikaner whites-only homeland in the Northern Cape. Richard was born in Winchester, Hampshire, to Guy Lindley, an army lieutenant colonel, and Penelope (nee Hatchell). He was educated at Bedford school and served with the Royal Hampshire regiment in what was then Malaya during the so-called emergency – the war between Commonwealth forces and guerrillas fighting for liberation – which led him to question authority. While studying English literature at Queens’ College, Cambridge, he chaired the film society. He began his career making commercials as a producer for the advertising agency Foote, Cone &amp; Belding (1960-62), then worked for the ITV company ABC as a writer and reporter on the religious show The Sunday Break until 1964. He was also a reporter and presenter with Southern Television (1963-64). At ITN one of his lighter assignments was interviewing the Beatles on their 1966 tour of the US, after Christian groups protested against John Lennon’s assertion that the group were more popular than Jesus. “When we say anything like that, we don’t say it to be offensive,” Paul McCartney told Lindley. When News at Ten was launched as television’s first half-hour news programme in 1967, he was one of ITN’s four correspondents roaming the world, alongside Sandy Gall, Alan Hart and John Edwards. While at the BBC, he also present- ed Saturday Briefing (1982-83) and the news review This Week Next Week (1988-89). He returned to ITV as a reporter on This Week (1989-92), presented the ITN World News on cable and satellite (1992-94) and made special reports for News at Ten (1995-99). Lindley had a brief period (1988-89) at the Independent Broadcasting Authority, commercial television’s regulator, as senior programme officer, checking that factual output met the guidelines for impartiality. He wrote two books about his former employers, Panorama: 50 Years of Pride and Paranoia (2002) and And Finally … ? The News from ITN (2005). He was appointed MBE in 2017. A year earlier he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease; his death came a month after sustaining multiple injuries when he was run over by a lorry. Lindley’s first marriage, to Clare Fehrsen in 1976, ended in divorce 10 years later. He is survived by their children, Tom and Jo, by his second wife, Carole Stone, a former producer of BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions?, whom he married in 1999, and by his sister, Caroline. Anthony Hayward Robin Denselow writes: I first met Richard Lindley when I was working as a producer on Panorama in the programme’s glory days in the late 1970s. The office was packed with reporters of great talent, and often even greater ego, and Richard stood out among them as something of an old-fashioned gentleman, who managed to match dignity and coolth with journalistic skill and quiet bravery. In 1975, during the Angolan civil war, we had been filming on the front line when we were arrested as spies by the ruling MPLA party. Held in a cramped schoolroom, we were told, at gunpoint, that “tomorrow will be very bad for you” – and then forced to clean out the blocked toilets with our hands. Richard led the crew in singing spirituals as we worked. Four years later we were in Rhodesia, trying to uncover the realities of the liberation war. Using a rather large “hidden camera”, we met Zapu fighters out in the bush, and then spent time in a camp of American ex-Vietnam mercenaries fighting for Ian Smith, who were using fake “freedom fighters” to carry out atrocities to discredit the true “boys in the bush”. We managed to get the film home safely, and after it was broadcast I received a letter – which still holds pride of place in my toilet – telling me I was banned from Rhodesia, and that “this decision follows your recent visit to this country with Mr Richard Lindley”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jul/02/uk-nuclear-cleanup-contract-back-in-public-hands-after-122m-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T12:25:55Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear cleanup contract back in public hands after £122m bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/02/uk-nuclear-cleanup-contract-back-in-public-hands-after-122m-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jul/02/uk-nuclear-cleanup-contract-back-in-public-hands-after-122m-bill","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear cleanup contract back in public hands after £122m bill","bodyText":"The UK government has been forced to take a multibillion-pound nuclear cleanup contract back into public ownership, after a botched tender to the private sector landed the taxpayer with a £122m bill. The government will take over the decommissioning of Britain’s 12 Magnox sites, including the former nuclear power stations at Dungeness in Kent and Hinkley Point in Somerset. The move is a response to the fallout from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) awarding a 14-year deal to the international consortium Cavendish Fluor Partnership in 2014. Last year the government settled with two US companies that lost out on the £6.2bn contract and brought a legal challenge over the tender process. Ministers terminated the contract early, leading to speculation over whether it would be put out to tender again to the private sector or brought back into public hands. David Peattie, the NDA’s chief executive, told staff he understood they had faced uncertainty in recent months, as he confirmed that the private company Magnox Ltd would become a subsidiary of the NDA on 1 September. He said the change would result in “more efficient decommissioning”. A source close to the process said: “The reason that this has been done is to remove some of the commercial complications and the large fees paid to contractors. This will ensure more money is spent directly on cleaning up these sites.” Unions said they wanted talks with the new management regime for assurances over pay and terms. Peter McIntosh, the Unite union’s acting national officer for energy, said: “This decision is long overdue. The 2014 contract should not have been awarded to any organisation.” He added: “We need to ensure the taxpayer gets value for money through the transfer of the business and it is not paid for at the expense of the workforce.” Whitehall’s spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), has strongly criticised the NDA and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy over the handling and oversight of the nuclear cleanup contract, one of the government’s biggest ever. A review of the failings that led to the bungled process, written by the former National Grid boss Steve Holliday, is due to be published later this year. Bringing the Magnox work back into the public sector means that about 85% of Britain’s nuclear cleanup work is in public hands, after the NDA’s takeover of the Sellafield storage and reprocessing site in 2016. The PAC last week announced an inquiry into the NDA’s work at Sellafield, which is forecast to be £913m over budget and faces potential delays.

Renewables are the way to a clean future”). The bigger picture is that we can expect to see a substantial and sustained increase in electricity demand over the next 20-30 years due to the electrification of transport and heat. Heat alone, by the most conservative estimates, will add 300GW of peak thermal demand, which would add 100GW to the grid, dwarfing the current 65GW or so of peak UK demand. Yes, renewables backed up with energy storage and smart control can make an impact but a significant baseload method will still be needed. As pointed out in the late David Mackay’s excellent book Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air, the least bad option of meeting this is likely to be nuclear fission. Chris Underwood, professor emeritus of energy modelling for the built environment Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne Opposition to nuclear power in the UK has largely focused on the risks of an accident and the enormous cost of waste disposal, officially running at more than £100bn. Also, high-quality uranium ore is in short supply, and can only supply the world’s existing reactors for another 50 years. After that the energy required to extract fissile material from low-quality ore will exceed the energy produced, at which point the technology becomes unsustainable. Recently, the chancellor admitted that he had delayed crucial legislation under pressure from the gambling industry. The only way to rationalise the UK’s chaotic energy policy is to accept that the nuclear and fracking industries have better lobbyists than the renewable sector. Dr Robin Russell-Jones, chair, Help Rescue the Planet Marlow, Buckinghamshire Your business leader identified the key problem in the building of new nuclear power stations – that the government meant it to be funded by the private sector. Unfortunately, you then focus instead on the idea that renewables will be cheaper. You do recognise that there will continue to be a need for subsidies for renewables, but you say nothing of the actual costs and efficiency of renewables in the longer term. The answer is for the government to fund the building and running of new nuclear power stations as part of a nationalised energy industry, alongside sensible investment in much more powerful requirements on insulating all new-build properties and developing renewable sources that are efficient and reliable. The idea that nuclear power stations can be built in the UK by the Chinese and French governments but not our own is nonsensical. Diane Ordish Brighton Honour the unsung heroes Tim Adams noted that when he went to see Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old “everyone in the cinema stayed in silence to watch the credits” (“We properly honour the past when we remember in new and vital ways”, Comment). Good for them: to pay attention to all those who made such a remarkable film is to acknowledge their part in the achievement. The many names on screen do not, however, include a single one of the cameramen who originally took the film on which Jackson and his team have worked their digital magic. It is an astonishing omission. Without Geoffrey Malins, JB McDowell and the dozen or so other “official kinematographers” from Britain and the Dominions who filmed on the western front between 1915 and 1918, They Shall Not Grow Old would not exist. They, more than anyone, deserve recognition. Roger Smither London SE22 School cuts fail my daughter The effect of funding cuts for children with learning difficulties (“‘Devastating’ cuts hit special educational needs”, News) is that these children are either shoehorned into an increasingly “one-size-fits-all” mainstream educational setting, or they are ferried for miles across the county to an ever-declining number of special schools. We chose to keep our daughter, who has complex needs and intractable epilepsy, in the mainstream. But this year, in order to sustain itself, her school has had to lose learning support assistants, at a time when subjects such as music, dance, food tech and PE are being driven out of the curriculum by government reforms, or made so academic that they are inaccessible to children like her (and thousands more). Children with mild/moderate learning difficulties are simply not accommodated by the secondary education system that Michael Gove and years of austerity have shaped – and the effects on their self-esteem, mental health and future prospects can be catastrophic. Rachel Bladon Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire So much for US democracy Your excellent analysis of the US midterm elections (“Trump at bay but now more dangerous than ever”, Editorial) leads to only one conclusion: democracy in that country has failed and the Republican party is now a toxic institution. America was founded by a group of rich, white, slave-owning tax-dodgers. It was then built on slavery and discrimination and the slaughter of some two million natives. The Federalist Papers make it clear that the primary intention of those plutocratic founding fathers was to protect their numerically endangered clique from the rest. The result is a nation in thrall to a constitution still stuck largely in the 18th century and an election game where entrenched elites hold all the high cards and make all the rules. The “shining city on a hill”? No. A democratic swamp, allowing the perfect place for monsters such as Trump to evolve. Steve Edwards Wivelsfield Green, Haywards Heath, West Sussex Watchful eye on DNA debate Your science editor Robin McKie’s coverage of the new documentary Three Identical Strangers does great service to those keeping a watchful eye on the re-emerging nature-nurture debate (“What makes us… nature or nurture?”, Special Report). The many implications of this are partially reflected in the adoption into common parlance of the somewhat irritating phrase “It’s in our DNA”, and in recently reported “secret” eugenics conferences at University College London. McKie’s very proper highlighting of the far right’s attempted accretion unto itself of the tenets of genetic determinism is surely more than sufficient justification for the press’s continuing watchdog role respecting future developments in this highly contentious field. Steve Williams Peacehaven, East Sussex Reef encounter You report that “children born today may be the last generation to see coral reefs in all their glory” (News, last week). Such direct experience is mostly restricted to those with the leisure and resources for travel, which will often be long-haul. Yet that very travel is a significant contributor to the global warming that threatens the reefs’ existence.

In late July 1978, Kaoru Hasuike and his girlfriend, Yukiko Okudo, walked several hundred metres along the sand, making sure to avoid a group of rowdy drinkers. After finding a quiet spot, they sat side by side to watch the sun set over the Sea of Japan. Hasuike, then a 20-year-old law student, lit a cigarette as he and Okudo, a company employee two years his senior, chatted and admired the view. Seconds later, a man approached from behind and asked, in accented Japanese, to borrow his lighter. Two other men appeared, restraining Okudo and punching Hasuike after he resisted. As soon as the coastline was in darkness, the couple were bundled on to a small boat and taken to a fishing trawler moored offshore. “At first I thought that my girlfriend was going to be raped and that I would be killed,” Hasuike says, standing close to the spot where their ordeal began 41 years ago. “I was paralysed with fear.” Hasuike and Okudo were injected with a sedative, placed inside sleeping bags and kept in the boat’s hold. Two days later, they arrived in North Korea, the victims of the communist regime’s ambitious plans to create a cold war network of spies that would operate in Japan, its hated former colonial ruler. The couple married in North Korea in 1980 and returned to Japan in 2002 after the regime’s then leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted the country had abducted more than a dozen Japanese citizens to teach their language and customs to Pyongyang agents. Now Hasuike, 61, believes North Korea’s emergence as a nuclear power and talks between its ambitious leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, offer the best hope yet of the return of abductees Japan believes are still in North Korea. Japan’s government lists 17 people as having been abducted by North Korea during the 70s and 80s, including five from Niigata prefecture, whose coastline is just over 500 miles from North Korea. They include Megumi Yokota, a 13-year-old schoolgirl who was snatched as she walked home from after-school badminton practice in 1977. Five abductees, including Hasuike and Okudo, were allowed to return to Japan after a landmark summit in Pyongyang between Kim and the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Kim apologised for the abductions but his officials insisted that eight victims had died, most in a series of bizarre accidents and that four others had never entered North Korea. Yokota, they claimed, had killed herself in a psychiatric hospital in the early 1990s. But Japan’s government and the victims’ families refuse to believe that they are dead, citing forged death certificates and sightings of victims after they had supposedly died. DNA tests on remains North Korea claimed were those of Yokota were found to belong to people unrelated to the abductions. Her younger brother, Takuya Yokota, is convinced that the North is holding his sister and other Japanese citizens hostage because they know too much about the regime. “My parents are in their 80s and my father is chronically ill in hospital,” said Yokota, who heads an association of families whose members were abducted by North Korea. “They’ve waited more than 40 years to see their daughter. I won’t stop until she is back. I would welcome her home, but the first words I would say to her are ‘I’m sorry’.” Trump has reportedly raised the abductions in two of his three meetings with Kim. Hasuike, though, believes a breakthrough will come only after the leaders have made substantial progress on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme, paving the way for a meeting between Kim and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Abe, a hardliner on North Korea, insists that normalising diplomatic ties and providing Japanese aid are contingent on a resolution of the abduction issue. After his arrival in North Korea, Hasuike, an associate professor of Korean language and culture at Niigata Sangyo University, was initially trained to become an agent, undergoing daily instruction in the Korean language and the regime’s ideology. His apprenticeship ended when two women abducted from Lebanon who had been trained as agents escaped while on assignment in Yugoslavia, prompting the regime to concede that its plan to build a global network of spies carried too many risks. Hasuike was then enlisted to teach Japanese to spies, but that programme ended when a suspect in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner revealed she had been taught Japanese by a woman thought to be an abducted Japanese citizen, Yaeko Taguchi. The truth of the regime’s abductions was out. Hasuike spent his final years in North Korea translating articles from Japanese newspapers and magazines. He and Yukiko, who now works at a kindergarten, had a son and a daughter in North Korea. Now in their 30s, their children joined them in Japan in 2004 and have “come to terms” with their parents’ past, he says.

They were clearly a nice couple of pints. A year later the Chinese investment firm SinoFortone bought the 16th-century pub for £2m, and announced plans (which have not yet materialised) to build 100 replica pubs across China. And, this week, the family of Hong Kong’s richest person, Li Ka-shing, bought out all of Greene King including 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels for £2.7bn. Pubs are just a tiny part of a wave of cash flooding to the UK from China and Hong Kong, as the Chinese state and the region’s super-rich take advantage of the collapse in the value of pound to buy up everything from luxury homes, skyscrapers such as London’s Walkie Talkie and Cheesegrater, a third of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, private schools and Pizza Express. The Chinese super-rich also either own or have big stakes in Southampton, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion and Reading football clubs. The famous Wentworth golf course is owned by the Thai-Chinese billionaire Chanchai Ruayrungruang, one of Asia’s richest men with an estimated $11bn (£9bn) fortune. Wang Jianlin, China’s wealthiest man, owns the luxury yacht maker Sunseeker. Chinese companies have made 15 big acquisitions in the UK so far this year, spending £6.75bn ($8.3bn) – already more than the $6bn spent on 23 deals last year. Angus Knowles-Cutler, Deloitte’s vice-chair and the head of its China Services Group, said he expected Chinese people to spend more on both UK homes and businesses whatever the outcome of Brexit. Knowles-Cutler, who visits China four or five times a year, said: “They invest more in the UK than elsewhere, and I think that will increase if anything. The UK is seen as very cheap now. “When they look at the UK they think of all the things we are good at. They look at the UK as a small island and wonder how it is that we have the second-highest Nobel prizes [after the US] and came second in the 2016 Olympics [with 27 gold medals, behind the US with 46 and just ahead of China with 26]”. Knowles-Cutler said key items on Chinese shopping lists were education, intellectual property and branded goods that could be taken back to China and sold at scale to the country’s booming middle classes. There are 109 million middle-class people in China compared with 92 million in the US, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Among the UK firms sold to the Chinese or facing takeover bids so far this year: The money transfer company WorldFirst was sold to Ant Financial, reportedly for £520m. The billionaire Zhang Lei’s Hillhouse Capital picked up Loch Lomond Distillers for £400m. The Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, which was founded by the Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, owns Wolves FC and is in talks to buy the 178-year-old package holiday operator Thomas Cook. Other firms considered to be at risk of a takeover include the supermarket Morrisons and the Premier Inn owner Whitbread. Chinese state-owned railway constructors and operators are also being tapped up to help deliver HS2, if the high-speed project gets the go-ahead. The chief executive of HS2, Mark Thurston, flew to Beijing recently to discuss China’s offer to provide “a wholesale package to build” the £55.7bn network. Knowles-Cutler said he expected British technology companies to also be targeted by Chinese money as the country concentrates on its “Made in China 2025” vision to move away from being the world’s factory and instead design and manufacture more of its own high-value products and services. He said: “They want to be the leaders in electric cars and green technology, they’re very interested in next generation materials and robotics. People have a tendency to look to the US for future business models, but I believe we should look to China for the future of the digital economy.” Chinese companies are also looking at buying up more of the UK’s private schools. Harrow and Dulwich College have long-established Chinese outposts, five UK schools opened up in China last year and another nine are expected this year. This summer Bright Scholar, the largest operator of international and bilingual schools in China and majority-owned by the billionaire Yeung Kwok-keung, bought CATS colleges for £150m. It said the purchase of CATS – which owns day and boarding schools in Cambridge, London, Canterbury and Shanghai – was part of its aim to build a “global network of premium schools”. Ed Ratcliffe, the head of Asia House Advisory, a consultancy that advises Chinese companies on UK investments, said: “A lot of people in China want to get their money out, and the UK is seen as one of the best locations because of our strong legal system and protections. Their money will be neutral once it’s in the UK, and safe if the Chinese government changes its policies.” • This article was amended on 27 August 2019 because WorldFirst was sold to Ant Financial, not Alibaba as an earlier version said.

National Grid, which runs the UK’s national electricity network, said its profit for the 12 months to 31 March was down by nearly a third from £2.7bn the year before. It wrote off £137m of costs spent to connect two nuclear UK projects in Cumbria and Wales that were cancelled, and also took a financial hit from a seven-month labour dispute at its US business. Mounting a staunch defence against Labour’s proposals to renationalise the FTSE 100 company, John Pettigrew, the chief executive, described them as a huge distraction. He indicated that nationalising power networks could lead to higher costs, which would be passed on to consumers, who pay for energy transmission through their utility bills. “It’s very clear that it will not either accelerate the decarbonisation agenda in the UK, not will it result in lower costs for customers. It will delay the decarbonisation in the UK and potentially increase costs for customers.” National Grid became a commercial business in 1990 when the UK’s electricity industry was privatised. It listed on the London stock exchange five years later. Pettigrew said when he started out in the industry 30 years ago, there was “slow decision making, bureaucracy and it felt like Yes Minister”. He added: “You need operations that are nimble and can make decisions quickly.” He said the UK had a world-class energy network and stressed that National Grid was ramping up investment to £5bn a year, from £4.5bn last year. It is putting £2.2bn into interconnectors – transmission cables for electricity to other countries – and 90% of the energy delivered by them will be clean. Labour argues that taking the companies that control the UK’s £62bn energy infrastructure back into state ownership is key to decarbonising the economy, and would end the rip-off of customers, with shareholders paid £13bn in dividends over the past five years. Nationalisation would affect National Grid and the network arms of Scottish Power and SSE, which control the pipes and cables that supply homes and businesses with gas and electricity. Labour and consumer groups have criticised National Grid and other energy infrastructure firms for making big profits and paying out large sums to shareholders, while consumers pay for the cost of maintaining the network through their bills. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow business and energy secretary, said about National Grid’s results: “These figures speak for themselves … As a country we face a huge challenge to rapidly decarbonise our energy system while bringing costs down for households – and we simply cannot afford to continue with a privatised monopoly that puts the public at such a structural disadvantage.” National Grid paid £1.2bn in dividends to shareholders last year. Pettigrew acknowledged that the regulatory environment would get tougher. Ofgem wants to reduce the amount of cash which is flowing into the pockets of shareholders, by setting the rate of return paid to investors at 3% to 5%, rather than the current 7%. However, National Grid argues that a fair return would be 5.5%. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Statutory profit is down markedly, returns on equity are under pressure and the company is hit by a write-off relating to cancelled nuclear power plants. “At least the inflation-protected dividend is intact and reassuringly the company has renewed its commitment to grow the payout in line with RPI inflation going forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/feb/03/boris-johnson-latest-news-partygate-covid-coronavirus-cost-of-living-crisis-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-03T23:49:29Z","webTitle":"Two more senior Boris Johnson aides resign amid Downing Street exodus – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/feb/03/boris-johnson-latest-news-partygate-covid-coronavirus-cost-of-living-crisis-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/feb/03/boris-johnson-latest-news-partygate-covid-coronavirus-cost-of-living-crisis-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Two more senior Boris Johnson aides resign amid Downing Street exodus – as it happened","bodyText":"The blog is closing now, but read our full story of the day’s developments here: Four of Boris Johnson’s aides have resigned today. Johnson’s longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza was the first to go, using a stinging resignation letter to accuse the prime minister of “scurrilous” behaviour when he falsely linked Keir Starmer to the failure to bring paedophile Jimmy Savile to justice. Jack Doyle then resigned as director of communications at Downing Street. Dan Rosenfield, Boris Johnson’s chief of staff and Martin Reynolds, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, resigned later in the evening. The latter has been thrust into the spotlight after it emerged he sent an email inviting more than 100 Downing Street staff to a drinks party in May 2020. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has accused Russia of “unprovoked aggression and underhand activity” to destabilise Ukraine following reports of a plan by Moscow to fabricate a pretext for an invasion using a faked video. The Northern Ireland first minister, Paul Givan, announced his resignation from Stormont’s power-sharing Executive. The move by the Lagan Valley MLA is part of the DUP’s escalating protest strategy against Brexit’s Northern Ireland protocol. Rishi Sunak responded to the prime minister’s attempt to smear Starmer by saying: “With regard to the comments, being honest, I wouldn’t have said it and I’m glad that the prime minister clarified what he meant.” The chancellor also had his say on partygate and what would happen on “his watch”. In an opinion piece for the Sun, he wrote: “We have always been the party of sound money — we will always continue to be on my watch — and that is the only kind of party I am interested in.” Friday’s Guardian front page: Tomorrow’s Times front page: A selection of some of Friday’s front pages beginning with the Mail: Rishi Sunak has also rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies making profits while customers struggle to pay rising bills. The chancellor told the Martin Lewis Money Show such a levy would “deter investment”. Lewis asked him: “People have said … why the hell are they having to pay money back when energy companies are publishing – the big ones – record profits?” Sunak said a windfall tax “does sound superficially appealing”, but added: “I don’t think a windfall tax is the right thing to do, most obviously because it will deter investment.” He said more investment was needed in the North Sea, which he claimed would help to boost the economy and employment levels. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has had his say on partygate and what would happen on “his watch”. In an opinion piece for the Sun, he wrote: “We have always been the party of sound money — we will always continue to be on my watch — and that is the only kind of party I am interested in.” Conservative MP Chris Loder gives his forthright reaction to the four resignations this evening. Here is more from ITV’s Robert Peston on the motives behind the shakeup. Outgoing communications director Jack Doyle gave a resignation speech to staff in No 10, according to the Daily Mail. The newspaper reported Doyle said “recent weeks have taken a terrible toll on my family life”, but that he always intended to resign after two years in the role. The former Daily Mail journalist has been accused of attending at least two of the 12 social gatherings during lockdown that are under investigation by the police.

The FT’s Sebastian Payne discloses a new nickname for one of Johnson’s advisers. ITV’s Robert Peston gives his reaction to the spate of resignations this evening which he believes have been prompted by Boris Johnson following the fallout from the partygate scandal. Here is the confirmation from Downing Street that both Martin Reynolds and Dan Rosenfield have resigned. A No 10 spokesperson said: Dan Rosenfield offered his resignation to the prime minister earlier today, which has been accepted. Martin Reynolds also informed the prime minister of his intention to stand down from his role as principal private secretary and the prime minister has agreed to this. He has thanked them both for their significant contribution to government and No 10, including work on the pandemic response and economic recovery. They will continue in their roles while successors are appointed, and recruitment for both posts is underway. It has also been confirmed that Reynolds will be returning to the Foreign Office. Several journalists are now citing sources telling them that Dan Rosenfield and Martin Reynolds are also set to resign from their posts at Downing Street tonight. Rosenfield is Boris Johnson’s chief of staff, while Martin Reynolds is the prime minister’s principal private secretary. The latter has been thrust into the spotlight recently after it emerged he sent an email inviting more than 100 Downing Street staff to a drinks party in May 2020. The Telegraph’s Whitehall editor Harry Yorke has tweeted. And some more detail from Steven Swinford, of The Times. Civil service bosses may never know which of their staff are fined by police for attending Covid rule-breaking parties, a leaked memo issued by the Cabinet Office has revealed. The five-page advice document for those who could be spoken to by Scotland Yard over 12 alleged gatherings also reassured staff it was “unlikely” their security clearance would be revoked if they were issued with a £100 fixed penalty notice. Whitehall workers were told to “cooperate fully” with the Metropolitan police, and that while there was no fixed end point to officers’ inquiries they would be kept “updated as timelines become clearer”. Advice was given for people to join a union to get legal support – if they wanted it – while those who wanted “time off” to handle the stress of the investigation were told they would be supported “through this difficult period” and given “flexibility”. More than 70 witnesses were interviewed by senior civil servant Sue Gray’s team, as part of her investigation into a string of alleged parties in No 10 and across Whitehall when Covid restrictions were in place. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has accused Russia of “unprovoked aggression and underhand activity” to destabilise Ukraine following reports of a plan by Moscow to fabricate a pretext for an invasion using a faked video. The New York Times reported that US had acquired intelligence about the Russian plan which involved staging and filming a fabricated attack by the Ukrainian military either on Russian territory or against Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine. In a statement posted on Twitter, Truss said: “This is clear and shocking evidence of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine. “This bellicose intent towards a sovereign democratic country is completely unacceptable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.” Families are facing the biggest fall in disposable income for three decades, according to the Bank of England, with rising energy prices and other consumer inflation hitting incomes. The government has responded to the cost of living crisis with the announcement of a package of measures. Here is a handy look at the impact on a range of different people. “To be honest, I wouldn’t have said it.” Rishi Sunak’s blunt remark about Boris Johnson’s comments on Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile was the clearest indication yet that he is distancing himself from his beleaguered boss. Speaking in the flag-bedecked Downing Street conference room without Johnson alongside him, Sunak was attempting to set out in soothing tones a package of measures aimed at easing the pain of the cost of living crisis. But, as ever in recent weeks, another crisis – that facing the prime minister’s leadership – impinged on proceedings. Less than an hour earlier, Johnson’s close aide Munira Mirza had resigned, citing the prime minister’s failure to apologise for trying to smear Starmer by falsely connecting him with the failure to prosecute Savile. Pressed on whether Johnson should give a full apology for the remarks, as Mirza had asked, Sunak repeatedly replied it was a matter for Johnson himself. Sunak didn’t say much. He didn’t have to. The comments are bound to be read by some of his colleagues as the strongest signal yet he may believe it is now time to act. And to read exactly what the chancellor said, as well as his comments with regard to the energy price rise crisis, here is the full story below. The Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, has said Boris Johnson’s behaviour is “bad by any measure”. He also said that he is “waiting” to see if he can continue supporting the prime minister in his role. In comments reported by the Birmingham Mail, he commented: What he’s done, very clearly, is wrong. It’s bad by any measure. And I find it very hard to understand how on earth it could have happened. So I can’t be happy with it in any way. However, he has apologised. He appears to me to be a man who is genuine in that apology. You can see that from his demeanour. But what we’ve now got to see is that this apology follows through in terms of actions, how he leads and what is done within Downing Street to make it very, very different. The honest answer is that we are waiting to see if he follows through on what he’s now said. My colleague Peter Walker has more detail on the news that Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and the Home Office have been rebuked for quoting misleading crime statistics (see 18.02). He reports: The head of the official statistics watchdog has reprimanded Boris Johnson and the Home Office for incorrectly saying crime has fallen by 14%, when this excludes the fastest-rising category of crime. Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, said he would be writing to the offices of Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, to highlight what he called a “misleading” use of statistics. Replying to a letter about the claims from Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Norgrove said Johnson and Patel had been incorrect to claim that crime was falling. A Home Office press release from last week twice “presented the statistics to give a positive picture of trends in crime in England and Wales” between June 2019 and September 2021, but did so by not including fraud and computer misuse, he wrote. See the full story by clicking the link below. The government has admitted it is spending £4.7m a day on accommodating refugees from Afghanistan and other asylum seekers in hotels, a figure four times the amount previously stated. Refugee organisations criticised the Home Office for the slow progress it has made towards finding permanent homes for refugees brought to the UK from Afghanistan last year. Campaigners have consistently warned that, aside from the cost, hotels are inappropriate places to house families long-term. The Home Office was forced to clarify the cost of the policy, after deputy permanent secretary Tricia Hayes told the home affairs select committee on Wednesday that a total of £1.2m was being spent every day on hotel accommodation. The department said on Thursday that that figure actually only covered the 12,000 people being resettled after being airlifted out of Kabul. Another £3.5m a day is spent on housing another 25,000 asylum seekers. The home secretary, Priti Patel, admitted this week that the government was “absolutely struggling” to find accommodation for 12,000 people from Afghanistan who remain in hotels almost six months after being evacuated last August. If you missed it earlier today, the Northern Ireland first minister, Paul Givan, announced his resignation from Stormont’s power-sharing Executive. The move by the Lagan Valley MLA is part of the DUP’s escalating protest strategy against Brexit’s Northern Ireland protocol, the PA Media news agency reported. Givan said the protocol, which has created trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, had undermined a cornerstone of power-sharing in the region - governance with the consent of both nationalists and unionists. He said: Today marks the end of what has been the privilege of my lifetime - to serve as the first minister of Northern Ireland. When I first entered the Assembly 12 years ago, I never expected to have the opportunity to lead the government and serve the people of Northern Ireland as first minister. His announcement comes 24 hours after DUP agriculture minister Edwin Poots acted unilaterally to order a halt to agri-food checks required under the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, commented: The decision by the DUP to withdraw the first minister from the Northern Ireland executive is extremely disappointing. I urge them to reinstate the first minister immediately to ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland. The UK government’s priority is to see a strong functioning Northern Ireland executive delivering a better, more prosperous, shared future for all the people of Northern Ireland. We want to continue to build on the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement’s promise of a stable, cooperative and respectful power-sharing executive. Jack Doyle has resigned as director of communications at Downing Street, according to the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves. He reports that Doyle had always planned to step down after two years and is not linked to Munira Mirza’s resignation earlier today. However, the timing of this latest resignation could not come at a worse time amid a police investigation into parties during lockdown at No 10 and mounting pressure on an increasingly beleaguered prime minister. Doyle reportedly told staff at No 10: “It was always my intention to do two years. Recent weeks have taken a terrible toll on my family life. “Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I wish you all the best for the future.” Groves has reported the news on Twitter tonight. Here are more details. Some breaking news from the journalist Danny Shaw on Twitter. He is reporting that Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and the Home Office have been “rebuked” by the UK Statistics Authority chair, David Norgrove, for misleading use of crime figures after claiming offences had fallen when they actually increased. Here are the tweets, in which he says Norgrove said he has written to Johnson and Patel’s respective offices after a complaint to the authority was made by the Liberal Democrats. A final question from PA Media for Rishi Sunak, as he is asked why households aren’t be given the opportunity to delay payments on national insurance. The chancellor replies: “I think they are two very different things. We are putting in place a new dedicated health and social care levy so that people can feel reassured that every pound of that is going to the thing that they care most about, which is the NHS. “And it means we can make a start on tackling the backlogs as quickly as possible. “But where we can make a difference on these energy prices, we are and part of that is to smooth the impact of [rising bills].” That’s it from the chancellor’s press conference as he leaves the podium. The chancellor is now being asked if he would welcome a full apology from Boris Johnson over his smears against the Labour leader Keir Starmer. Sunak says he has nothing further to add on the matter. Lucy Fisher, of the Daily Telegraph, asks if there will come a point where Sunak will have to step in and say “people are paying too much tax”. Sunak says that the announcements today will make a difference to people’s lives, the national living wage is set to go up in April to £9.50 an hour, as well as “tax cuts” for people on universal credit. “Of course there are challenges but we are doing things to help people … we are making sure we are addressing the other thing that they care about which is having an NHS which is well funded and can make sure they don’t wait years and years for the treatment they desperately want for them and their families,” he replies. He says his mission is to cut taxes over the remainder of this parliament but falls back on saying that we have gone through a “once in 300-year economic shock”. The Daily Mail’s Jason Groves asks the chancellor why Sunak is still supporting the PM in the wake of the Sue Gray report update on ‘partygate’. Sunak says: “I think he was right to say what he said in parliament recently and before. He has apologised for that and said he is going to fix it. “He has acknowledged all of the recommendations from Sue Gray’s report and you can expect to hear more from him, as he said, about the changes he plans to make. “That’s why he has my support and I’m glad that he’s doing what he’s doing.” Sunak is now asked if he can promise to “do what it takes” to help people, as he said during the pandemic. “I absolutely recognise this is a difficult time,” Sunak replies. “I know this is probably the number one issue on most families minds, they’re looking at the news, they’re seeing prices go up, they’re worried about the cost of living and that’s why we are taking action.” He adds: “£350 is a significant amount of money that will make a big difference to the vast majorities of households and I hope actually people will be reassured by us stepping in to provide that support.” Peston also quizzes Sunak over Mirza’s resignation letter comments and asserts that Johnson hasn’t in fact apologised. He asks if he should say sorry. “It’s a question for the prime minister rather than me and there’s probably not much more I can add other than what I have already said, which I hope you can appreciate,” he says. ITV’s Robert Peston has asked the chancellor why he isn’t helping just the poorest in society when it comes to tackling rising energy bills “if you believe in levelling up”. Sunak replies: “Of course there are choices we have to make when we are designing a policy like this - my view was that the price rise is so significant that it’s not just those families on benefits that are going to feel the pinch, it actually [is] middle income families as well.” He rather tellingly goes on to define middle income families as “families that are working hard, that are not on welfare”. “That’s why we have decided to go to bands A to D … to help those families in the middle as well. That’s a deliberate choice.” Sunak is asked to respond to the breaking news we have brought you this afternoon about Boris Johnson’s policy chief Munira Mirza resigning over the prime minister’s attempt to smear Keir Starmer in the House of Commons. Johnson made a false accusation that Starmer had failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile during his time running the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). “With regard to the comments, being honest, I wouldn’t have said it and I’m glad that the prime minister clarified what he meant,” Sunak says. He also paid tribute to Mirza and said he will miss working with her. The chancellor has been asked if high energy prices are here to stay and whether he would rule out having to help out with rebate schemes again further down the line. He says: “The factors that are driving gas prices higher are global in their nature ... I don’t have a crystal ball as to what the future holds but I want to be honest with people. “Higher energy prices are something we will have to adjust to, in common with other countries around the world and it would be wrong to pretend otherwise but what we can do is slow that adjustment to make it more manageable for people’s household budgets.” He admits energy bills could rise again in October but says the rebate will kick in then and help with that. He goes on to say the government will pay a “council tax rebate” of £150 to all households in bands A to D - around four in five households in England. Sunak says: “[This] is the quickest way to get money to the families that need it.” The rebate will be paid in April and won’t need to be repaid, he adds. “Our plan is right, it is fair and I hope it will help ease the anxiety that millions of people feel about rising energy costs by sharing the burden between us all,” he concludes. Rishi Sunak has started speaking and has set out the reason why the government is stepping in on the energy prices crisis. He says: “There is in truth nothing the British government can do about a nuclear power plant going offline in Europe or a factory in China deciding to produce more goods. “But what we can do is take the sting out of the price shock as we and the world adjust to high energy prices.” He says that without government intervention, the average UK household would need to find an additional £693 next year. “That is clearly a very significant sum,” he says. He announces an “energy bills rebate” worth £350. The cash support will be received through an upfront £200 discount for all electricity customers - automatically repaid from bills over the next five years in instalments of £40-a-year starting next April. Good afternoon. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be with you over the next couple of hours to bring you the latest from Westminster and UK politics. There will, of course, be more reaction to the resignation of Boris Johnson’s policy chief Munira Mirza over the prime minister’s attempt to smear the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, in a House of Commons debate this week. But first I’ll be bringing you details of anything that may emerge from Rishi Sunak’s 5pm press conference, where it is expected he will set out the government’s plans to tackle to cost of living crisis. Stay tuned to follow along live here. Here is some more reaction to the resignation of Munira Mirza. From Paul Goodman, editor of ConservativeHome From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From Sky’s Beth Rigby From Nikki de Costa, former head of legislative affairs at No 10 for Theresa May and Boris Johnson That’s all from me for today. My colleague Tom Ambrose is taking over now. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says it is always the women around Boris Johnson who seem to take responsibility for his misconduct. The most prominent example is Allegra Stratton, who resigned as his spokesperson on Cop26 after a film of her joking about a lockdown-busting party at a private rehearsal briefing was leaked. Stratton said in the recording she did not even attend the party. The only other person linked to government who has been punished so far in relation to No 10 parties is Kate Josephs, who was head of the government’s Covid taskforce when she attended a leaving drinks do in December 2020. She is now on paid leave from her new job as chief executive of Sheffield city council pending an investigation. From the BBC’s Laura Kunessberg Boris Johnson has appointed Andrew Griffith MP, his parliamentary private secretary, as the new head of his policy unit, replacing Munira Mirza. Griffith was a senior executive at Sky before becoming at the last general election. He has been Johnson’s business adviser, and he lent Johnson use of his £10m Westminster townhouse during the 2019 leadership campaign. In a statement a No 10 spokesperson said: We are very sorry Munira has left No 10 and are grateful for her service and contribution to government. Andrew Griffith MP has been appointed Head of the No 10 Policy Unit and will work across government and with MPs as we continue to deliver and expand on our ambitious policy agenda. These are from Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser turned mortal foe, on the resignation of Munira Mirza. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story about Munira Mirza’s resignation. Munira Mirza has resigned as Boris Johnson’s head of policy over his Jimmy Savile smear about Keir Starmer, the Spectator’s James Forsyth reports. In a blog on the Spectator’s website, Forsyth has published Mirza’s resignation letter in full. Here’s an extract. I believe it was wrong for you to imply this week that Keir Starmer was personally responsible for allowing Jimmy Savile to escape justice. There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the normal cut-and-thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse. You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave. Mirza has been working for Johnson since he was mayor of London and he once described her as one of the five women who inspired him most. In her letter Mirza says Johnson is “a better man than many of your detractors will ever understand” and that she still hopes he will apologise. She says she was hoping he would apologise today (he didn’t - see 1.38pm) and she implies that it was his failure to say sorry in his interview earlier, despite her telling him he should, that tipped her over the edge. The UK government is not doing anything to stop the DUP wing of the Northern Ireland executive trying to halt the checks on goods entering Northern Ireland. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, has described this as a matter for the executive. Downing Street took the same line at lobby this morning (see 12.28pm) and in a statement to MPs George Eustice, the environment secretary (the relevant checks relate to agrigoods), said UK government intervention was “entirely unnecessary at this stage”. He also said the checks were continuing, despite the order given by the DUP agriculture minister in Belfast, Edwin Poots, because the relevant officials were taking their own legal advice. Peter Kyle, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, accused the government of standing by while their own deal fell apart. He said: The protocol was signed into international law by the UK government, and now they are bystanders as their deal falls apart - pathetically claiming it’s all someone else’s responsibility. Just think of the implications: Is the message that the Welsh senedd or Scottish parliament can break international law too and the government will have nothing to say about it? In his statement to the Commons earlier Edward Argar, the health minister, said he was making no apology for the government having to write off almost £9bn spent on PPE during the pandemic. He told MPs: We make no apology for procuring PPE at the pace and volume we did based on the information we had at the time. The action we took protected thousands of frontline healthcare workers in the NHS and social care. However, now that the world market for PPE has stabilised, the value of some categories of goods is now inevitably much lower than the price they were originally purchased for. Some Tories believe that the MPs hoping to trigger a no confidence vote in Boris Johnson are close to getting the 54 letters they need, the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports. MPs who want a vote have to write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, calling for one, but they can do so privately. Only 11 of them have publicly said they have submitted a letter, according to this tally. And here are two more lines from the broadcast interview Boris Johnson gave on his visit this morning. Johnson said the current implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol was “crazy” and renewed his call for a “common sense” solution. Referring to the talks with the EU about how the protocol could be revised, he said: What we’ve got to do is get to a sensible solution that recognises it’s crazy to have checks on goods that are basically circulating within the single market of the United Kingdom. What you could have, of course, is a common-sensical ... practical steps to weed out, to check on things that might be at risk of circulation, as they say in Brussels, are at risk of circulation in Ireland, as well as Northern Ireland. Now we can do that, but without having a full panoply of checks on the GB/NI coast and at the airport, and that’s the way forward. I think practical common sense is what’s needed. Asked if that meant he was going back on the protocol that he agreed with the EU, which requires the checks he calls “crazy”, Johnson replied: Actually, if you look at the protocol, which I’m sure you have studied in detail, there’s plenty about uninterrupted east-west trade. He said the UK had been “way out in front” in backing Ukraine in the face of the threat from Russia. He said: The UK has played a very good role so far in bringing together the west and making sure that our partners understand the severity of the threat that Ukrainians face. And if you look at what we’ve been doing for the last two or three months, the UK has been way out in front in making sure that people respond. National Energy Action, the fuel poverty charity, has said that it expects Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, to have to unveil further support measures later this year because today’s energy bills package is “woefully inadequate”. Adam Scorer, its chief executive, said: These energy crisis measures are woefully inadequate and will leave those on the lowest incomes and in the least efficient homes in deep peril. We needed deep, targeted support for the most vulnerable. We have shallow, broad measures for all. That simply does not work. The depth of support is not proportionate to the increases. A household paying by prepayment will still have a £500 increase when you take into account rises from October 2021 and April 2022. The rebates on bills and council tax are not sufficiently targeted, too small and too complex. We expect the government will have no choice but to return to the issue of spiralling fuel poverty and another price rise later this year. By then they’ll be playing catch-up and great harm will already have been done. One of the MPs most critical of the energy bills support package announced by Rishi Sunak in the Commons earlier was Labour’s Chris Bryant. He told Sunak the £350 offer was nothing like enough to help his constituents. He explained: I know the chancellor is all pumped up but this is pretty puny stuff to be honest – £350 isn’t going to touch the sides of the problem for my constituents in Rhondda. Gas and electricity up for the average family in my constituency by £686. Fuel up by £314. The average weekly shop up by £385 [a year]. Universal credit cut by £1,040. National Insurance up by £150 and frozen tax allowances by him will cost another £300. That’s £2,875 in a constituency where the average wage is £27,000. That’s really going to cause hardships; £350 does not even touch it. Boris Johnson has finally admitted that Keir Starmer was not personally responsible for any decisions taken not to prosecute the paedophile, sexual predator and TV personality Jimmy Savile. On Monday, in response to a withering speech from Starmer telling him that he was not fit to be PM, Johnson retaliated by saying that Starmer “spent most of his time [as DPP] prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. This was widely seen as a smear, because Johnson was implying that Starmer was to blame for the failure to prosecute Savile when he wasn’t, and because it was redolent of an online conspiracy theory saying Starmer protected Savile from prosecution. Some of the Tory MPs calling for Johnson’s resignation this week have cited this comment as an example of why is is not a suitable person to be PM. In an interview today Johnson said: I want to be very clear about this because a lot of people have got very hot under the collar, and I understand why. Let’s be absolutely clear, I’m talking not about the leader of the opposition’s personal record when he was DPP and I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions. I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole. And I think people can see that. And I really do want to clarify that because it is important. This is similar to the argument advanced by James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, who said that Johnson was trying to compare Starmer’s situation at the CPS over Savile with Johnson’s position in relation to partygate. (See 10.46am.) But it has taken Johnson a while to issue this clarification. On Tuesday he told the Sun that what he said about Starmer was “fairly accurate”, in a comment interpreted by the paper as Johnson doubling down on his original claim. And in the Commons yesterday, when Starmer accused him of parroting a conspiracy theory favoured by fascists, Johnson just said: “I do not want to make heavy weather of this, but I am informed that in 2013 [Starmer] apologised and took full responsibility for what had happened on his watch, and I think that was the right thing to do.” Johnson did not say at that point he accepted that Starmer was not personally involved in the Savile decisions. The Bank of England is today warning that families are facing the biggest fall in disposable incomes for three decades, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. He writes: The Bank of England fears that UK families are about to suffer the biggest fall in living standards since comparable records began three decades ago. Its new forecasts now show that disposable incomes (post-tax labour income, after inflation) will shrink by 2% this year, and by another 0.5% in 2023. That would be the biggest annual reduction in spending power since at least 1990. There is much more on Graeme’s business live blog. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, and a former energy secretary, said (like Labour) that the government should be imposing a windfall tax on energy companies to fund support measures for customers. He said: People around the country are facing an energy bill nightmare, including in the chancellor’s own backyard. But instead of taxing the record profits of oil and gas companies to fund a package of support, Rishi Sunak is simply spreading the pain for families over the coming years. These plans are playing Russian roulette with taxpayers’ money, gambling that energy prices will fall instead of investing in keeping people’s bills down. It is an insult to take £150 of a family’s council tax while hiking their taxes by an average of £600, giving with one hand while taking away more with the other. Charities and campaigning organisations that represent low-income families seem unimpressed by the energy bills rebate package announced by Rishi Sunak. This is what some of them have been saying. From Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice This is a strange, complicated and untargeted package of measures. It provides some relief for all households come April, but for people on low incomes who need it most there are far easier ways for the government to deliver support. If the government is serious about helping families facing the desperate choice between heating and eating it should use the benefits system. From Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group A day after the levelling up fanfare, the government’s piecemeal measures won’t protect low-income families either now or in the future. Surging energy prices are only the start of the crisis and what’s needed is comprehensive help with across-the-board price rises. The most efficient way to help households is to increase benefits to match inflation and anything less than a rise by at least 6% will leave families in a desperate situation. From Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children Just over 100 days ago, the families we help lost £1,000 a year in universal credit, and will now have nearly £700 a year added to their bills. The help announced for these families today won’t be enough. We’re going to see more children going hungry as parents struggle to make ends meet. From Katie Schmuecker, deputy director of policy and partnerships at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: The chancellor has offered cold comfort to families in poverty, who are already rationing what they can spend on essentials such as heating and food. These families are now expected to find at least half of the eye-watering increases in energy bills, when many are already getting into debt to keep their houses warm and food on the table. Three-quarters of those who can claim the enhanced support are not in poverty. Meanwhile, inflation is set to rise at more than double the rate of benefits. This support will not get people through the next few months and it will not protect those most at risk of hardship. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said the government was not aware that the Northern Ireland executive planned to stop the checks on goods arriving from Britain required under the Northern Ireland protocol. Asked if the PM wanted those checks to continue, he replied: Yes, we would like this situation to be resolved, recognising it is a matter for the Northern Ireland executive. At its own briefing, the European Commission said that EU observers in Northern Ireland were satisfied the required checks were still being carried out - despite Edwin Poots, the DUP agriculture minister in the Northern Ireland executive, saying they should stop. Asked if the entire Brexit trade deal with the UK could be suspended if the Northern Ireland protocol’s requirements were not met, Eric Mamer, the commission’s spokesperson, said: I’m not going to get into speculation about what we would undertake in case the checks were to stop ... for the moment our indications are that the checks are ongoing. Although the UK government claims the operation of the checks is a matter for the Northern Ireland executive, Mamer said the protocol was a deal between the UK and the EU, not between Belfast and the EU. The Bank of England has raised interest rates to 0.5% to tackle soaring inflation amid intense pressure on households in Britain’s cost of living crisis, my colleague Richard Partington reports. In his response to Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, mocked Labour by saying its call for VAT to be removed from fuel bills meant it was now converted to the benefits of Brexit (which would allow a UK government to do this). He also dismissed Labour’s call for a windfall tax on energy companies. (See 9.34am.) Although superficially attractive, that would deter investment, he said. He said the government wanted to encourage investment. He also suggests that voters would regard Labour’s stance not as “reasonable criticism” but as “political opportunism”. Here is the Treasury news release with details of the package announced by Sunak. Here is the summary of what the Treasury is calling its £9.1bn energy bills rebate package. The energy bills rebate will provide around 28 million households with an upfront discount on their bills worth £200. Energy suppliers will apply the discount to domestic electricity customers from October, with the Government meeting the costs. The discount will then be automatically recovered from people’s bills in equal £40 instalments over the next five years. This will begin from 2023, when global wholesale gas prices are expected to come down. Households in England, which are in council tax bands A-D, will also receive a £150 rebate. The rebate to bills will be made directly by local authorities from April. This will not need to be repaid. This one-off payment will benefit around 80 per cent of all homes in England and is £1 billion more generous and more targeted towards lower-income families than a VAT cut on energy bills. On top of this discount, discretionary funding of £144m will also be provided to support vulnerable people and individuals on low incomes that do not pay Council Tax, or that pay Council Tax for properties in Bands E-H. There are two Treasury factsheets here with more details about the announcement. In response, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said under Labour’s plan there would be £400 in targeted support for the poorest homes, as well as £200 in general support for most households. She said that meant the poorest families would be largely protected from the increase announced today. UPDATE: Reeves said: What do the government offer? A buy now, pay later scheme that loads up costs for tomorrow. High prices as far as the eye can see - this year, next year and the year after that, give with one hand now and take it all back later. The party opposite used to talk about the nation’s credit card, well today we’ve seen the chancellor force British households to load up their credit cards. By lending billions of pounds to energy companies, the chancellor is gambling that prices are going to fall - but they could go up further in October. What then? Billions more loaded onto people’s bills? The best way of targeting support to those who need it most would be an increase to 400 and an extension to 9 million households of the warm homes discount, as Labour has proposed today. Their scheme today is a pale imitation of Labour’s, especially for the households and pensioners on the most modest incomes. Sunak says some MPs have been arguing for VAT on fuel to be cut instead. But this would help richer households most, he says. He says there is no guarantee that this cut would be passed on to families, and he says it would become a permanent cut, at a time when the government is trying to control the public finances. UPDATE: Sunak said: I know that some in this house have argued for a VAT cut on energy, however, that policy would disproportionately benefit wealthier households. There would be no guarantee that suppliers would pass on the discount to all customers and we should be honest with ourselves - this would become a permanent government subsidy on everyone’s bills. A permanent subsidy worth £2.5bn every year at a time when we are trying to rebuild the public finances. Sunak says the eligiblity criteria for the warm homes discount (a benefit for low-income households) will be expanded so that it covers one-third more people. And he says the government is spending £3bn helping poorer families become more energy efficient. He says this could save people £290 a year. Sunak says the total package will be worth around £9bn. There will be three measures. First, all households will get a £200 discount on their bills. It will be paid from October. The money will be repaid in instalments over five years, he says. Second, people will get a £150 council tax rebate in April. This will not have to be repaid. It will not just help people on benefits. People in council tax bands A to D will benefit – around 80% of all households in England. And, third, a discretionary fund worth £150m will be available to help people in homes in higher bands who need help, he says. Sunak says the actions being announced today will provide £350 to the “vast majority of households”. That will cover just over half of the extra £693 people are having to pay because of the rise in the price cap. Sunak says it would not be sustainable to keep prices artificially low. For me to stand here and pretend we don’t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest. But what we can do is take the sting out of a significant price shock for millions of families by making sure that increase in prices is smaller initially and spread over a longer period. Sunak says the government will help people deal with energy costs. Energy bills will go up by £693 for an average household because of this morning’s Ofgem announcement on the price cap, he says. He says 80% of the increase has been driven by the rise in wholesale energy prices. Gas prices are going up for global reasons, he says. Cold weather has depleted stocks, and disruption to energy sources like nuclear and wind has led to a surge in demand. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, starts his statement to the Commons saying the recovery from the pandemic has been stronger than expected. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a former culture secretary, has announced he is standing down at the next election. Keir Starmer claimed this morning that the conduct of Boris Johnson was contributing to a decline in trust in politcians. In a speech on trust, he said: Trust in government is falling, trust in politics and politicians is falling, trust in the media is falling. Two-thirds of the public think that the way politicians act undermines democracy. Six out of 10 people think politicians are likely to lie to them - six out of 10 - sadly that doesn’t surprise me, given recent events, but it does disappoint me, it frustrates me. But honestly, I’m not surprised. It’s inevitable when we have a government that is misleading the public and covering up their own wrongdoing to save the prime minister’s job. According to the Times’ Steven Swinford, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will announce a £9bn package of loans and council tax rebates in the Commons shortly to lessen the impact of the energy bills hike. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who two weeks ago told Boris Johnson at PMQs that he should resign, told Times Radio this morning that he would consult his local party before sending a letter to the chairman of the 1922 Committee calling for a no confidence vote. “I will recommend that we send in a letter, but I will take their views first,” he said. He was also particularly critical of Johnson’s comment on Monday suggesting Keir Starmer was partly to blame for the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile. That was “not the sort of thing I would hope a prime minister would do”, Davis said. It’s like many of the tactics that No 10 have come up with, they are sort of childish and tasteless and he should just have retracted it rather than trying to justify it. Of course, Starmer did give an apology for the failure of his department, as it were, it doesn’t mean he was personally involved in the decision. Households will face a record energy bill increase of 54% from April after the regulator lifted the cap on default tariffs to £1,971, my colleague Jillian Ambrose reports. Boris Johnson’s comment in the House of Commons on Monday that Keir Starmer “spent most of his time [as DPP] prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile” was widely seen as a smear because it implied that Starmer was in some way personally responsible for the CPS’s decision not to prosecute Savile, when there is no evidence for that at all. But in an interview on the Today programme this morning James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, rejected claims that the comment amounted to a smear. Pointing out that as head of the CPS Starmer subsequently issued an apology for the “shortcomings” of the organisation in relation to the Savile case, Cleverly suggested Johnson was making a comparison between Starmer’s situation and his own. Cleverly told the programme: Keir Starmer apologised for the CPS’s failure to pursue criminal prosecutions ... Keir Starmer has said that leaders should carry the can – his words. He has apologised for the CPS’s failure to prosecute whilst he was director of public prosecutions. The point is, if the criticism that Keir Starmer is laying at the prime minister is about taking responsibility for the actions of organisations he leads ... When someone is laying criticism of the prime minister about events that went on in organisations that they run, highlighting the fact that Keir Starmer, in a position of leadership, also apologised on behalf of his organisation, also put a review in place and also drove changes, which is is exactly how the prime minister has responded to the issues raised in Sue Gray’s report ... This is the first time a minister has advanced this argument in public. Cleverly seems to be arguing that, far from smearing Starmer, Johnson was in fact expressing solidarity with him, as someone who has also had to take the rap for mistakes made by underlings. It is an ingenious argument, although marred by two flaws. First, it did not sound as if that was what Johnson was saying to anyone who heard him in the Commons on Monday. And, second, Johnson is widely seen as being at fault personally in relation to partygate, in a way that Starmer isn’t in relation to Savile. The decision by a DUP minister to halt all Brexit checks on food and animals entering Northern Ireland has been described by Ireland’s European commissioner as “an absolute breach of international law”, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. There are three statements in the Commons today, after business questions. Here is the timetable. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, takes questions on next week’s Commons business. Around 11.30am: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement on his response to rising energy bills. Around 12.30pm: Edward Argar, a health minister, makes a statement. Around 1.30pm: Victoria Prentis, an environment minister, makes a statement on Northern Ireland (where a DUP minister in the executive is trying to stop checks on food and animals going from Britain to Northern Ireland). Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has posted a thread on Twitter attacking the government’s response to the cost of living crisis. It starts here. She is particularly critical of the reported plan to offer loans to energy companies, to allow them to cut the cost of fuel bills now, but on the basis that the loans would be repaid. Paul Givan, the DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, is set to resign, leading to the probably collapse of the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive, the BBC reports. This is part of the DUP’s ongoing fight to get rid of the Northern Ireland protocol, at least in its current form. A DUP minister in the executive, Edwin Poots, has already ordered officials not to enforce the checks required under the protocol. The BBC’s Jayne McCormack has a good Twitter thread explaining the consequences of Givan’s resignation. It starts here. Good morning. While partygate has dominated the headlines for weeks, most politicians believe that the cost of living crisis is the story that will affect lives most this year and frame the battleground for the next election. And today it is bursting right to the top of the news agenda. Ofgem, the energy regulator, will this morning announce a rise in the cap on energy bills that will effectively amount to the steepest increase in the amount people pay for heating ever recorded. The announcement has been brought forward so that it can be timed to coincide with a parallel announcement from Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, about what the government is going to do to help. As Jillian Ambrose and Rowena Mason report in their overnight story, Sunak is expected to announce a series of measures, combining loans to energy companies to allow them to offer consumers discounts - a measure that should help everyone - plus targeted measures for poorer families, which are likely to involve council tax discounts and the extension of benefits that help with fuel costs. However, for most consumers, these measures are only expected to lessen the impact of rising bills; people are still expected to face soaring costs. This morning Labour has renewed its calls for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to help fund measures that would help families pay their bill. After Shell declared that 2021 had been a “momentous” year for the company as it announced its latest earning figures, Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero, said: With oil and gas profits booming in recent months because of the spike in energy prices, it is clearer than ever that the North Sea oil and gas producers who have made a fortune recently should be asked to contribute. Labour would keep energy bills low, and we wouldn’t be landing costs with bill payers as they head into a spring of higher taxes and rising prices. Our plan, part paid for with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas profits, would save most households £200 off their bills, with targeted support of up to £400 on top of that to the squeezed middle, pensioners and the lowest earners. Labour will reform our broken energy system so we deliver the green transition we need, energy security, and bills that are affordable. It was Miliband, of course, who first proposed an energy price cap when he was Labour leader in 2013. At the time the Conservatives rubbished the ideas as Marxist, but Theresa May subsequently adopted the proposal and now it is one of those policies (like the minimum wage, devolution or gay marriage) that has gone from being highly controversial to having such strong cross-party support that it is probably here for good. I shall be covering the political aspects of this story, but my colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering the business side, including the probable announcement of a rise in interest rates from the Bank of England, his business live blog. It’s here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Keir Starmer gives a speech on trust at Edelman. 10am: Tony Danker, the CBI director general, gives a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions from MPs on next week’s Commons business. 11am: Ofgem makes its announcement about the energy price cap. 11am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Around 11.30am: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs on measures to help households with the cost of living. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions in the Scottish parliament. 5pm: Sunak holds a press conference. Also, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, are on a visit in the north-west. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

My husband, Adrian, and I have been together for 32 years, so it’s very hard to surprise each other after all that time but he did! He and our teenage girls planned many surprises throughout the day and then in the evening he took me to Aqua Shard for dinner. It is on the 31st floor of the Shard, near London Bridge. The views were spectacular. We had a very private table between mirrored pillars that looked out over London. The food was delicious. It was a very good birthday indeed. 2. Film Capernaum When I saw this, luckily I knew nothing about it so I could discover the story as it unfolded. It is a beautiful film, directed and co-written by Nadine Labaki. Set in an inner city in Lebanon, it follows a young boy whose family fail to look after him, so he has to survive alone on the streets. He befriends an Ethiopian woman with a baby and when she is locked up for being an illegal immigrant, he takes care of her baby as best as he can. The story is surprising and heartbreaking. The performances are excellent – very natural and truthful. 3. Book Country of My Skull by Antjie Krog Published in 1998, this is about the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa after apartheid was dismantled. It’s an extraordinary and very difficult book of real testimony and soul-searching questions for everyone involved. It moved me in a way other books have not. I read it because I’m adapting The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony for the stage. It’s about a conservationist, a herd of wild elephants and is set in South Africa in the late 90s. So the political situation of the time is essential to the story. 4. Television Chernobyl (Sky/HBO) This felt like old-school television – detailed characters, long scenes, less action, more acting. I was struck by the quality of the writing and how it didn’t cower from the very technical aspects of the story. It explained nuclear power to a non-nuclear-literate audience. It felt visceral and stark, with focused and deeply committed performances. It was devastating, top-grade television. 5. Dance Rambert: McGregor/Motin/Shechter I went to see this at Sadler’s Wells because I was about to start working with Rambert on a new project. Each piece was the vision of a different choreographer – Wayne McGregor and Hofesh Shechter’s pieces were being produced after many years and Marion Motin’s piece was a debut. The skill of the dancers and the ideas in each piece were breathtaking. It made me very excited to be working with them. 6. Documentary Quincy (Netflix) This is about Quincy Jones, the legendary music maestro and producer. Made by his daughter Rashida Jones, it follows him, now in his 80s, while looking back at where he began and what he has achieved. He knew Sarah Vaughn and Duke Ellington. He produced Off the Wall, the album that relaunched Michael Jackson. He produced Thriller. I was 14 when the video for Thriller was released in 1983. I stayed up till midnight to watch it. It was all any of us could talk about at school the next day. This was way before the documentary Leaving Neverland. It was when Michael Jackson was groundbreaking on so many levels. And behind it was Quincy Jones. This documentary gave a complete portrait and left me wanting more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2019/jun/25/wg-sebald-suffolk-the-rings-of-saturn","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-25T11:04:12Z","webTitle":"Daydreams and death rays: an odyssey through Sebald's Suffolk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/25/wg-sebald-suffolk-the-rings-of-saturn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/jun/25/wg-sebald-suffolk-the-rings-of-saturn","fields":{"headline":"Daydreams and death rays: an odyssey through Sebald's Suffolk","bodyText":"It started raining when I arrived in Orford. And it was hot. I had the choice of sweating inside my coat or getting soaked. This felt about right – when WG Sebald arrives at this quiet Suffolk port in The Rings of Saturn, the day is “dull and oppressive”. Sebald catches a boat from Orford harbour to Orford Ness. This desolate shingle spit was closed off for military testing during the cold war and only opened up to the public in the early 90s, not long before Sebald took his journey. He tells us stories about “death rays” that were tested there, as well as “a system of pipes” that could unleash a “petroleum inferno” and set the surrounding sea boiling. He describes a place of such “godforsaken loneliness” that people who stayed there too long found themselves “emotionally disturbed”. It sounded fantastic, but there were no boats running. I could only gaze across the brown waters of the River Alde towards the installations in the distance: black pagodas like temples to strange, dark gods, and concrete bunkers humped against the imminent prospect of a nuclear war. It’s easy to see why Sebald talks so often about combustion and destruction. Even if I’d made it across the water, I could never have followed him. He explores a dreamlike landscape, wandering around as if after an apocalypse: “Where and in what time I truly was that day at Orford Ness I cannot say, even now as I write these words.” I walked under grumpy grey skies across Dunwich’s empty heath, which Sebald says “lies forlorn above the sea”. Trudging through that great emptiness I drifted into dark thoughts that echoed his. Sizewell nuclear power station lurked in the distance, “its magnox block a glowering mausoleum”. Sebald gets lost on Dunwich Heath, suffering nightmarish visions of mazes that seem to resemble cross-sections of his brain. Eventually he is “dead tired and ready to lie down anywhere”. He has walked too far. I may have been driving as well as walking, but my day in Suffolk was enough to make clear the physical element of Sebald’s journey. He really put the miles in. Aside from that brief moment of exhaustion on Dunwich Heath, fatigue is barely mentioned. I was intending to follow him on foot across the old railway bridge between Walberswick and Southwold, but when I realised just how far Sebald tramped to get there I had to turn back to the car. Arriving in Southwold, the lighthouse was still as white and bright as Sebald describes. I headed up to Gun Hill, where on 28 May 1672 residents witnessed a sea battle – or they watched “acrid, yellowish smoke creeping across the entire bay” while in its midst thousands of men lost their lives. Looking out over the flat, grey sea, it was hard to imagine it had swallowed so many. Back on the sea front, the Sailor’s Reading Room provided some refuge. Originally intended as a booze-free place for local mariners to while away their hours on land, this maritime retreat remains just as Sebald describes it: “On the walls hang barometers and navigational instruments, figureheads and models of ships in glass cases and in bottles … apart from the muffled sound of the sea and the clicking of balls there is nothing to be heard.” (Actually, there was also the loud ticking of a repeater clock, but let’s not split hairs.) It felt like the only things that have changed since he was there are the newspaper headlines. We’ll never know what Sebald would have made of Boris Johnson’s bid to become prime minister, but those headlines did make me think how difficult it would be to write a book like The Rings of Saturn now. To get lost in the past when the present is so rudely screaming for attention. To be a German living in the UK, but have no need to mention it except in passing, because who would care? To walk through the flatlands of Suffolk and barely mention global warming or the startling inequalities between struggling Lowestoft and chi-chi Southwold. Maybe the fact that it now feels like it’s set in a vanished world is entirely fitting for a book so caught up in destruction and whose very last clause describes a glimpse of a landscape “now being lost for ever”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/23/national-grid-ofgem-hinkley-point-seabank","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T09:28:29Z","webTitle":"National Grid criticises Ofgem over Hinkley Point C proposals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/national-grid-ofgem-hinkley-point-seabank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/national-grid-ofgem-hinkley-point-seabank","fields":{"headline":"National Grid criticises Ofgem over Hinkley Point C proposals","bodyText":"National Grid has hit out at Ofgem’s proposals over an £800m project to connect the Hinkley Point C power station to the electricity network, saying they put investment in the UK energy sector at risk. The Hinkley Seabank plan is an essential overhaul of the power network to send electricity from the new plant in Somerset – which will meet 7% of the UK’s demand – to the rest of the country. The 57km National Grid project involves new substations, underground cables and the new T-pylon design, which are intended to have less impact on the landscape. Shares in the firm fell by 2% on the decision, which National Grid said was “very disappointing”. The company said the regulator’s approach did not reflect the costs of financing and its estimate of £100m savings to consumers was too high. “These parameters do not, in our view, offer the level of returns that would allow sustainable investment in the UK energy sector needed to deliver good outcomes for both customers and investors,” National Grid said in a statement. On Tuesday, Ofgem said it was minded to impose a mechanism on National Grid that simulates the effect of the project being put out to competitive tender. That would be done by setting a lower rate of return than the regulated monopoly would usually face. The model Ofgem has chosen is known as “competition proxy”, and is meant to simulate the cost savings the regulator has managed to achieve in the offshore wind sector, where grid connections are put out to tender. Hinkley Seabank is one of several major power network upgrades that a new generation of nuclear power stations will require. The cost is expected to even higher for other regions – work for new reactors at Moorside in Cumbria has been estimated at £2.8bn. Ofgem’s ruling is known as a “minded to” position; the regulator will make the final decision in the spring. The grid works are due to start 2019 ahead of Hinkley Point C coming online in 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/sep/16/fukushima-fisherman-fear-for-future-over-release-of-radioactive-water","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-16T01:30:19Z","webTitle":"Fukushima fishermen concerned for future over release of radioactive water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/fukushima-fisherman-fear-for-future-over-release-of-radioactive-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/sep/16/fukushima-fisherman-fear-for-future-over-release-of-radioactive-water","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima fishermen concerned for future over release of radioactive water","bodyText":"On the afternoon of 11 March 2011, Tetsu Nozaki watched helplessly as a wall of water crashed into his boats in Onahama, a small fishing port on Japan’s Pacific coast. Nozaki lost three of his seven vessels in one of the worst tsunamis in Japan’s history, part of a triple disaster in which 18,000 people died. But the torment for Nozaki and his fellow fishermen didn’t end there. The resulting triple meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people and sent a plume of radiation into the air and sea. It also came close to crippling the region’s fishing industry. Having spent the past eight years rebuilding, the Fukushima fishing fleet is now confronting yet another menace – the increasing likelihood that the nuclear plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), will dump huge quantities of radioactive water into the ocean. “We strongly oppose any plans to discharge the water into the sea,” Nozaki, head of Fukushima prefecture’s federation of fisheries cooperatives, told the Guardian. Nozaki said local fishermen had “walked through brick walls” to rebuild their industry and confront what they say are harmful rumours about the safety of their seafood. Last year’s catch was just 16% of pre-crisis levels, partly because of the public’s reluctance to eat fish caught off Fukushima. Currently, just over one million tonnes of contaminated water is held in almost 1,000 tanks at Fukushima Daiichi, but the utility has warned that it will run out of space by the summer of 2022. Tepco has struggled to deal with the buildup of groundwater, which becomes contaminated when it mixes with water used to prevent the three damaged reactor cores from melting. Although the utility has drastically reduced the amount of wastewater, about 100 tonnes a day still flows into the reactor buildings. Releasing it into the sea would also anger South Korea, adding to pressure on diplomatic ties already shaken by a trade dispute linked to the countries’ bitter wartime history. Seoul, which has yet to lift an import ban on Fukushima seafood introduced in 2013, claimed last week that discharging the water would pose a “grave threat” to the marine environment – a charge rejected by Japan. Fukushima fisheries officials point out that they operate a stringent testing regime that bans the sale of any seafood found to contain more than 50 becquerels of radioactive material per kilogram – a much lower threshold than the standard of 100 becquerels per kilogram observed in the rest of Japan. At Onahama’s testing centre, just metres from where the catch is unloaded, eight employees conduct tests that last between five and 30 minutes depending on the size of the sample. “Tepco has said that the water can be diluted and safely discharged, but the biggest problem facing us is the spread of harmful rumours,” Hisashi Maeda, a senior Fukushima fisheries official, said as he showed the Guardian around the facility. Confirming Maeda’s fears, almost a third of consumers outside Fukushima prefecture indicated in a survey that dumping the contaminated water into the sea would make them think twice about buying seafood from the region, compared with 20% who currently avoid the produce. Tepco’s Advanced Liquid Processing System removes highly radioactive substances, such as strontium and caesium, from the water but the system is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that coastal nuclear plants commonly dump along with water into the ocean. In addition, Tepco admitted last year that the water in its tanks still contained contaminants beside tritium. Supporters of the discharge option have pointed out that water containing high levels of tritium, which occurs in minute amounts in nature, would not be released until it has been diluted to meet safety standards. But Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany who regularly visits Fukushima, said a proportion of radioactive tritium had the potential to deliver a concentrated dose to cell structures in plants, animals or humans. “Dilution does not avoid this problem,” he said. Burnie believes the solution is to continue storing the water, possibly in areas outside the power plant site – a move that is likely to encounter opposition from nuclear evacuees whose abandoned villages already host millions of cubic metres of radioactive soil. “There is no short-term solution to the water problem at Fukushima Daiichi, as groundwater will continue to enter the site and become contaminated,” Burnie said. “A major step would be for the government to start being honest with the Japanese people and admit that the scale of the challenges at the site mean their entire schedule for decommissioning is a fantasy.” ‘No other option’ Government officials say they won’t make a decision until they have received a report from an expert panel, but there are strong indications that dumping is preferred over other options such a vaporising, burying or storing the water indefinitely. Shinjiro Koizumi, the new environment minister, has not indicated if he shares his predecessor’s belief, voiced last week, that there is “no other option” but to discharge the water into the sea. The International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended that Japan release the treated water, while Toyoshi Fuketa, the chairman of Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority, said a decision on its future must be made soon. “We are entering a period in which further delays in deciding what measure to implement will no longer be tolerable,” Fuketa said, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Putting off a decision could delay work to locate and remove melted fuel from the damaged reactors – a process that is already expected to take four decades. Critics say the government is reluctant to openly support the dumping option for fear of creating a fresh controversy over Fukushima during the Rugby World Cup, which starts this week, and the buildup to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Nozaki said he and other fishermen throughout Fukushima would continue the fight to keep the water out of the ocean. “Releasing the water would send us back to square one,” he said. “It would mean the past eight years have amounted to nothing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/17/government-isnt-quite-ready-drop-obsession-with-nuclear-greg-clark-business-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-17T18:51:00Z","webTitle":"The government isn't quite ready to drop its obsession with nuclear | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/17/government-isnt-quite-ready-drop-obsession-with-nuclear-greg-clark-business-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/17/government-isnt-quite-ready-drop-obsession-with-nuclear-greg-clark-business-secretary","fields":{"headline":"The government is not quite ready to drop its obsession with nuclear","bodyText":"There was excellent news within Hitachi’s decision to shelve its plan to build a £16bn nuclear plant at Wylfa in Anglesey. Finally, a government minister may have grasped the basic problem with nuclear power. It is being “out-competed” by alternative technologies, especially wind and solar, the business secretary, Greg Clark, had to concede in the Commons. Exactly. So drop the obsession with nuclear, last century’s answer to our energy needs. As Clark also said, the package offered to Hitachi was generous. The price of the power, at £75 per megawatt hour, was lower than in EDF’s Hinkley Point C contract, but on this occasion the government would have taken a one-third stake and committed to providing all the debt financing for construction. Adjust for the different financial structure and the package looked very Hinkley-like – in other words, hugely expensive for the poor old bill payer. Hitachi didn’t bite, but, once again, we have discovered the truth about nuclear: it never gets cheaper. When Hinkley was approved in 2016, we were invited to swallow hard and accept the monstrous costs because the Somerset megaplant would trigger a “resurgence” in nuclear and the next stations would be bargains. It was a triumph of hope over experience. In the meantime, wind and solar have continued to tumble in price, as the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), the body charged with injecting some long-term thinking into big national projects, noted last year. Its prescription: “Given the balance of cost and risk, a renewables-based system looks a safer bet at present than constructing multiple new nuclear power plants.” There were a few qualifications to that statement. No country has yet built an electricity system with very high levels of variable renewables, so caution would be required. But the NIC was clear about the correct immediate course: award only one more contract for new nuclear before 2025; don’t commission a whole fleet; back renewables to continue becoming cheaper and see what new advantages can be produced by storage, the technology that could change the calculations again. Clark doesn’t seem ready to go that far. He promised to set out a new approach to funding nuclear projects in the summer. We’ll await the details, but most of the supposedly “clever” financing solutions, such as the “regulated asset base” model, sound like ways to shovel construction risks on to consumers and disguise the fact within their bills. They don’t change the fundamental expense of nuclear. A better approach is possible. Ministers should read their own infrastructure adviser’s report. A pall hangs over shopping malls Analysts at Jefferies produced a handy illustration the other week to what they called “shop-ageddon”. It showed the total return performance (that’s share price plus dividend) of the quoted property stocks in 2018. Here’s a few lowlights. Intu, minus 51.8%; Capital &amp; Regional, minus 49%; and Hammerson, minus 36.3%. You get the drift. But here’s something that tells the tale of the collapse in retail property prices even more dramatically. The Postings centre in Kirkcaldy, boasting 21 stores and a 299-space car park, has been put up for sale by its pension fund owner with a reserve price of just £1. That’s an extreme example of what’s going on, and the Postings is being marketed as an opportunity to redevelop the site, which makes it unusual. All the same, it is very hard to see what is going to improve confidence in this sector in 2019. There are too many shops in the land and the rise of online shopping is relentless. As the landlords are discovering, their negotiating power is collapsing. High-profile store closure programmes – from the likes of House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams – all turn the screw a little more. Whistling cheerfully, the owners of mega-malls say their premises will still prosper because they have “destination” appeal. Well, maybe, but the stock market tends to be a decent judge. It doesn’t see many pockets of safety. No rush to offload RBS shares Royal Bank of Scotland – finally – has surplus capital and has announced a plan to buy a portion of the state’s 62.3% shareholding. It’s a reasonable idea. The Treasury clearly wants to reduce its stake and, while it can just sell more shares in the market, this is another way to the same destination. But it’s an odd time to announce the plan. Brexit has battered the share prices of all big UK banks and the Treasury is always vulnerable to the charge that it is selling its RBS shares too cheaply. Best to wait awhile before pressing go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2019/sep/15/ex-google-worker-fears-killer-robots-cause-mass-atrocities","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-15T14:35:43Z","webTitle":"Ex-Google worker fears 'killer robots' could cause mass atrocities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/15/ex-google-worker-fears-killer-robots-cause-mass-atrocities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2019/sep/15/ex-google-worker-fears-killer-robots-cause-mass-atrocities","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Google worker fears 'killer robots' could cause mass atrocities","bodyText":"A new generation of autonomous weapons or “killer robots” could accidentally start a war or cause mass atrocities, a former top Google software engineer has warned. Laura Nolan, who resigned from Google last year in protest at being sent to work on a project to dramatically enhance US military drone technology, has called for all AI killing machines not operated by humans to be banned. Nolan said killer robots not guided by human remote control should be outlawed by the same type of international treaty that bans chemical weapons. Unlike drones, which are controlled by military teams often thousands of miles away from where the flying weapon is being deployed, Nolan said killer robots have the potential to do “calamitous things that they were not originally programmed for”. There is no suggestion that Google is involved in the development of autonomous weapons systems. Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice. Nolan, who has joined the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: “The likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once. What you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare, especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed. “There could be large-scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways. Which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control, otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous.” Google recruited Nolan, a computer science graduate from Trinity College Dublin, to work on Project Maven in 2017 after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years, becoming one of its top software engineers in Ireland. She said she became “increasingly ethically concerned” over her role in the Maven programme, which was devised to help the US Department of Defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology. Instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets, Nolan and others were asked to build a system where AI machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate. Google allowed the Project Maven contract to lapse in March this year after more than 3,000 of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company’s involvement. “As a site reliability engineer my expertise at Google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running, and this is what I was supposed to help Maven with. Although I was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition I realised that I was still part of the kill chain; that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the US military in places like Afghanistan.” Although she resigned over Project Maven, Nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote-controlled drones. She outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course, with possibly fatal consequences. “You could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching; there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food. The machine doesn’t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has. “The other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone. Maybe that’s happening with the Russians at present in Syria, who knows? What we do know is that at the UN Russia has opposed any treaty let alone ban on these weapons by the way. “If you are testing a machine that is making its own decisions about the world around it then it has to be in real time. Besides, how do you train a system that runs solely on software how to detect subtle human behaviour or discern the difference between hunters and insurgents? How does the killing machine out there on its own flying about distinguish between the 18-year-old combatant and the 18-year-old who is hunting for rabbits?” The ability to convert military drones, for instance into autonomous non-human guided weapons, “is just a software problem these days and one that can be relatively easily solved”, said Nolan. She said she wanted the Irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons. “I am not saying that missile-guided systems or anti-missile defence systems should be banned. They are after all under full human control and someone is ultimately accountable. These autonomous weapons however are an ethical as well as a technological step change in warfare. Very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons, these killer robots, could accidentally start a flash war, destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities.” Autonomous threat? Some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include: The US navy’s AN-2 Anaconda gunboat, which is being developed as a “completely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities” and can “loiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention”. Russia’s T-14 Armata tank, which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous. It is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside. The US Pentagon has hailed the Sea Hunter autonomous warship as a major advance in robotic warfare. An unarmed 40 metre-long prototype has been launched that can cruise the ocean’s surface without any crew for two to three months at a time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/nov/08/toshibas-failure-shows-business-cant-deliver-a-nuclear-future","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-09T00:01:20Z","webTitle":"Toshiba's failure shows private sector cannot deliver nuclear future for UK | Phillip Inman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/08/toshibas-failure-shows-business-cant-deliver-a-nuclear-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/nov/08/toshibas-failure-shows-business-cant-deliver-a-nuclear-future","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba's failure shows business can't deliver a nuclear future","bodyText":"If the government was keen to boost Britain’s nuclear industry, it was always clear that the private market would struggle to deliver. The decision by Toshiba to close down its UK operations is a case in point. After the deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point with the French firm EDF, Toshiba was favoured by ministers to design and construct a smaller power station on the Cumbrian coast. Hinkley was a deal that appeared to be with a private company but the really meaningful talks were between Whitehall officials and their counterparts in the French government, EDF’s controlling shareholder. It took years of agonising brinkmanship to conclude the talks, much of them conducted on the French side by the then economy minister, Emmanuel Macron. Toshiba, on the other hand, is a private company struggling on its own to navigate the complex politics surrounding nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. In 2006 it bought the US nuclear business Westinghouse, part of British Nuclear Fuels and home to much of the UK’s nuclear power industry. With climate change creeping to the top of the agenda and demand for new nuclear plants around the world growing, it seemed like a good idea. However, the 2011 Fukushima disaster changed all that. Governments in Japan and other countries halted the development of new nuclear plants. Last year, cost overruns on building the first new US nuclear power plants in three decades pushed Westinghouse into bankruptcy and Toshiba into financial meltdown. The future of the Cumbrian nuclear plant has been in doubt ever since. Earlier this year Toshiba sold Westinghouse to a private equity outfit as a services provider for existing nuclear plants. The construction of new reactors was not on the agenda. To no one’s surprise, Toshiba has now confirmed it has abandoned building any new plants in the UK. Without entering the argument about whether nuclear is a good option – and the government advisory body, the National Infrastructure Commission, is unequivocal that renewables such as wind and solar were going to be a safer, cheaper option – it is clear huge commitments of time, resources and political capital are necessary for infrastructure projects of this scale to get off the ground and through to completion. Amazon delivers further misery to UK high streets On Thursday, Amazon unveiled the architectural plans for a new “fulfilment centre” covering the north-east. Such is the banality of its design, it will fail to dazzle and amaze anyone who passes it on the A66 outside Darlington. Nobody will be distracted by its grey exterior and shed-like construction. The Angel of the North will look down and cry. And yet this architectural crime will be nothing compared to the damage it is likely to cause to high streets across the north-east, and none more so than Darlington’s, which has already lost many of its bigger shops. Analysts at PwC say the north-east has seen a net loss of 72 shops in the first half of 2018. These are the outlets of multiple retailers and the report therefore leaves outside its ambit the many independent shops that have gone to the wall. The north-east was not even the worst. The West Midlands lost 89 of its larger shops. Among the latest to announce closures are Evans Cycles, Debenhams, House of Fraser and New Look. Marks &amp; Spencer is shrinking its high street footprint, as are many others. The trend is unstoppable and affecting everywhere. London is not immune, despite the welter of tourists charging through the West End and beyond. London saw 448 large shops open and 716 close, giving a net loss of 268. Former chancellor George Osborne knew the high street was dying back in 2015. A smart cookie, he hatched a plan to put councils in charge of business rates, the tax that all bricks-and-mortar businesses pay based on the rentable value of their property. Just a quick look at the Amazon shed shows that its rentable value will be a fraction of the shops it replaces. And in the town centres, the trajectory for rateable values is only going down. Osborne’s scheme is inspired by the US, where mayors and local governments bargain away tax revenues in return for factories, distribution sheds and the like being located in their areas. Jobs, any jobs, are their priority. Which raises the questions, are the 3,500 Amazon jobs on the outskirts of Darlington the equivalent of shop worker positions in the town? Not when towns are hollowed out, tax revenues plummet and the quality of local jobs slumps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/jan/27/german-consumer-confidence-falls-as-markets-await-fed-decision-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-27T15:16:21Z","webTitle":"IMF warns of share price bubble as stocks slide before Fed decision - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jan/27/german-consumer-confidence-falls-as-markets-await-fed-decision-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/jan/27/german-consumer-confidence-falls-as-markets-await-fed-decision-business-live","fields":{"headline":"IMF warns of share price bubble as stocks slide before Fed decision - as it happened","bodyText":"The sell-off in global stocks has gathered pace as worries over extended Covid-19 restrictions and the vaccine rollout resurfaced. Oil prices are falling, reversing earlier gains. UK’s FTSE down 107 points, or 1.6%, at 6,546 German’s Dax down 2.49% at 13,525 France’s CAC down 2.03% at 5,411 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 1.9% at 21,565 Nasdaq down 2.09% at 13,341 S&amp;P 500 down 2% at 3,769 Markets are waiting for the US Federal Reserve decision at the end of its policy meeting at 7pm GMT tonight, followed by a press conference. We are not expecting any change to the Fed’s ultra-loose stance. Tech giants Apple and Facebook and the electric carmaker Tesla are due to announce their fourth-quarter results after Wall Street closes. Microsoft revealed stellar results last night after the shift to working from home led to a surge in demand for its PCs, Xboxes and cloud services. Governments and central banks must maintain their pandemic rescue programmes or risk triggering a stock market crash, the International Monetary Fund has said. A row over coronavirus vaccine shortages in the EU has descended into farce as AstraZeneca denied claims by the European commission that it had pulled out of a crunch meeting over a breakdown in supplies. And here’s an explainer of the vaccines row. Boeing’s 737 Max has been cleared to fly again by the European regulator after being grounded for 22 months following two fatal crashes. Goldman Sachs has cut the pay of its chief executive, David Solomon, by $10m (£7.3m) after the bank was forced to pay billions of dollars to settle an international investigation into its role in the 1MDB scandal. The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow -- stay safe! - JK On Wall Street, stocks are falling, mirroring declines in Europe. The Nasdaq has lost 2%, and the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have fallen 1%. The FTSE 100 in London has also declined 2%. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, says: The weaker 0.2% gain in headline durable goods orders in December was mainly due to ongoing problems among aircraft manufacturers and a drop off in defence orders. The bigger story is the continued strong gains in core orders, which underlines that the recovery in business equipment investment still has plenty of momentum. With restrictions on international travel tightening in recent weeks, demand for aircraft will remain at very low levels for the foreseeable future. Despite that persistent drag, the continued strength of core orders means that overall durable goods orders and shipments are now back above pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the boost from lower interest rates and the relative resilience of the investment-intensive manufacturing sector. The latest business surveys suggest that durable goods orders will continue to rise at a rapid pace over the coming months. In the US, business orders for durable goods such as tools, appliances and new cars rose in December for the eighth month in a row, but by just 0.2%, far less than the 1% forecast by analysts. This was due to a a slump in demand for new airplanes (mainly at Boeing) since the start of the pandemic, which caused a 1% drop in transport orders. Stripping out transportation, core orders rose by 0.7% – an increase described as “solid” by economists. The sell-off continues on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 index is down 112 points, or 0.69%, at 6,541 Germany’s Dax down 2.23% at 13,561 France’s CAC down 1.85% at 5,418 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 1.87% at 21,575 Oil prices have also slipped into the red, with Brent crude down 18 cents at $55.76 a barrel, and US crude falling 11 cents to $52.5 a barrel. You can read the full global financial stability report here. Governments and central banks must maintain their pandemic rescue programmes or risk triggering a stock market crash, the International Monetary Fund has said. Warning that there were legitimate concerns about a share price bubble, the Washington-based organisation said that without continued low interest rates and government subsidies it was possible a “correction’ in stock markets across the world would be the unwelcome result, writes our economics correspondent Phillip Inman. In a report issued to coincide with the World Economic Forum – held virtually this year because of the pandemic – the IMF said investors had ignored recent data showing major economies slowing as the pandemic persisted through the winter months. There was also the prospect that vaccination programmes would take longer to roll out, especially across the developing world, forcing governments to maintain restrictions for a longer period. Financial markets have rebounded since last March and some have soared to fresh highs. Both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 in the US hit all-time peaks this week. Josh Mahoney, senior market analyst at the online trading platform IG, reckons the Dow Jones will open 89 points lower, at 30,848. And what can we expect from the Fed tonight? The Federal Reserve come back into focus today, with traders increasingly looking towards the US for some form of stimulus boost in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, with Biden expected to drive forth his $1.9 trillion stimulus coronavirus support package, we are unlikely to see the Fed turn up the dials at today’s meeting. A new year brings new voting members for the Fed, with four regional Fed members rotating into a position where their opinion can be better reflected. Key to that voting member rotation is the addition of Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic who has already speculated that the Fed might be able to ‘recalibrate’ in ‘fairly short order’ once the recovery gets going. Despite fears that Bostic could be keen to start the tapering discussion, Powell has been swift to disregard the notion that we will see any form of monetary tightening in the near-future. Nevertheless, markets will keeping a close eye on commentary around this meeting as the promise of a vaccine and fiscal stimulus-led recovery ensures the committee could soon start discussing how their position should change. The sell-off on European stock markets has gathered pace, ahead of the US Federal Reserve policy decision. In London, mining shares are leading the losers, amid concerns that extended coronavirus lockdowns will hit demand for commodities. UK’s FTSE 100 down 0.98%, or 65 points, 6,588 Germany’s Dax down 1.57% at 13,653 France’s CAC down 0.95% at 5,471 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 1.51% at 21,660 Wall Street has been a lot more buoyant than Europe recently, with tech giants such as Microsoft spreading excitement. We’ll be getting quarterly results from Facebook, Tesla and Apple after market close tonight. The discount retailer Poundland and its sister chain Dealz are planning to open nearly 100 more stores across Europe as the group shrugs off the difficulties on the high street, writes our retail correspondent Sarah Butler. The group is planning to open 27 stores in the UK and Ireland and 70 in Span and Poland after reporting an 8.4% rise in revenues in the three months to the end of December. Sales at stores able to trade during the high street lockdowns rose by 4.3% as shoppers picked up homewares and cheap groceries. Andy Bond, the chief executive of Poundland and Dealz’ parent company Pepco Group which is considering a potential IPO, said the company would not be paying back business rates relief in the UK, despite enjoying strong trading while other stores were forced to close. He said that Poundland had closed more than 100 of its UK and Irish stores at the height of the lockdown and incurred additional costs to protect staff and customers. What the government tried to do with business rates relief was to ensure good businesses survive and could grow again. We are doing our part of the bargain. We have managed our business well through this and are investing in the future. He said Poundland and Dealz were stepping up growth in the UK and Europe because they were “increasingly confident” about the stores’ popularity with shoppers. He added: Previous economic downturns have provided discount retailers with increased opportunities and confident and brave as we are it is time to put our foot down on the accelerator. Back in the US, GameStop has become one the hottest stocks of the year. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the video games chain hard. Like many retailers, already suffering from the shift to online sales, GameStop is losing money and plans to close 450 stores this year, reports Edward Helmore in New York. And yet, surprisingly, its share price has soared from $3.25 last April, when the company announced mass closures. Yesterday the share price nearly doubled to $147.98 (up 93%), pumped up again by small investors hoping to ruin Wall Street bets that the price would crash. The company’s stock market valuation jumped to $10.3bn. A tweet from Tesla boss Elon Musk fired up the share price rally. The shares rocketed a further 125% to $333.50 in pre-market trading today and are on track for a fifth session of gains. “Gamestonk!!” Musk wrote on Twitter yesterday, merging GameStop’s name and “stocks”, slang for stocks, and linked to Reddit’s Wallstreetbets stock-trading discussion group, where small investors have been promoting GameStop aggressively. The 37-year-old chain store group is now the focus of a David-and-Goliath battle between an army of small investors and Wall Street that shows no signs of abating and has highlighted some fundamental shifts in investing. Here’s our full story on the delays to Hinkley Point. The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer. And here’s the story about the surge in sofa sales at ScC. Over in the US, Amazon is attempting to force workers planning to unionise at an Alabama warehouse to vote in person rather than by mail as it fights off a landmark attempt by its staff to organise, reports Michael Sainato, who writes on civil rights issues for the Miami Times. Also in America, Goldman Sachs has cut the pay of chief executive David Solomon by slicing $10m (£7.3m) off his annual bonus, after the bank was forced to pay billions of dollars to settle an international investigation into its role in the 1MDB scandal, reports our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff. The part-time DJ was still granted a $15.5m bonus on top of his $2m annual salary, in light of the investment bank’s bumper performance last year. It left Solomon – who earned $27.5m in 2019 – with a pay packet totalling $17.5m, making him one of the worst-paid banking bosses on Wall Street in 2020. Solomon’s pay is nearly half the size of the $31.5m package handed to JP Morgan’s chief Jamie Dimon. Morgan Staley’s boss James Gorman surpassed both rivals after receiving $33m. On the markets, the FTSE 100 in London briefly ventured into positive territory, but is now trading lower again, by some 20 points, a 0.32% drop, to 6,632. Germany’s Dax has lost 0.33%, France’s CAC is flat and Italy’s FTSE MiB has shed 0.66%. Oil prices are still pushing higher after US crude stockpiles unexpectedly dropped last week, and as China, the world’s biggest oil importer, reported the smallest daily rise in new Covid-19 cases in more than two weeks. Brent crude is 55 cents ahead at $56.22 a barrel while US crude has gained 49 cents to $52.87. German consumer confidence heading into February has declined for a fourth month and to the lowest level since June, according to the research institute GfK. The main event today is the US Federal Reserve policy decision at 7pm GMT. We are not expecting any change –– the Fed is widely expected to maintain its ultra-loose policy stance with interest rates near zero, and $120bn of bond purchases each month and other liquidity boosting measures. US tech giants Facebook and Apple and the electric carmaker Tesla will release fourth-quarter results after US markets close. Microsoft revealed last night that it had a blockbuster quarter, as working from home boosted demand for its PCs, cloud services and Xboxes. Sales surged 17% and profits jumped 33% to $15.5bn. In the UK-EU vaccine wars, AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot has done a long interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. He explained the “glitches” during vaccine production in Belgium which have led to lower supply in the EU, and dismissed suggestions that the UK is being unfairly prioritised for Covid-19 vaccine doses. It has emerged that Sir Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia collapsed under the weight of a debt pile of £750m. This is according to reports drawn up by Deloitte, which was appointed as Arcadia’s administrator at the end of November, the Daily Telegraph reported. Topshop and Topman had gross liabilities of more than £550m. EDF Energy has said that the Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs to £23bn, reports our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The fresh delays are expected to add £500m to the cost of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation, and delay its first electricity generation to the summer of 2026. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak Hinkley Point was expected to start up by the end of 2025, at a cost of between £21.5bn to £22.5bn. But EDF Energy warned that the pandemic had caused delays of three months last year, and was expected to lead to similar delays in 2021 too. “Ten months after it began, we are still facing the full force of the pandemic,” Stuart Crooks, the managing director of Hinkley Point C, said in a video message to employees. In the UK-EU vaccine wars, it is worth reading this long interview by AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot with Italian newspaper La Repubblica. He explains in detail why the amount of vaccine produced by different sites may vary hugely, and that the UK ordered the Covid-19 vaccine (100m doses) from the drugmaker three months before the EU –- as we have also reported. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it’s essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - something like this that’s never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed. Soriot has rejected calls to divert doses to the European Union following a breakdown in supply there, saying the UK will come first, in line with AstraZeneca’s contractual obligations. The UK agreement was reached in June, three months before the European one. As you could imagine, the UK government said the supply coming out of the UK supply chain would go for the UK first. Basically, that’s how it is. The European commission did not deny claims on Tuesday that during heated talks EU officials had asked the Anglo-Swedish company to redirect doses made in the UK to make up for problems at a Belgian plant. In a speech to the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, made clear her anger at AstraZeneca’s approach, warning the EU “means business”. The EU and others helped with money to build research capacities and production facilities. Europe invested billions to help develop the world’s first Covid-19 vaccines. To create a truly global common good. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations.” The commission is to release details of a new export register by the end of the week to oblige vaccine suppliers to notify it of exports – with the German government raising the spectre of a block on the movement of doses outside the EU. Turning to the UK housing market... the latest Covid-19 surge has shaken the housing market, reducing the flow of new homes being listed for sale by 12% in the first few weeks of 2021, according to the latest data from the property website Zoopla. The shortage of properties on the market is pushing up prices, with house price growth reaching near four year high at 4.3%. Richard Donnell, research &amp; insight director at Zoopla, says: The housing market momentum built up in the second half of 2020 has rolled into early 2021, despite a spike in the pandemic and a third lockdown. Sellers are more cautious however and appear to be waiting for case numbers to drop much further before listing their home, or until we see a return to tier based restrictions. “The strength of the market in 2020 has eroded the available number of homes for sale and this will mean continued upward pressure on house prices in the short term. The most affordable parts of the UK are recording the highest rate of price growth for 10 years up to 5.4% a year. We still expect house price growth to slow towards 1% by the end of the year. Private rents in some of the UK’s biggest city centres have fallen by up to 12% in a year but have risen sharply in parts of northern England as some tenants swapped an urban life for the suburbs, smaller towns and villages, writes Rupert Jones. Here’s a quick round-up of the main news overnight. The rating agency S&amp;P has warned 13 oil and gas companies, including the some of the world’s biggest, that it may downgrade them within weeks because of increasing competition from renewable energy, writes my colleague Ben Butler in Australia. On notice of a possible downgrade are Australia’s Woodside Petroleum as well as multinationals Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Imperial Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, Shell Energy North America, Canadian Natural Resources, ConocoPhillips and French group Total. Gordon Brown has called for emergency measures to support businesses in the budget after new research from the London School of Economics warned almost 1m UK companies were at risk of failure in the next three months, writes our economics editor, Larry Elliott. A sharp fall in cash machine usage last year has prompted a warning that more ATMs could end up being closed or imposing fees, writes Rupert Jones on our Money desk. Analysts at Shore Capital, Darren Shirley and Clive Black, have looked at the sofa retailer ScC’s results. At the start of the important winter trading period on Boxing Day, ScS was trading from 57 out of its total 100 stores, with a further 37 forced to closed on the 30th December; with all closed on the 4th January. The stores are reported to have traded strongly whilst open. Online continues to partially compensate for store closures, increasing by 98% in the period, though most customers appear to want the tactile experience of a store visit ahead of purchasing furniture, and particularly floorings! Despite this end of period decline, the news on the ScS’ order book is broadly encouraging, sitting at £90.5m on the 26th January (inc. VAT), which is £16.8m higher year-on-year. Conversely, oil prices have climbed after industry data showed US crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week. And China, the world’s second-biggest oil user, has recorded its lowest daily rise in Covid-19 infections (75 new cases) in over a fortnight, sparking hopes that demand for oil will rise. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has risen 30 cents to $56.25 a barrel, a 0.54% gain, while US crude gained 26 cents to $52.87 a barrel, up 0.49%. Oil prices hit 11-month highs at the start of the year but the rally appears to have run out of steam. Economists at ING said: Market participants are now in ‘wait and see’ mode, wanting to see how lockdowns evolve in the coming weeks and months, and how successful countries are in rolling out Covid-19 vaccines. And we’re off. Following a better day yesterday, European shares are sliding again. UK’s FTSE 100 down 38 points, or 0.6%, at 6,614 Germany’s Dax down 0.3% France’s CAC down 0.2% Spain’s Ibex down 0.3% Italy’s FTSE MiB down 0.45% There isn’t much corporate news here in London this morning, apart from ScS, the sofa retailer, reporting surging sales of sofas. My colleague Jo Partridge reports: Sofa retailer ScS enjoyed surging sales over the last six months, as locked-down consumers opted to spend money on new furniture for their homes. Gross sales at ScS rose by 13.9% over the 26 weeks to 23 January to reach £182.3m, compared with sales of £160m a year earlier. However the company, one of the UK’s largest retailers of upholstered furniture and flooring, said it had seen a slump in new orders over the last month, as coronavirus restrictions once again forced its stores to close during its winter sale. The retailer welcomed a significant increase in new orders in June and July 2020 following the first lockdown, as the majority of its customers chose to wait until stores reopened to try out the firm’s fabric and leather sofas in person before making the decision about which one to buy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Microsoft released stellar results last night as the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a boom in PC sales and video gaming and drove higher usage of the company’s cloud services. The Xbox and PC maker posted a 17% increase in revenues to $43.1bn between October and December, which beat forecasts. Profits jumped 33% to $15.5bn, sending Microsoft shares to a record high. Today, Facebook, Tesla and Apple are due to release earnings after Wall Street closes. Apart from the tech results, the main event is the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision at the end of its two-day meeting – the first in 2021. It is expected to leave policy unchanged and stick to its ultra-loose stance: i.e. near zero interest rates and $120bn of bond purchases every month and other liquidity relief measures to help the Covid-ravaged American economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: And there will certainly be no hint of a policy tightening, or tapering in the foreseeable future, given that the health crisis has not been losing speed with the mutation of the virus and delay in vaccine distributions across the globe. It appears that Joe Biden has been too optimistic about getting anyone who wants vaccinated by the end of spring. It is now said that end-of-summer is a more realistic target, if all goes well with the production and the distribution of doses. Speaking of that, the unconsidered scarcity in vaccine doses may turn the trade tensions between the US and Europe that emerged under Trump administration into a vaccine war, as Germany now threatens to retaliate over the US trade restrictions by limiting AstraZeneca’s vaccine exports. No one saw that coming. As such, the latest developments around the vaccine are bad enough to keep the Fed doves in charge. Consumer confidence in Germany has fallen for a fourth month heading into February, not surprising given that the country is in another coronavirus lockdown. Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed last week to extend the lockdown until mid-February. The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a poll of 2,000 Germans, fell to -15.6 points from a revised -7.5 in January. It is the lowest reading since June. GfK researcher Rolf Bürkl said confidence was likely to remain muted into March. Asian markets are mostly higher after a choppy session, with Japan’s Nikkei closing 0.31% higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.1% and the Australian stock market fell 0.72%. We are expecting a mixed open for European markets. The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting – digital Davos – continues today. This afternoon there are a series of sessions devoted to discussing net zero and climate change, including one with the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, now a UN special envoy for climate and finance, and Al Gore, the former US vice president and environmentalist. Carney has also joined the Canadian fund manager Brookfield Asset Management to spearhead environmental and social investing.

One suspects not. The UK has a strong candidate to push to be managing director of the IMF. He is Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Osborne’s claim seems to rest on the idea that the current editor of the Evening Standard is a skilful political animal who could attract votes from around the world, and thus find a way through the IMF board’s opaque selection process. Well, OK, he’s European and a European always gets the gig according to the cosy convention that allows the US a free run at the top post at the World Bank. Osborne also ticks the box that says it’s finally time for a Briton at the IMF. As for the Brexit factor, it’s an obstacle to gaining the necessary support of the EU. The fan club, however, will say it is surmountable: the UK will still be a large economy and cannot be excluded permanently from the top table. And Osborne may think he can raise a cheer in Beijing since, in office, he was fond of giving speeches about “a golden decade” in UK-China trade relations, even to the point of funding our nuclear power stations with cash from the Chinese Communist party. Come on, though, Osborne at the IMF sounds a stretch too far. The main problem isn’t the fact the IMF’s economists regularly objected to the austerity policies he pursued as chancellor. Among the chummy Davos brigade, ideological clashes can usually be quietly forgotten. Rather, the main issue is simple: Carney is just a bigger figure on the global stage. The governor has headed two central banks – the other being the Bank of Canada – and was chairman of the Financial Stability Board, the body that has done serious work behind the scenes in clearing up the mess of the 2008-09 crash. On the climate crisis, an area where the IMF is more vocal, you’ll find more serious thinking in Carney’s recent speeches than in any of Osborne’s budgets. The governor’s CV will be more attractive to other EU nations, without whose support no London-backed candidate will get far. Carney can also wave Canadian, Irish and British passports, which covers several bases. We don’t know if he is interested in the job but, if he is, he could easily win the contest. Osborne looks an extremely long shot. What’s got into the water at Ofwat? The regulator has recently told four water companies – including Thames, Anglian and Yorkshire – to sit in detention until they can do their homework properly. The company’s first submissions of its business plans for 2020-25 period were deemed inadequate, and now the re-jigged versions have also failed. The firms have been given a fortnight to do better. Has Labour’s nationalisation agenda provoked a tougher approach on the part of a regulator that has rightly been accused of timidity in the past? Actually, no, it would be wrong to read too much into this tale. The simple explanation is probably correct: the four laggards are just less efficient than their rivals and deserve a good kick. Remember that the three stock market companies – Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water, which is owned by Pennon – all scored top marks for their business plans at the first attempt. Ofwat says the others have “not yet risen to the challenge”. This is roughly the way the regulatory system is supposed to work: in the interest of keeping bills down, inefficient firms have to catch up with the leaders. The losers in the process would probably love to blame their woes on the idea the regulator has become politicised. They should look in the mirror. William Hill employees are dealt a bad hand The bookmakers says it could close 700 high-street shops, putting 4,500 jobs under threat. Across the industry, a quarter of premises could close. William Hill will blame the cut in maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 per spin to £2 and, on a short-term perspective, it would be right. The machines used to generate half the income in the shops. On a long-term view, though, this day was always coming. The machines had been clearly become a social blight and the bookies, even when evidence of harm piled up, did too little to reform themselves. Change is terrible for low-paid employees, but it had to happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/jun/06/boris-johnson-confidence-vote-graham-brady-tory-mps-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T22:56:26Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson no-confidence vote: prime minister wins by 211 to 148 but 40% of Tory MPs fail to back him – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jun/06/boris-johnson-confidence-vote-graham-brady-tory-mps-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/jun/06/boris-johnson-confidence-vote-graham-brady-tory-mps-live","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson no-confidence vote: prime minister wins by 211 to 148 but 40% of Tory MPs fail to back him – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from this evening: Boris Johnson was clinging to his premiership on Monday night after 148 of his MPs voted to oust him from Downing Street in a ballot that exposed potentially fatal rifts within his party. The prime minister won the support of 211 MPs but 41% of his party voted to get rid of him. It was the worst verdict on a sitting prime minister by their own party in recent times. In a clip for broadcasters Boris Johnson has described the result as “good news” because, he claimed, it would allow the government to put Partygate behind it and to focus on “what we as a government are doing to help people”. He insisted it was an “extremely good” result despite a worse performance than Theresa May in her confidence vote. Keir Starmer said it was “grotesque” that Tory MPs voted to support someone with no sense of duty. He said: “The Conservative party now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law. The Conservative party now believes that the British public have no right to expect honest politicians.” Starting an instant spin operation outside the room where the result was announced, the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly called it “a comfortable win” and said rebels should now give up on their efforts. Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, told Sky News that Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, would be “punching the air” tonight because his ally, Boris Johnson, will remain as PM. Tory rebels have vowed to keep trying to force Boris Johnson from office, as the prime minister’s allies admitted he was reaching “the beginning of the end” after a devastating result in Monday night’s confidence vote. They will hold his feet to the fire as the next Partygate inquiry – into whether the prime minister misled parliament by denying any Covid rules were broken in Downing Street – gets under way in the coming weeks. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written about how the day of infighting played out. We are closing this liveblog shortly. Thanks so much for joining us. Our liveblog on the Russia-Ukraine war is still live and you can follow it here: Boris Johnson’s allies had always said about the vote of no confidence that victory by just one vote was still a win, and he would remain in Downing Street and get on with delivering “the people’s priorities”. They will no doubt be cracking opening the bubbly on Monday evening. But the truth is that with 148 votes against him, the task of governing is likely to become more, not less difficult in the weeks and months ahead. As rebel MPs determined to oust him are likely to point out at the earliest opportunity, those 148 rebels dramatically outnumber Johnson’s working majority of 75. While they are not a coherent group of zealots, of the kind that ultimately saw off Theresa May over Brexit policy, his detractors do share a set of concerns they may now feel emboldened to pursue more vocally – including by withholding their support in the voting lobbies. Some are irked by the fact the government is on a trajectory towards the highest tax burden since Clement Attlee was in power. Others have spoken out in recent months about the illiberal nature of Johnson’s government, which has become more marked in recent months as he tried to appease the right wing of his party after his position appeared under threat in January. The former minister Jesse Norman – biographer of the Conservative intellectual hero Edmund Burke – pointed in his blistering letter on Monday to the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, and the ban on noisy protests. Yet more MPs are frustrated at the sense of drift and indecision in the face of a mounting economic crisis – or simply fear for their seats, with a party leader the public appear to be firmly convinced is a proven liar. Johnson did little to win over the latter group at Monday’s 1922 Committee meeting, where he appeared unrepentant about Partygate, even telling MPs he would attend boozy lockdown leaving bashes again. Afterwards, one ally delivered an extraordinarily tone deaf briefing to waiting journalists, asking them: “Is there anyone here who hasn’t got pissed in their lives? Is there anyone here who doesn’t like a glass of wine to decompress?” It is just possible that the bullish Johnson is not feeling as bloody-minded as the briefing suggests, and after the humiliation of being booed outside St Paul’s on Friday, his fragile ego could finally get the better of him and prompt him to resign. But most colleagues believe he is likely to remain in Downing Street, hoping to bulldoze his way through to the next general election. Read the full story here: Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said Conservative MPs must unite behind Boris Johnson and focus on “making people’s lives better”, after the prime minister survived a vote of confidence. On why Johnson should remain in Number 10, Lewis told the PA news agency: Quite simply, look, I’m a democrat, we have had a democratic vote, we had one in 2016, we have to finish delivering the work in Northern Ireland from my job, which comes from Brexit, which we voted for. (In) 2019, the general public overwhelmingly gave Boris Johnson and our party the support, beyond anything we have seen since the height of Margaret Thatcher. He has won the vote tonight, we have got to come back together now, focus on the job and be focused on making the people’s lives better tomorrow and in the future. That’s what his focus is, that’s where all our focus should be. Tory rebels have vowed to keep trying to force Boris Johnson from office, as the prime minister’s allies admitted he was reaching “the beginning of the end” after a devastating result in Monday night’s confidence vote. Johnson’s struggle to hold his divided party together will become more intense, with some of the 148 MPs, or 40%, who voted against him said to be “implacably opposed” to his premiership. They will hold his feet to the fire as the next Partygate inquiry – into whether the prime minister misled parliament by denying any Covid rules were broken in Downing Street – gets under way in the coming weeks. Several rebel MPs boasted the government whipping operation had been “appalling” and appeared to collapse under the weight of Monday night’s rebellion, meaning Johnson was now on “borrowed time”. The divide between those backing and opposing Johnson threatens to derail Downing Street’s attempts to draw a line under the humiliating episode. Though the majority of Tory MPs supported the prime minister, a significant number voted to oust him in the secret ballot held by the 1922 Committee. The result had echoes of another confidence ballot in 2018, when Theresa May won the support of two-thirds of her party but was left irrevocably damaged. Government sources insisted the margin of Johnson’s victory did not matter, with one cabinet minister saying “a win is a win”. They said that given the result, the rebels needed to either “change the rules or shut the fuck up”. Other allies of Johnson said drastic action was needed to restore discipline, such as sacking anyone on the government payroll who remained conspicuously silent on Monday while colleagues tweeted their support. Though MPs were forbidden from taking pictures of their ballot paper to prove they had voted to support the prime minister, many were told to make public statements. Read more here: The front pages of the papers have been released. Unsurprisingly, Boris Johnson and the results of the confidence vote dominate the UK papers. Here’s our splash: Here are the others. The Telegraph calls the result a “hollow victory” that “tears Tories apart”. The Daily Star, in a very colourful front page, have called Johnson Pinocchio. The Daily Mirror, who helped break the news about Partygate, says simply: “Party’s over, Boris.” The Metro went for the same messaging. Meanwhile The Sun have dubbed the evening the “Night of the blond knives”. Using a close up of Johnson looking deeply unhappy, the Times describes him as “A wounded victor”. The i Paper also says he is wounded and that he is “in peril”. The Daily Mail is the most supportive of the papers and says the 148 rebels have hit the “self destruct button” while the headlines reads: “Boris vows: I’ll bash on.” It is “always disappointing” when there is a “significant minority of your own party voting in such a way”, the environment secretary, George Eustice, has said. Speaking to the PA news agency on the result of the confidence vote, Eustice said: The prime minister won this confidence vote, but, of course, it is always disappointing when you have a significant minority of your own party voting in such a way. So, we have won this vote. We, as a party, we all stood on the same manifesto with the same legislative agenda. What we really need to do now is focus on mending fences, reconciling the party, pulling the party back together so we can all deliver what we were elected to do. Eustice said the result “underlines that as a government we have got to work very hard to reconnect with our own parliamentary party to reunite them behind the agenda we were all elected to deliver”. He added: The prime minister has already started that process, decisions such as the appointment of Steve Barclay as his chief of staff have been a big change, only made only a few months ago and it will take time for that to filter through. But I am aware of people today who said, although they were voting against the prime minister, had he made this change and had a different approach to the parliamentary party a year ago, they might have felt differently. We just need to keep doubling down on that work, reconnect with the party and make sure we go ahead together to deliver on the shared agenda. Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis has said the confidence vote in Boris Johnson was “premature”. Asked what he thought of the result, Davis said: I am unsurprised. You will have heard me earlier saying this was a premature vote. People used to say ‘have you put your letter in?’ I said ‘no, it’s not appropriate at this point in time because this was the predictable outcome’. We are now left with a slight limbo for a year. And, of course, we have still got the Privileges Committee hanging. When asked if he concerned by the result, Davis told PA News: No. The party has made its decision and, you know, it’s fair enough. It’s what I thought they would decide. I didn’t know what the majority would be but I thought he would win. And that’s the outcome we have got. On Nadine Dorries’ claims that Johnson was being targeted by a “well-organised campaign”, Davis said: I think I would know if it was organised. And no. Not at all. I think you probably got ten different factions. All the very different candidates. They will be talking to each other. So, no. It is almost a definition of disorganisation. PA News has this report on the impact so-called payroll votes may have had on the results of the confidence vote. As many as four in five of the MPs who backed Boris Johnson in the confidence vote may have been on the so-called government “payroll”. Between 160 and 170 MPs currently hold government roles, such as ministers and parliamentary private secretaries, according to analysis by the Institute for Government. It would be hoped by Downing Street that all of these MPs would have backed Johnson in the confidence vote. Were this the case, around 80% of the 211 MPs who voted for the prime minister in Monday’s ballot could be said to have done so chiefly out of duty rather than loyalty. The rest of the 211 MPs who said they had confidence in Johnson will have been backbench MPs who are not on the payroll. But with as many as 170 payroll votes supporting the prime minister, the figures suggest only a few dozen non-payroll votes also voted in favour, implying that Johnson has lost the confidence of the majority of the Conservative backbenchers. Boris Johnson insisted it was an “extremely good” result despite a worse performance than Theresa May in the confidence vote. He told reporters in Downing Street: I think it’s an extremely good, positive, conclusive, decisive result which enables us to move on, to unite and to focus on delivery and that is exactly what we are going to do. He ruled out a snap election in order to gain a new mandate from the public, insisting he was focused on the public’s priorities. The prime minister said: I see no point in focusing on anything else and I’m certainly not interested in snap elections. What I’m interested in is delivering right now for the people of this country. Nicola Sturgeon has pointed out that only only two of the 59 Scottish MPs have confidence in the prime minister. She called Boris Johnson “an utterly lame duck” prime minister. Here is my colleague Martin Kettle’s analysis of the results tonight. He said: After a snap contest whose abbreviated timetable was tailored to his advantage, Boris Johnson won the vote of confidence tonight only by 211 to 148 votes, with all 359 Conservative MPs casting ballots. It is a win, but it is also a disaster for the prime minister. The real victor in the 2022 Tory leadership confidence vote was not Johnson. He is irreparably damaged. Politicians don’t recover from such things. Nor was the victor the Conservative party. The winners were the parties of opposition: Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the nationalists. That is because, with the unpopular Johnson losing his electoral allure but now reconfirmed, but only just, as Tory leader, the opposition parties are now on course to oust the Conservatives from office in the next general election. A new Tory leader might have had time to rebuild the party’s image. Johnson cannot do that. Read more here: The SNP’s leader in Westminster has said Douglas Ross’ position as the Scottish Tory leader is “completely untenable” after Boris Johnson won a vote of confidence. Ian Blackford, after the result was announced, said: Tory MPs should have drawn a line under Boris Johnson’s disastrous time as prime minister but instead they’ve bottled it – allowing this damaging circus to continue and leaving the Westminster government in crisis. The UK is now stuck in limbo with a lame duck prime minister who has lost the confidence of the public – and more than forty per cent of his own MPs – and is left limping around on borrowed time while the Tory party descends into bitter division. As for Douglas Ross, his position is completely untenable. If he had any principles or dignity he should quit as Scottish Tory leader. He has made himself look utterly ridiculous by flip-flopping over Boris Johnson’s future and will have no authority or credibility if he tries to cling on. This is Nicola Slawson and I’m taking over from Andrew for the next few hours and will be covering the reaction to tonight’s results. In a statement Keir Starmer for broadcasters said it was “grotesque” that Tory MPs voted to support someone with no sense of duty. He said: Conservative MPs made their choice tonight. They have ignored the British public and hitched themselves and their party firmly to Boris Johnson and all he represents. The Conservative party now believes that good government focused on improving lives is too much to ask. The Conservative party now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law. The Conservative party now believes that the British public have no right to expect honest politicians. Over the weekend the whole country celebrated the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. It was a tribute to 70 years of humility, decency and respect. A reminder of our common cause to build a better a country for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. It is grotesque that the very next day the Conservative party has chosen to throw that sense of duty and those values on the bonfire. Starmer also said the choice in British politics was clearer than ever before. He said: A Labour party united under my leadership with a plan to ensure Britain is never again plunged into a cost of living crisis, focused on growing the economy so that we can afford world class schools and hospitals, and determined to restore trust in politics. Or a Conservative party that is divided, propping up Boris Johnson with no plan to tackle the issues facing you and your family. I don’t claim that I or my party will get everything right, but I promise that when we don’t we will always be honest with you. We will prioritise your prosperity and your security, and we will treat you with the respect you deserve from your politicians. This sounds like an update of David Cameron’s famous tweet before the 2015 general election saying the country faced a choice between his strong and stable government or “chaos with Ed Miliband”. That turned out to be one of the most hopeless predictions in modern politics. That is all from me for today. My collaegue Nicola Slawson is taking over now. From my colleague Jessica Elgot Here is my colleague John Crace’s sketch on today’s no-confidence vote. And here is John’s conclusion. At 9pm on the dot, Brady announced the result. 211 for, 148 against. As expected The Convict had won the vote but lost the leadership. Worse even than the Maybot back in 2018. Johnson would say he was going to hang on – he’s a bad loser – but there was no coming back from this. It may be weeks, it may be months but Boris is toast. And the Tories would spend the time fighting each other to the death. While the country is on its knees. At a standstill. What a legacy. Johnson must be so proud. In a clip for broadcasters Boris Johnson has described the result as “good news” because, he claimed, it would allow the government to put Partygate behind it and to focus on “what we as a government are doing to help people”. He said that he had the support of a greater proportion of his parliamentary colleagues than when he stood for the leadership in 2019. Asked if he would rule out a snap election, Johnson sidestepped the question, and repeated the point about how he would now be able to focus on the issues important to him, not issues of interest to the media. Pressed again about a snap election, he said he was “certainly not interested in snap elections”. Asked if this was the best possible result for the Labour party, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, told Sky News that this was an issue that was beyond party politics and that Boris Johnson should have left office some time ago. Many commentators would argue that this isn’t beyond party politics, and that in fact it is a terrific result for Labour. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, told Sky News that Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, would be “punching the air” tonight because his ally, Boris Johnson, will remain as PM tomorrow. Starting an instant spin operation outside the room where the result was announced, the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly called it “a comfortable win” and said rebels should now give up on their efforts. He said: I think the country would rightly be very upset if we as a party decided to ignore what the wider party said when they elected him leader, what the country said when they made him prime minister, and what the bulk of Conservative MP have now said today. People have got to recognise, they didn’t get the vote of no confidence through, what they should now do is say, OK, we respect the democratic decision of the party, we’re going to support the prime minister getting on with his job. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the result of the no-confidence ballot. There is a general consensus that, while Boris Johnson may have won, he has not done well enough to quash the turmoil surrounding his leadership. From the BBC’s Chris Mason From Sky’s Beth Rigby From the Spectator’s James Forsyth From Lucy Fisher from Times Radio From the FT’s Jim Pickard From the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges From Bloomberg’s Kitty Donaldson From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope From Alan White from Politics Home Boris Johnson’s allies think his critics should now accept the result and support Boris Johnson as leader going into the next election. But Sir Roger Gale, one of the leading critics of Johnson, has just told Sky News that he will continue to oppose Johnson being party leader and continue to voice his opinion. UPDATE: Gale said: Unfortunately, the issue can’t be settled like that. Over a third of the parliamentary party has expressed no confidence in the prime minister ... I don’t believe that he should take the party into the next general election and I think there are other elephant traps down the road - two by-elections coming up, the privileges committee report in the autumn - there are a lot of hurdles ahead and I think a prime minister of honour would look at the figures, accept the fact that he has lost the support of a significant proportion of his party and consider his position, but I don’t think he’ll do that. This is from Rory Stewart, the former Tory international trade secretary who stood against Boris Johnson for the Tory leadership in 2019. Stewart subsequently left the party over Johnson’s Brexit policies. But Steward is assuming that the payroll vote all supported Johnson. We don’t know that, and it seems unlikely. The 1922 Committee made an effort to ensure it was a genuinely secret vote. Keir Starmer says today’s result shows the country faces a choice between “divided Tories” and a “united Labour party”. After announcing the numbers, Sir Graham Brady said that meant the Conservative party has confidence in Boris Johnson. There was loud, and sustained desk banging from Johnson’s supporters. But by no stretch can this be described as a good result for Johnson. He has lost the support of a larger proportion of the parliamentary party than Theresa May did when she faced a no-confidence vote in 2018. Within eight months of that result, May was out. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, says 359 votes were cast. There were no spoilt ballots. Confidence in Boris Johnson: 211 No confidence in Johnson: 148 That means more than 40% of Tory MPs voted against Johnson. Another lull in the noise level. Perhaps those at the other end of the room can see something we can’t. It started to go quiet a moment ago in committee room 14. The volume is back up. But the announcement is imminent. From my colleague Peter Walker Committee room 14 is set up like a mini chamber, with rows of desks facing each other, for debatings, and a visitors’ gallery area at the end for people who are watching. The windows look out onto the Thames. They have just admitted the journalists, and we’re now sitting in the gallery seats. The main area has been reserved for Tory MPs. There must be 70 or so of them here. Some are sitting, some are standing and mingling. The atmosphere is more excited than tense. In the Commons there is now a large crowd of journalists outside the door to committee room 14, which has been chosen as the room where the result will be announced because it is about the biggest committee room in the Commons. We have been told that about 40 journalists will be let in. There are about that number, or more, outside, and an orderly queue it certainly isn’t. Boris Johnson’s team think he has won the vote, the BBC’s Nick Eardley reports. But the big question, of course, is whether it will be a convincing, political win - or a narrow, technical win that could herald government paralysis (see 7.49pm) and guerilla war in the party (see 8.36pm). The Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker has said that he expects Boris Johnson to win tonight, but that the result could lead to “guerilla war” in the party. He told Channel 4 News: I think the prime minister will win tonight, absolutely I think he’ll win, but really the important thing is what happens afterwards with the parliamentary party. Does the parliamentary party say ‘right, OK, we’ve had the confidence vote, is it now time to move on, get behind the prime minister?’ Or will there be a temptation to have a rolling maul, a guerrilla war, for the next six, 12, 18, 24 months? Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, is enjoying the news that some of Boris Johnson’s allies are complaining about MPs not telling the truth. Nicholas Watt from BBC’s Newsnight is also picking up gloom from the Boris Johnson camp. And this is from my colleague Aubrey Allegretti. These are from Harry Lambert at the New Statesman. In a post on Facebook, the Conservative MP Dehenna Davison says she voted against Boris Johnson tonight. Many of you have understandably asked how I intended to vote in this evening’s confidence ballot in the prime minister. Though it is a secret ballot, it feels right to share with you how I voted. This is not a decision I took lightly. I listened carefully to all sides, and particularly to the many constituents who contacted me sharing their thoughts and experiences. Weighing it all up, I voted against the prime minister tonight. I hope that, whatever the result, we politicians can now fully focus on the things we were elected to do for you. (And that is why I won’t be commenting further on this now!) Davison is a classic “red wall” MP, representing Bishop Auckland, which had been Labour since the 1930s until Davison won it in 2019. But Davison had been identified in reports as one of the 2019 intake mobilising against Johnson earlier this year. The ballot has now closed. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee, arrived a few minutes ago to join the counting. There are no more MPs outside committee room 10 and the journalists are heading off to grab something to eat. Gavin Barwell, the Tory peer who was chief of staff to Theresa May when she was PM, has posted his analysis on Twitter of what would amount to a good or bad result for Boris Johnson tonight. Barwell, who is a regular critic of Johnson’s, says that fewer than 100 votes against the PM would be a good result for him, more than 133 votes against would be “the beginning of the end”, and that more than 144 votes against ought to finish him off (but probably won’t). And David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, told LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr that he thought Boris Johnson would win technically, but not politcally, in the vote tonight. He explained: I think Boris will win technically, but I think it will be a psychological defeat, in the sense of a very large number of people are voting against, probably more than are expected. I suspect quite a lot of ministers who are obviously publicly saying they’re voting one way will vote the other. Somebody said to me a third will be in that position. Davis, who has said Boris Johnson should quit, suggested the vote was taking place too early. Some of the PM’s critics think they would have had more chance of winning a no-confidence vote after the two byelections later this month, in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton, both of which the Tories are expected to lose. Davis said a Johnson victory tonight could lead to paralysis in government. He explained: The real problem with calling this early is that we may end up with a sort of paralysed government or a populist government, where everything they do is just designed to carry favour with one sector of the population or another, and that’s quite dangerous. That’s where governments go wrong. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, told LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr that he thought Boris Johnson could bounce back and win an election for the Tories. But he also claimed that the party had no alternative to sticking with him as leader. He told the programme: People have written [Johnson] off before many times. And he’s come back and I think he’s absolutely the right person to come back and to win and the point that you made in your opening remarks was quite right. I mean, we don’t have an alternative. I think the idea that we spend three months or whatever it might be, finding a new leader and all that, going through all of that beauty contest, is absurd. Laurence Robertson, the leave-voting MP for Tewkesbury who backed Boris Johnson for the Tory leadership in 2019, has said that he could not support the PM tonight. Another Scottish Tory, Andrew Bowie, says he has voted against Boris Johnson. That means four of the six Scottish Conservative MPs have come out against Boris Johnson. The others are Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader (see 4.45pm), John Lamont (see 7.17pm) and David Mundell (see 7.19pm). Insider’s Henry Dyer (who has been counting) reckons 300 Tory MPs have now voted. Another Scottish Tory, the former Scottish secretary David Mundell, has declared that he voted against Boris Johnson. Here is the letter from John Lamont explaining why is voting against Boris Johnson, which has led to him resigning as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Liz Truss. Lamont is MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. Most Scottish MSPs are thought to be opposed to Boris Johnson, and Douglas Ross - who sits as an MP and an MSP, and who is leader of the Scottish Tories - declared earlier that he was voting against Johnson. (See 4.45pm.) And Boris Johnson has now left. He did not stop to talk to reporters as he headed down the committee corridor. Boris Johnson has arrived to vote. He turned up with Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Andrew Griffith, his chief of staff. There did not seem to be a queue at the time and he got straight in. Back outside committee room 10 the queue did clear for a moment (as Sir Bernard Jenkin went in), but another handful of MPs have now arrived. However, it is all slowing down. Voting is no longer “brisk”. Some readers have asked what will happen if the no-confidence vote is tied. This was raised at a briefing where a senior party figure explained the process to journalists. They would not say. The reply was along the lines of: “We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it.” Theresa May refused to say how she voted as she left committee room 10, PA Media reports. She said she was not “answering any questions”. John Lamont has resigned as a PPS because he will be voting against Boris Johnson, ITV’s Peter Smith reports. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister who has called for Boris Johnson to go, told reporters after hearing Boris Johnson address the Conservative 1922 Committee earlier that it was a “very, very sad day”. He said it was “highly likely” that Johnson would “formally win” the vote. But he went on: What that means over the months ahead, I don’t know. What I am certain of is that the Conservative party’s got to find a way to raise our standard of conduct in all things - not only amongst ministers, but amongst backbenchers, particularly when they give comment to all of you [the media]. Back at the committee room 10 doorstep, Michael Ellis, the paymaster general, has arrived. He says he has never had to queue before for one of these votes. There are about 20 people waiting to get in. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak will lay out “the plan for growth” next week, with a “broad outline of the prime minister’s vision across the board”, PA Media reports. PA says: The PM did not promise a “specific tax cut” during a meeting of the 1922 Committee earlier, a senior Tory party source said source said, but there is a “very big speech by him and the chancellor on the economy” on the way. Johnson also spoke of another planned announcement with the levelling up secretary on housing. He told MPs: “If I am here later this week - and I very much hope that I will be - Michael Gove and I will be setting out plans to kindle that dream of home ownership in the hearts of millions who currently believe it is beyond their means.” And on tax Johnson told his MPs: And then there is one chunk of household income that is the biggest of all, and that is tax. Everyone understands the fiscal impact of Covid, the cost of clearing the backlogs. But the way out now is to drive supply side reform on Conservative principles and to cut taxes and to drive investment in the UK. Theresa May has arrived to vote. She looks like she has dressed for a special occasion - presumably a dinner engagement later although, given her feelings about Boris Johnson, perhaps the no-confidence ballot itself is a moment for celebration. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, arrives to join a queue that is diminishing. He says he will be voting for the “right side” (which no doubt is what his opponents think they are doing too). Back outside committee room 10 the queue is still about 30 deep, but it is moving a bit more quickly. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has arrived. Penny Mordaunt is in the queue behind him. The mood is more upbeat than you might expect. MPs, wherever their loyalities lie, a bit of excitement ... In his speech to Tory MPs earlier Boris Johnson promised to use deregulation to cut the cost of living for people. According to a text of his remarks released to journalists, he said: Why should the cost of transport be inflated by outdated practices that have nothing to do with safety? Why should the cost of childcare be pushed up by unnecessary rules on child-minding? Why should the cost of energy be pushed by everything from the life cycles of the crustacea that may form on the legs of offshore windmills to the system that enables all electricity producers to charge the top marginal rate? This is from the Daily Mail’s John Stevens, who has been keeping a tally of MPs declaring their support for Boris Johnson. (See 5.13pm.) Jeremy Hunt is in the queue now, talking to another Tory MP who is not backing Boris Johnson, John Baron. Hunt is reminiscing about his appearance at the Hay literary festival. There must be about 25 to 30 Tory MPs queuing up to vote now, with a slightly smaller crowd of journalists standing on the other side of the corridor. Some of the MPs are talking to journalists. There is quite a lot of chat going on, but (from what I’ve heard) it is mostly mundane. Having been about the third person to go in, Grant Shapps has rejoined the queue. “Vote early, vote often,” seems to be his motto, but a colleague tells me this is what MPs have to do when using a proxy vote for someone else. They cannot get issued with two ballot papers at the same time. There are now more than a dozen Tory MPs in the queue to vote. Sir Peter Bottomley went in first. (The MPs are being allowed in one by one at the moment.) Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, Sir Roger Gale, a leading critic of Boris Johnson’s, Robert Halfon, chair of the education committee, and Peter Bone are among those in the crowd. Tory MPs are voting in committee room 10 in the House of Commons. It is not the larger committee room 14, which is normally used for big meetings of MPs and which is the room that will be used for the declaration of the result at 9pm. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, has arrived to vote and he is waiting on a bench, reading a copy of the Evening Standard. He won’t say how he’s voting. From my colleague Rowena Mason The Labour party has said that tomorrow it will force a vote in the Commons on a motion saying the government should implement in full recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life proposing to beef up the ministerial code. Boris Johnson was widely criticised last week when he issued a revised draft of the code that ignored many of these recommendations and effectively watered down the code in some respects. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: The Committee on Standards in Public Life was founded by Sir John Major a quarter of a century ago but its role has never been more important in upholding standards in the wake of sleaze, scandal and shame. Labour is urging MPs of all parties to support this independent, cross-party package of reforms to tackle decaying standards. if they fail to back this move to clean up politics, it is they who will have to look their constituents in the eye. The prime minister did not greet his Estonian counterpart outside the door of No 10 seemingly to avoid journalists ahead of the no-confidence motion tonight, PA Media reports. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, was visiting Downing Street to speak with Boris Johnson about strengthening the Nato alliance against Russian aggression, and she did not receive a handshake outside in a marked break from protocol. Kallas instead waved to cameras on her entrance and spoke briefly with the press after their meeting, which lasted around 20 minutes and was mostly in private. The Estonian leader tentatively told the media that Johnson was in “good” spirits. The Conservative MP Sir Robert Syms says he will vote against Boris Johnson this evening. George Grylls from the Times has more detail of the “who hasn’t got pissed?” comment from a senior Tory source speaking to journalists about the PM’s meeting with Conservative MPs. (See 5.03pm.) John Stevens from the Daily Mail has been keeping a tally of Tory MPs who have said publicly that they will vote for Boris Johnson and he is still more than 50 short of the 180 Johnson needs to be sure of victory. When Stevens conducted a similar exercise in 2018, Theresa May had got the number of public endorsements she needed from her MPs by lunchtime on the day of the no-confidence vote. (See 1.48pm.) Boris Johnson’s declaration to Tory MPs (as reported by Patrick Maguire from the Times) that he would “do it again” regarding Partygate may turn out to be a major blunder. Presumably he was thinking primarily of his attendance at various leaving events, for which he was not fined and which he defended on the grounds that, as a leader, it was important for morale to thank departing staff. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand. These are from the Mirror’s Pippa Crerar. UPDATE: Ben Riley-Smith from the Telegraph has posted this on the context for Johnson’s remark. This is from James Forsyth, the Spectator’s political editor. Boris Johnson has now finished speaking to Conservative MPs. These are from journalists doorstepping the meeting who have been trying to find out how his speech was received. From my colleague Rowena Mason From the Times’ Patrick Maguire From ITV’s Robert Peston From Insider’s Cat Neilan From the i’s Paul Waugh Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, has announced that he will vote against Boris Johnson tonight. Ross was one of the first Tory MPs to call for Johnson to go when the Partygate story escalated at the start of the year. Then, after Russia invaded Ukraine, he changed his mind and said that it would be wrong to replace Johnson with the war ongoing. He even withdrew the letter he had submitted calling for a no-confidence vote, attracting derision from his opponents in Scotland. This is from the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar on the game of expectation management being played by both sides today. Here is more from journalists who have been doorstepping Boris Johnson’s meeting with Conservative MPs. According to Sky’s Beth Rigby, Boris Johnson will tell Tory MPs that under his leadership the Conservatives won their biggest electoral victory in 40 years. Johnson’s speeches often contain statements that are not true, and this is no exception. Margaret Thatcher won majorities of 144 and 102 in 1983 and 1987 respectively, and so Johnson delivered the best result in 30 years, not 40 years. Perhaps it was a typo. The reference to the single market is a jibe at Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the Commons defence committee who last week suggested rejoining it. Boris Johnson has arrived to address a meeting of Conservative MPs in private. These are from some of the journalists doorstepping the room where this is happening. The ConservativeHome website has now released the results of its own poll of members on whether or not Tory MPs should vote to remove Boris Johnson and this shows a narrow majority (55%) saying they should get rid of him. Another 41% say the MPs should back him. This is worse for Johnson than the YouGov poll covering the same question (see 3.38pm) which found a narrow majority of members saying MPs should not remove Johnson. It is hard to poll party members propery (because there are relatively few of them), but the ConservativeHome results have a good track record - and their sample today involved more than twice as many members as YouGov’s. This is from the anaysis of the findings by Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor. This is the first time that the panel has concluded that [Johnson] should go, though the prime minister was at the foot of our Cabinet League Table last month, and in negative ratings. To say that the position has worsened for him again since May 29, the date of our last survey, is a statement of the obvious, and I won’t attempt an exhaustive analysis of why this might be so. Other than to point out that the long period of Jubilee celebration hasn’t done him any good with the panel. For better or worse, party members don’t have a vote later today, and MPs must ultimately make what they believe is the right decision for the country (or so we hope). But at over a thousand replies in a day this is a very substantial survey return – our highest this year. And, for the record, the panel hasn’t changed much since it gave Johnson a 93 point approval rating in the wake of the 2019 general election. Twenty-two Conservative party donors who have collectively given the party more than £18m in recent years have signed a joint letter backing Boris Johnson, the Sun’s Harry Cole reports. According to a snap YouGov poll, Conservative party members are split over whether or not their MPs should vote against Boris Johnson. A narrow majority (53%) support Johnson, the poll suggests, but 42% think he should be removed. But the same poll suggests members think the Conservatives would be more likely to form a government after the next election under a different leader. As for who that leader should be, there is no consensus, but Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, are the top three. Only 500 Conservative party members participated in the YouGov poll. The ConservativeHome website also polls Tory members on this and in the past its surveys have provided a good guide to the outcome on party leadership and selection contests. When it asked in December who the next party leader should be, Truss came out top. ConservativeHome polls more regularly on how members think cabinet ministers are performing, and last week Wallace was well ahead of everyone else on this measure. From the Times’ Steven Swinford These are from Lucy Fisher from Times Radio on how the vote will be conducted this evening. In the past, when a Tory prime minister could only be challenged by someone issuing a leadership challenge, representatives of the candidates were allowed to witness the voting. That meant a government whip was in the room and, although it was a secret vote, it was easy for MPs to show the whip their ballot paper. Now the rules are intended to ensure that MPs really can vote in private. It is often assumed that the 160-plus MPs on the payroll vote - ministers, PPSs, trade envoys and Conservative party vice chairs - will automatically support the PM. In a genuinely secret ballot, Boris Johnson cannot be confident they will. Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister who ignored the no-confidence vote in a message she posted on Twitter this morning (see 10.29am), has now retweeted an article from her local paper in which she says Boris Johnson “has always had my loyalty”. She told the Portsmouth News: I didn’t choose this prime minister, I didn’t support him in the leadership contest but he has always had my loyalty because I think that’s what you do when you have a democratic process – you select a leader and then you owe that person your loyalty. That’s always been my approach, whatever differences I’ve had with people and that remains. I’m one of his ministers and I have continued to support him. It is hard to be sure, but there may be some significance in the way she has phrased this (using the present perfect tense). She could just say she continues to support him. According to a snap Opinium poll carried out today, 59% of people, including 34% of Conservative voters, think Tory MPs should vote against Boris Johnson tonight. The key question, of course, raised by Will Walden’s interview (see 2.31pm) is what would count as a “significant number” of votes against Boris Johnson. On BBC News a few minutes ago Daniel Finkelstein, the Conservative peer and Times columnist, said that if between 120 and 130 Tory MPs were to vote against Johnson that would be “seriously problematic”. Will Walden, who worked for Boris Johnson as a communications adviser when Johnson was London mayor and foreign secretary, told the World at One that there was no chance of Johnson agreeing to resign if he wins the vote tonight, but not by much. He explained: Boris will be taken kicking and screaming out of the front door of Number 10. There is no way that the thing that he has wanted all his life he is going to give up easily on ... Boris Johnson does not do reverse gear. He only does forward gear, and his mantra is plough on. Whatever the problem, plough on. Whatever the result, he will say it’s done and dusted, on we go. The idea that Boris Johnson is going to go is for the birds, and it will take several people with revolvers in the room to convince him to go. But Walden also said that a significant vote against Johnson would ultimately prove fatal, even if technically he won. He said: A significant number of votes against him, even if it’s nowhere near a majority, then it’s death by a thousand cuts. Will those rebels withhold their support in parliament? History does dictate that if a prime minister survives a confidence vote but doesn’t survive it convincingly, then ultimately you bleed to death. Anything less than a convincing win tonight will not do what they’re seeking to do, which is to put this to bed. These are from the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith on how Boris Johnson was told there would be a no-confidence vote. This may explain why at certain points Johnson looked rather glum when he was attending the platinum jubilee pageant yesterday. Most cabinet ministers have posted messages on Twitter expressing support for the PM. Here is a selection. From Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister From Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary From Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary From Grant Shapps, the transport secretary From Ben Wallace, the defence secretary From the Times’ Patrick Maguire Andrew Mitchell, the former Conservative chief whip, told the World at One that even if Boris Johnson won tonight, it would be a Pyrrhic victory. I very much fear if he does win tonight it will be a Pyrrhic victory. He needs to look himself in the mirror and ask himself what is in the best interests of our country and of our party. Mitchell said that after a visit he made to a beacon-lighting event in his Sutton Coldfield constituency to mark the platinum jubilee, it was clear the public had turned against the PM. As I walked through the crowd it was very clear that the prime minister has not only lost the dressing room he has also lost quite a lot of people in the stands. Mitchell said in January that Johnson no longer had his support, but he told the programme that he had not written a letter to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, requesting a no-confidence vote. John Stevens, the Daily Mail journalist who has been keeping a tally of the Conservative MPs saying that they will back Boris Johnson in the vote tonight, has just told Radio 4’s World at One that when he conducted a similar exercise on the day of the no-confidence vote in Theresa May, by lunchtime she had already received enough public endorsements to be confident of victory. But Johnson is nowhere near that point, Stevens said. Johnson needs at least 180 votes to be confident of winning. At the moment he is just at the halfway point, according to Stevens’ count. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, has issued a statement urging Tory MPs - and particularly the Scottish ones - to vote against Boris Johnson. He said: Boris Johnson is completely unfit to be prime minister and he should have been removed from office long ago. He has broken the law, lied to parliament and distracted the UK government from tackling the issues that matter, including the Tory cost of living crisis and the long-term damage caused by Brexit. Tory MPs must finally put the interests of the public first. They must vote Boris Johnson out and do it now. And there cannot be any more flip-flopping from Douglas Ross and the Scottish Tories. Ross has made himself and the Tory Holyrood group look utterly ridiculous, while the rest of the spineless Scottish Tory MPs have shown nothing but craven loyalty to Boris Johnson – it is way past time for all of them to finally do the right thing and vote him out of office. According to the BBC’s political editor, Chris Mason, Nadine Dorries’ Twitter diatribe against Jeremy Hunt this morning (see 1.35pm), may have backfired. On Radio 4’s World at One Mason also said Boris Johnson spent an hour this morning personally signing the letters he has sent out to all Tory MPs asking for their support. (See 11.31am.) Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, has responded to Jeremy Hunt’s declaration that he will vote against Boris Johnson tonight (see 11.20am) by unleashing a ferocious attack on him, accusing him of “duplicity”, saying that he has been “wrong about almost everything” and arguing that the handling of Covid would have been a “disaster” if Hunt had been in charge. Dorries has been an admirer of Johnson’s for years and, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, is unlikely to remain in the cabinet under any other Tory leader. An animal lover, earlier this year she joked that the only thing that might stop her backing him would be if he kicked a dog. Recently it emerged that Johnson got so angry with his own dog, Dilyn, he suggested it should be put down, but Dorries’s loyalty does not seem to have weakened. The number of votes against Boris Johnson tonight is most likely to fall within the 100 to 149 bracket, according to the odds offered by Ladbrokes. This is what they are offering. 0-49 - 66/1 50-99 - 3/1 100-149 - 15/8 150-199 - 2/1 200-249 - 5/1 250-299 - 16/1 300+ - 100/1 Boris Johnson (or his social media manager) has been tweeting about the PM’s conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They do speak often, but No 10 does seem particularly keen to publicise these conversations on days when Johnson’s leadership is being questioned. The Johnson Twitter account has also posted about Wales qualifying for the World Cup. Here is John Penrose explaining why he resigned as the government’s anti-corruption champion. (See 11.44am.) The Daily Mail’s John Stevens has a long Twitter thread noting Tory MPs who have publicly said they will vote for Boris Johnson tonight. He is currently on 79. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, has been giving interviews this morning defending Boris Johnson. He is one of the cabinet ministers most loyal to Johnson, which critics claim is not wholly unrelated to his status as one of the ministers most likely to be sacked under another Tory leader. Here are some of the main points he made. Rees-Mogg claimed that, if Johnson were replaced, Brexit would not be delivered. “I also think that, without Boris Johnson, Brexit will not be delivered,” he said. The UK has already left the EU, and so Brexit is supposed to have been delivered anyway, but Rees-Mogg was implying that the full advantanges of Brexit, as he sees them (divergence from EU regulations) would not be delivered under another leader. He implied the campaign to get rid of Johnson was being driven by remainers. “It is in the remainer interest [to get rid of Johnson],” he said. When it was put to him that many of the Tory MPs opposed to Johnson are Brexiters, he said opposition to Brexit “is what underlies a significant number of people involved”. He cited Tobias Ellwood and Jeremy Hunt as examples. He went on: You’ve got people who are pro the European Union who are campaigning to get to the prime minister. I think it’s perfectly reasonable to join the dots. He said that he was wrong in December 2018 when he said that Theresa May should resign after the no-confidence vote which she won, with 63% of Tory MPs backing her and 37% not supporting her. He said that comment was his “greatest mistake” at the time because “in a democracy one is enough”. He claimed that Johnson would be able to continue as prime minister even if he won tonight’s vote by just one vote. He played down the significance of the vote being called in the first place. He said: I don’t think getting to the 15% bar is particularly damaging, or indeed particularly surprising. I think it’s a relatively low bar and fairly easy to get to ... The thing about 15% is it means 85% on the other side of the equation. In fact, we don’t know how many letters were received by Sir Graham Brady, and so it could well be more than 15%. Yesterday the Sunday Times reported claims that 67 letters had been submitted, which would be almost 19%. And Rees-Mogg claimed that the fact that Johnson received “a little bit of booing” when he arrived at St Paul’s Cathedral for the service for the Queen’s platinum jubilee was “perfectly normal”. When Sky News played the clip to him, he accused them of turning up the volume to make it sound worse than it was. He said: Turning the volume up to get your readers to be too concerned about that – that was a bit miserable really. Angela Richardson, the Conservative MP for Guildford, has issued a statement on Facebook saying she will vote against Boris Johnson this evening. She explains: From the very beginning of the issues surrounding the prime minister’s conduct during the lockdown period and his subsequent answers to parliamentary questions, I have been consistent in my views about the standards people expect of those in high office. Last week, I made a statement following the publication of the full Sue Gray report that questioned whether those standards had been upheld. The deep disappointment I expressed in a previous statement in January has not abated. Given that, I will be voting no confidence in Boris Johnson this evening. Boris Johnson has had one of his regular calls with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainain president, this morning. Here is an extract from the readout issued by a No 10 spokesperson. The prime minister said the UK continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine and extended his condolences to all Ukrainian families who have lost loved ones in the war. He set out the significant new support the government is providing, including long-range multiple-launch rocket systems to strike Russian artillery positions which are being used to bombard Ukrainian towns. The leaders also discussed diplomatic negotiations and efforts to end the damaging Russian blockade of Ukraine’s grain exports. They agreed to intensify work with other allies, including G7 leaders, to drive progress on ending Russia’s illegal invasion and supporting Ukraine’s economy. The prime minister closed by offering his commiserations to the Ukrainian national football team on being knocked out of World Cup qualifiers. He reiterated his admiration for the Ukrainian people’s strength and national spirit in the face of Russian brutality. John Penrose told BBC News that he decided to resign as the government’s anti-corruption champion last week (see 11.44am) but that he did not announce it then because of the Queen’s platinum jubilee. He wrote his resignation letter yesterday, he said, before he knew a no-confidence vote was taking place this week. The Conservative MP John Penrose has released an open letter to Boris Johnson announcing his resignation as the government’s anti-corruption champion. Penrose says his decision was prompted by the Sue Gray report, which he says implied Johnson broke the ministerial code over Partygate, and by Johnson’s comments on this in a letter to Lord Geidt, his independent adviser on ministerial standards, last week. Here is an extract from the letter. My reason for stepping down is your public letter last week, replying to your independent adviser on the ministerial code about the recent Sue Gray report into ‘partygate’. In it you addressed the concerns over the fixed penalty notice you paid, but not the broader and very serious criticisms of what the report called ‘failures of leadership and judgment’ and its conclusion that ‘senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture’. You will know (and your letter to your adviser on the ministerial code explicitly says) that the Nolan principles of public life are absolutely central to the ministerial code, and that the seventh of them is ‘leadership’. So the only fair conclusion to draw from the Sue Gray report is that you have breached a fundamental principle of the ministerial code - a clear resigning matter. But your letter to your independent adviser on the ministerial code ignores this absolutely central, non-negotiable issue completely. And, if it had addressed it, it is hard to see how it could have reached any other conclusion than that you had broken the code. And here is the full text of it. In a letter to Conservative MPs Boris Johnson claims he has shown that he can be “trusted to deliver bold and innovative solutions to difficult and longstanding problems”. He accepts that some of the criticism of him over Partygate was fair. But he says he has responded to that, and he claims that the party now has a “golden chance” to put the issue behind it. I know that over recent months I have come under a great deal of fire, and I know that experience has been painful for the whole party. Some of that criticism has perhaps been fair, some less so. Where there have been valid points, I have listened and learned and made significant changes. And I will of course continue to listen and learn from colleagues about the improvements you wish to see. But I cannot stress too much that we have a golden chance to put this behind us now. With your support, I believe that tonight we have a great prize within our grasp. We can put an end to the media’s favourite obsession. We can get on with the job without the noises off. And I am absolutely confident that if we can unite in the days ahead then in due course we will win again, repay the trust of the 14 million who voted for us, and continue to serve the country we love. Johnson’s critics, of course, also argue that the no-confidence vote offers Tory MPs a golden opportunity to move on from Partygate. Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary who is one of the favourites to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory leader, has said he will vote against the PM in tonight’s no-confidence vote. In a statement posted on Twitter as a thread he said: The Conservative party must now decide if it wishes to change its leader. Because of the situation in Ukraine this was not a debate I wanted to have now but under our rules we must do that. Having been trusted with power, Conservative MPs know in our hearts we are not giving the British people the leadership they deserve. We are not offering the integrity, competence and vision necessary to unleash the enormous potential of our country. And because we are no longer trusted by the electorate, who know this too, we are set to lose the next general election. Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer and more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told LBC during his “Call Keir” phone-in this morning that, even if Boris Johnson wins the vote tonight, it will mark the beginning of the end for him. He told LBC: I think the mood has changed. I think the public have made their mind up about this man. They don’t think he’s really telling the truth about many, many things - not just Partygate - but just the general sense that this man doesn’t really tell the truth, [he] can’t be trusted. We’ve got a prime minister trying to cling on to his job and most people would say ‘your job is to help me through the cost-of-living crisis and you’re not doing it because you’re distracted’. I think history tells us that this is the beginning of the end. If you look at the previous examples of no-confidence votes, even when Conservative prime ministers survived those, he might survive it tonight, the damage is already done and usually they fall reasonably swiftly afterwards. There are 359 Conservative MPs and so Boris Johnson needs at least 180 votes to be sure of winning. But, as Starmer points out, a technical win is not necessarily a political victory, and the last Conservative prime minister to win a vote of confidence like this (Theresa May, on 12 December 2018) was out of office less than eight months later. At the weekend Tim Shipman from the Sunday Times produced some benchmarks that would show whether or not Johnson is doing worse than May in 2018, John Major in 1995 and Margaret Thatcher in 1990. (The latter two are not exact parallels because they were facing a leadership challenge, not a no confidence vote.) Boris Johnson (or the person who manages his social media) has also been tweeting today about a defence matter, rather than the no-confidence vote. His supporters claim that the leadership he has shown over the war in Ukraine is one of the reasons for retaining him in office. Penny Mordaunt, the former defence secretary who is now an international trade minister, has been written up in the media as a potential surprise, unity candidate to replace Boris Johnson. She is a Brexiter but is well regarded by Tory remainers and one nation-types. She has been tweeting today - but not about her support for the PM. Tory MPs have been told that if they take a picture of their ballot paper their vote will be invalid, ITV’s Anushka Asthana reports. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has stressed this to ensure that MPs do not come under pressure from No 10 to produce evidence that they actually did vote for Boris Johnson. In the past Tory prime ministers have often found that the number of MPs saying they will support them in a leadership contest, or a no confidence ballot, is not the same as the number who actually do. This is from Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader. He is echoing the line used by Labour’s Wes Streeting (see 10.09am), who also said Tory MPs should remove their leader. At one point opinion was divided within the Labour party as to whether it was in their best interests for Johnson to go, or whether Labour would do better at the next election if Johnson were remain in office. Now the evidence is clearer that Johnson is a huge liability for his party. James Johnson, a pollster who used to work for Theresa May in Downing Street, explained why yesterday in a Twitter thread starting here on polling from Wakefield, where a byelection is taking place later this month. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, told Times Radio this morning that voters would judge Conservative MPs “very harshly” if they allowed Boris Johnson to remain in office. He said: Well, they’ve got two choices, no confidence or no backbone. Voters will judge Conservative MPs rightly, very harshly if they stick by this discredited and disgraced prime minister. It’s one thing for Boris Johnson to try and get through this and hope that he can make it through to the next general election and that voters will forgive him. But I don’t think voters will forgive Conservative MPs who when presented with the opportunity to give the country better leadership effectively turn around and say that the Conservative party has no one else available, but Boris Johnson is the best that the Conservative party has to offer. The Jesse Norman letter to Graham Brady calling for a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson is one of the most damning yet published. (See 7.50am.) Much of it could come straight out of a Guardian editorial. Here are some of the main points. Norman says the government under Johnson lacks a “sense of mission” and that “sensible planning has been replaced by empty rhetoric”. He says: You are simply seeking to campaign, to keep changing the subject and to create political and cultural dividing lines mainly for your advantage, at a time when the economy is struggling, inflation is soaring and growth is anaemic at best. Norman says the Sue Gray report revealed “a culture of casual law-breaking at 10 Downing Street in relation to Covid” and that it was “grotesque” for Johnson to claim he had been vindicated by it. Norman says Johnson’s plan to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland protocol would “economically very damaging, politically foolhardy and almost certainly illegal”. He says the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda is “ugly, likely to be counterproductive and of doubtful legality”. He says the Channel 4 privatisation plan is “an unnecessary and provocative attempt to address a political non-issue during a time of crisis, at significant cost to the independent UK film and TV industry”. He says “no genuinely Conservative government” would have passed the ban on noisy protests in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. He says that, contrary to what Johnson claims, there is “zero chance” of the government being able to build a nuclear power station a year over the next decade. He says Johnson is trying to implement in part “a presidential system of government that is entirely foreign to our constitution and law”. And he says that if Johnson were to remain in office a Labour victory at the next general election would be “much more likely”, which would be “potentially catastrophic for this country”. But it is not all negative. Norman praises Johnson for his handling of Ukraine and Covid. As prime minister, you have been dealt a very difficult hand with Covid and Ukraine, and you deserve great credit for much of the way in which the Government has handled these twin crises. Your recent visit to Kyiv was a conspicuous act of leadership. Norman is married to Kate Bingham, who ran the government’s vaccine taskforce. Some readers might wonder why Norman is only saying all this now. In a paragraph that is revealing about how No 10 tried to maintain the loyalty of MPs, Norman says that when he quit the government in last year’s reshuffle, Johnson floated the possibility of him returning, and being given a cabinet job, in the future. Norman implies that he has only recently decided that he would find such an offer unacceptable. He says: When I stepped down from the Treasury last September, you raised the topic of the next reshuffle, and we discussed the potential for me to run a department of state. I have always been deeply committed to public service. But recent events have served to clarify the position this country is in under your leadership, beyond any doubt; and I am afraid I can see no circumstances in which I could serve in a government led by you. Cabinet ministers have been using Twitter to declare their support for Boris Johnson. This is from Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who will certainly stand as a candidate to replace Johnson if he loses. This is from Rishi Sunak, who until recently was seen as a favourite to replace Johnson, and who is still a potential contender. And this is from Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, who in the leadership contest in 2016 famously backed Johnson for leader before withdrawing his support and standing against him. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, responded to the news that a no confidence vote in Boris Johnson will be held tonight by telling the Today programme that this would give the Conservative party a chance to “draw a line” under the recent leadership controversy. He said: I see it as an opportunity. It’s an opportunity for the party to put behind it all this frenzied speculation we’ve had over the last few days and to get behind a programme of delivery ... If [Johnson] wins then that draws a line under this ... As a democratic party, you follow the rules and a win is a win and then we unite behind our leader and keep on delivering - that’s what this is about. Many MPs would argue that, if a leader wins a no confidence vote only narrowly, then they ought to resign anyway because of the damage done to their authority. But Johnson’s allies have been adopting the line used by Javid, that a win is a win, and saying that he will stay on even if his margin of victory is small. This is from my colleague Aubrey Allegretti explaining how the no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson will be carried out. Boris Johnson welcomes the chance to make his case to MPs, Downing Street claims. In a statement a No 10 spokesperson said: Tonight is a chance to end months of speculation and allow the government to draw a line and move on, delivering on the people’s priorities. The PM welcomes the opportunity to make his case to MPs and will remind them that when they’re united and focused on the issues that matter to voters there is no more formidable political force. That final sentence is ambiguous. Is Johnson saying that there is no more formidable political force than himself, when the party is behind him, or no more formidable political force than a united Conservative party focused on the issues that matter? His problem is that, no matter what the outcome of the ballot is tonight, it will not show that the party is united. Brady will not say whether he has submitted a letter to himself calling a no-confidence vote, but he says it would be “slightly odd thing to do” given his position. And he says that, while technically it would be possible to change the rules, as they stand now if Boris Johnson wins there will be a year-long “period of grace” during which a further leadership contest cannot take place. Technically it’s possible for rules to be changed but the rule at present is there would be a period of grace. Sir Graham Brady is speaking to reporters now. He confirms what was in the statement he sent out earlier. He says the result will be announced “shortly” after the ballot closes at 8pm. Arrangements will be in place for Tory MPs needing proxy votes. He says he told Boris Johnson yesterday that the threshold had been reached. They agreed the vote should take place as soon as possible. He refuses to say how many letters he received. Asked when the threshold was reached, he says it is complicated, because some MPs said they only wanted their letter to be effective from the end of the platinum jubilee celebrations. Sir Graham Brady will have decided the timing for the no-confidence vote – between 6pm and 8pm tonight (see 8.12am) – after consultation with Boris Johnson. This is about as early as humanly possible – it had been reported that the vote was likely on Tuesday or Wednesday – and this reflects what happened in 2018, when the vote of no confidence in Theresa May was held 24 hours after Brady told May the threshold for a ballot had been reached. At the time that was seen as advantageous to her, because it gave her opponents less time to organise. No 10 probably made the same calculation in relation to the vote today. Sir Graham Brady has told Tory MPs that there will be a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, the BBC’s Chris Mason reports. It will take place this evening, between 6pm and 8pm. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been doing interviews on behalf of the government today. He told BBC Breakfast it was “likely” that there would be a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson. He said: My understanding probably isn’t much more than yours because you’ll probably know, or many of your viewers will know, that to have what’s called the vote of confidence requires at least 54 of my colleagues to write into Sir Graham Brady, to ask for one. Now, will that happen? I don’t know. That’s that’s a decision for my colleagues. I think it’s likely that something like that will happen. But it’s not something that I could tell you definitively. But it’s not what I think actually the country needs. I hope there isn’t – you have to be prepared but I think that what the country wants is for the government to get on and focus on the job at hand, which we are. Jesse Norman, the Tory MP and former Treasury minister, has announced that he has written to Sir Graham Brady calling for a no confidence vote in Boris Johnson. This brings the number of Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have submitted a letter calling for a no-confidence vote close to 30. But there are thought to be just as many MPs who have submitted letters who have done so in secret. Here is the Specatator’s tally from last week, and this was from Tom Larkin at Sky News. This is what Sir Graham Brady said last week when asked if he had already received 54 letters calling for a no-confidence vote. “I’ll retain my discretion,” he said. This was generally taken as being an elaborate way of saying “no comment”. But it might also have been a reference to the considerable flexibility (discretion) Brady has as chairman of the 1922 Committee to interpret the leadership contest rules. There are formal rules, but they are not published by the 1922 Committee, which leaves it up to the chairman to decide exactly how they are implemented. There has been speculation that the threshold of 54 letters was reached last week, but that Brady decided to hold off an announcement until today so as not to distract from the platinum jubilee celebrations. Good morning. After four days of tributes to the nation’s much-loved head of state, attention focuses to the head of government, Boris Johnson, who is held in rather lower esteem than the Queen - both at home and across the world - and who now seems almost certain to face a no-confidence vote of Tory MPs within the next day or two. A vote of no confidence has to take place when Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee, receives letters demanding one from 15% of Tory MPs (which at the moment means 54 of them). There are reports that Brady is set to announce that this threshold has been met within the hour. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand. And this is from Lucy Fisher from Times Radio. The Tory MP Sir Roger Gale told the Today programme a few minutes ago that Brady is “tight as a clam” and he has not yet confirmed that an announcement is coming. But broadcasters often tend to hear about these things first (they need to get cameras in place) and at Westminster the assumption is that a vote is now happening. The last time Brady announced a no-confidence vote in a PM (Theresa May), he did so in an announcement at 8am. Today I will almost exclusively be focusing on the Tory leadership crisis, but there are two events on the agenda worth noting. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 1.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on the cost of living. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

The French state-owned company said a new plant at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast would be cheaper because of replication in construction techniques, existing grid connections and the exploration of new finance models. In his first major public speech, Simone Rossi, EDF’s new chief executive, said Sizewell C could be significantly cheaper than Hinkley Point C and competitive with alternatives. The Italian executive said he was confident he could deliver Hinkley on time, with the first power to be generated by 2025. Other projects in France and Finland with the same reactor design have run years over schedule, and EDF had already warned that the Somerset plan could be 18 months late. Hinkley is the first nuclear power station to be built in the UK in a generation but was labelled “expensive and risky” by the government’s spending watchdog last year. One model the heavily indebted company is examining for a £16bn plant at Sizewell is the approach taken by Thames Water for London’s £4.2bn super-sewer, where the project is taken off the company’s balance sheet by creating a new company that other investors pour equity into. “With government, we started discussing and exploring this avenue that would make investment possible into a nuclear power station by third [party] investors, which would be a novelty,” said Rossi. Pension funds are among the potential investors EDF is hoping to court. Unlike a consortium seeking a public stake for a separate nuclear power plant at Wylfa in Wales, Rossi said government finance was not a prerequisite. Thrashing out the financing model for Sizewell was his top aim this year, Rossi told the Guardian. “For this year, our task, our deliverable, is a feasibility study [on financing].” The chief executive would not be drawn on whether he was sticking to the timetable of his predecessor, Vincent de Rivaz, of the Suffolk plant coming online in 2031. However, he said construction would start while Hinkley was still being built. Rossi was speaking near the Hinkley Point C site in Somerset, where building continues apace. Timber-clad buildings have sprung up to house 510 of the 3,000 workers now on-site, up from 1,800 a year ago. Huge concrete and steel tunnel casings lie around, ready to be deployed in the Bristol Channel for 11km of tunnels to take seawater for cooling. Rossi also used his speech to talk down the extent to which other technologies could provide the new low-carbon power the UK will need from the late 2020s. Energy efficiency was important but would not be enough to offset a growth in demand as other sectors such as cars turn to electricity, he said. Gas was useful but not green enough to meet the UK’s climate targets, he added. Wind and solar power were welcome but both were limited in the role they could play, Rossi claimed. He said Britain had “world class wind” and the recent reductions in windfarm subsidy costs were good news. On solar, he joked: “As an Italian, I know that Britain is not one of the sunniest places on the planet.” Large-scale battery storage, which EDF was working on in the UK, was useful but run flat in half an hour, he said. Despite the criticisms of competing technologies, he said Britain should install as much renewable energy as possible. “To summarise, the recipe is to use as much wind as you can, sprinkle some sun, some batteries, some gas around it, and put on a base of nuclear and put it in the oven,” he said.

The Dutch meteorological service, KNMI, said the temperature reached 39.2C (102.5F) at the Gilze-Rijen airbase near Breda on Wednesday afternoon, exceeding the previous high of 38.6C set in August 1944. In Belgium, the temperature in Kleine-Brogel hit 38.9C on Wednesday afternoon, fractionally higher than the previous record of 38.8C set in June 1947, and then subsequently rose to 39.9C. Forecasters said temperatures could climb further on Thursday. Germany’s national weather service, DWD, said it believed a new all-time national high of 40.5C – 0.2C higher than the record – had been set in the town of Geilenkirchen near the Dutch and Belgian borders, but had still to confirm it. “The most extreme heat will build from central and northern France into Belgium, the Netherlands and far western Germany into Thursday,” said Eric Leister of the forecasting group AccuWeather. After several cities in France broke previous temperature records on Tuesday, including Bordeaux, which hit 41.2C, the national weather service, Météo France, said Paris was likely to beat its all-time high of 40.4C, set in July 1947, with 42C on Thursday. City records in Amsterdam and Brussels are also expected to fall. Cities are particularly vulnerable in heatwaves because of a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, in which concrete buildings and asphalt roads absorb heat during the day and emit it again at night, preventing the city from cooling. The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C in the southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux. Clare Nullis, a World Meteorological Organization spokeswoman, said the heatwaves bore the “hallmark of climate change”. The extreme events were “becoming more frequent, they’re starting earlier, and they’re becoming more intense”, she said. “It’s not a problem that’s going to go away.” The 26-28 June heatwave in France was 4C hotter than a June heatwave would have been in 1900, according to World Weather Attribution, a new international programme helping the scientific community to analyse the possible influence of climate breakdown on extreme weather events. A study published earlier this year by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich said the summer heatwave across northern Europe last year would have been “statistically impossible” without climate change driven by human activity. KNMI has issued a code orange extreme temperature warning for all of the Netherlands except the offshore Wadden Islands and implemented its “national heat emergency” plan, while Belgium has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire country on a code red warning. Spain has also declared a red alert in the Zaragoza region, where the worst wildfires in 20 years took place last month. The EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service warned of an extreme danger of further forest fires in France and Spain on Thursday, with a high or very high threat level in Belgium, Germany, Italy and Portugal. Twenty French départements were also placed on red alert. Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, said: “Nobody is immune in the face of such extreme temperatures. There are risks even if you are not particularly vulnerable.” Britain’s Met Office issued similar advice and said the UK all-time high of 38.5C, recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003, could be exceeded on Thursday. Local authorities in France have placed restrictions on water usage in 73 of the country’s 96 départements following dramatic falls in ground and river water levels. “It’s tricky but under control, but we need to be very vigilant,” said the junior environment minister, Emmanuelle Wargon. The French energy company EDF said it was shutting down two reactors at its Golfech nuclear power plant in the southern Tarn-et-Garonne region in order to limit the heating of water used to keep the reactors cool. Scientists have said such heatwaves are closely linked to the climate emergency and will be many times more likely over the coming decades. Last month, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said Europe’s five hottest summers since 1500 had all occurred in the 21st century – in 2002, 2003, 2010, 2016 and 2018. Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, the institute said, adding that this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”. • This article was amended on 25 July 2019 to add a temperature announced after publication.

As international cooperation declined, and nationalist agendas gathered strength, China, the US, Russia and Europe, and their respective allies, emulators and proxies, engaged in often dangerous competition. The Chinese communist regime’s increasingly assertive behaviour at home and abroad, reflecting the authoritarian outlook of its paramount leader-for-life, Xi Jinping, produced head-on collisions with western countries, notably over Hong Kong, trade, technology and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. When the US and Britain objected to the abusive treatment of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, they were told to mind their own business. Sweeping opposition victories in local elections delivered a stern rebuke to Beijing, which it ignored. After six months of unrest, neither side seemed ready to back down. The unauthorised release to western media of hundreds of internal party documents exposed a ruthless government policy to indoctrinate up to 1 million Uighurs illegally held in concentration camp-like detention centres. China claimed to be fighting Islamist terrorism. Xi also attracted strong criticism over his signature Belt and Road global investment and infrastructure initiative, which Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, called a debt trap for the unwary. His alarm reflected fears over declining US leverage in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Europe. This decline was further illustrated by China’s mostly successful efforts to extend its sway in the South Pacific and the East and South China seas. “Freedom of navigation” patrols by western navies frayed tempers. Enhanced US diplomatic support and weapons sales to Taiwan, and Beijing’s reported covert efforts to subvert its “renegade province’s” presidential election next month, also fuelled tensions. In a defence white paper, China stressed its peaceful intentions but also its “combat readiness” and region-wide war-fighting capabilities. Before seeming to agree a trade deal in mid-December, Donald Trump escalated US-China rivalries on another front, imposing swingeing tariffs on imports and ostracising Huawei, the state-backed telecoms company. China retaliated in kind even as national economic growth slowed. The result was increased market volatility, bad blood and fears of another global economic crash. Trump’s confrontational and chaotic policies caused problems around the world. After prematurely boasting he had eliminated the North Korean nuclear threat, he failed to nail down a substantive agreement. The latter half of the year saw renewed weapons tests by Kim Jong-un’s regime, which set a 31 December deadline for progress. Chaos reigns in the Middle East In the Middle East, confusion reigned as Trump pushed Iran to the brink of war, then pulled back. With damaging US economic and financial sanctions, plus a global oil embargo still in place, and with Iran experiencing unprecedented levels of violent domestic political unrest, the potential for explosive conflict in 2020 was high. In north-east Syria, Trump dismayed European allies while delighting Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad by ordering the withdrawal of US troops. His decision gave the green light to a Turkish invasion that targeted the west’s Kurdish allies in the fight against Isis. In Idlib, the last populated province not under Assad’s control, hundreds of civilians and aid workers were killed by Russian and Syrian forces while hundreds of thousands were displaced. The lack of joined-up western policy in the Middle East, and clashing US-Europe interests, were on disastrous show in Israel, where Trump took a series of unilateral steps. The US recognised Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem and the captured Golan Heights, and claimed Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories were legal. Under Benjamin Netanyahu’s rightwing leadership, Israel mounted repeated military attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, maintained the blockade of Hamas-led Gaza, and aligned with autocratic, US-allied regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Instability deepened as Netanyahu failed to win successive elections and was charged with corruption. A third poll looms. The Syrian fiasco cast additional doubt on Nato’s cohesion. Turkey further defied its allies by buying a Russian missile system. Trump continued to denigrate the alliance and flounced out of a fractious summit in London after fellow leaders mocked him. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, who favours stronger EU defence, said Nato was “brain dead”. Russia meddles If the aim of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is to divide and weaken the western democracies, 2019 was a golden year. Russia’s Middle East leverage rose sharply, notably in Turkey, Syria and Libya. Collaboration with China expanded. Moscow’s disruptive hybrid warfare and online disinformation campaigns roiled Britain, eastern Europe and the Balkans. In the US, the Mueller report and the impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions in Ukraine exposed both Russia’s hidden hand and the skill with which Putin has outmanoeuvred US intelligence agencies, hoodwinked Republicans, and made a “useful idiot” out of Trump. The impeachment process starkly exposed divisions ahead of a 2020 presidential battle that promises to be uncommonly destructive. America’s neuroses seemed to radiate outwards. Trump’s attempts to stem the flow of migrants turned the US-Mexico border into an armed camp where shocking human rights abuses abounded. His closed door policy, plus US aid cuts, aggravated economic and security problems in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. South America erupts Further south, a ham-fisted US bid to unseat Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro nearly turned a crisis into a catastrophe. Bolivia’s long-serving leftwing president Evo Morales tried his hand at election-rigging and was ousted – an outcome that, for once, was not Trump’s fault. In Brazil, rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro became president in January and quickly established himself as a global bogeyman – principally over attempts to exploit the Amazon rainforest by burning it down. In Canada, prime minister Justin Trudeau was his own worst enemy, narrowly winning re-election despite the so-called blackface scandal. It proved another bad year for the rule of international law, multilateral cooperation, human rights and peace-making. The geopolitical paralysis of the UN security council over issues such as Syria, Israel-Palestine, Ukraine-Crimea, and Libya, usually pitting the US and Europe against China and Russia – and sometimes Europe against the US – mostly continued unchecked. Efforts to end the Yemen conflict achieved little. The same was true in Afghanistan, where it emerged that Nato and Afghan government forces were killing more civilians than the Taliban. Myanmar rejected claims in The Hague that it committed genocide against Rohingya Muslims. International treaties fared no better. Following his rejection last year of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, Trump formally reneged on the Paris climate accord. The US also quit the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and signalled it would not renew the New Start strategic nuclear arms treaty that expires in 2021. Trump announced $500bn in additional spending on nuclear weapons systems – thereby speeding up a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, which both updated or expanded their arsenals. The White House backed Saudi efforts to build nuclear power plants without the usual safeguards. Critics said this could open the way to Riyadh acquiring a nuclear bomb – and provoke other countries to follow suit. The weakening of the rules-based global order had extraterrestrial impact. Trump unveiled a revamped Space Command tasked with asserting US dominance in space – which he dubbed “the next war-fighting domain”. The move, ostensibly to defend intelligence satellites, ignored the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says space belongs to everyone. Terror strikes While the number of terrorist attacks in 2019 followed the downward trend of previous years, there were some horrific incidents. In New Zealand, an Australian white supremacist killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch. Weeks later, 257 people died in reportedly retaliatory Easter Day church attacks by Islamists in Sri Lanka. In London, two people died in the London Bridge attack in November. Despite recent defeats, Muslim jihadist organisations such as Isis, al-Qaida and Boko Haram were said to be regrouping. A sharp rise in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks by white nationalists and other bigots caused deep concern in the US, Britain and Europe. Elsewhere in the world, tensions in Indian-administered Kashmir reignited after Narendra Modi, India’s nationalist leader, imposed direct rule from Delhi. South Africa and Zimbabwe saw persistent unrest over economic hardship, misgovernance and human rights abuses. Old enemies Japan and South Korea spent much of the year arguing. In Lebanon, sectarian clashes raised a spectre of renewed civil war. France plunged into a “winter of discontent” over public-sector reforms. And in Britain, unresolved divisions over Brexit pushed national anxiety levels to new highs until Boris Johnson’s Conservatives triumphed in a brutally fought December election. Britain’s departure from the EU is now a certainty in 2020. Caught up in conflicts between states, many individuals paid a terrible personal price. Prominent among them was Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, whose unjust detention by Iran, now in its fourth year, was described by Amnesty International as “unspeakably cruel”. Like the uncounted victims of human rights abuses worldwide, Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family can only hope 2020 is kinder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/jul/01/iran-breaks-nuclear-deal-and-puts-pressure-on-eu-over-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-01T12:55:05Z","webTitle":"Iran breaks nuclear deal and puts pressure on EU over sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/iran-breaks-nuclear-deal-and-puts-pressure-on-eu-over-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/jul/01/iran-breaks-nuclear-deal-and-puts-pressure-on-eu-over-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Iran breaks nuclear deal and puts pressure on EU over sanctions","bodyText":"Iran has broken the terms of the nuclear deal for the first time since it was signed in 2015 in a move that will put pressure on Europe to do more to help mitigate the effect of crippling US sanctions. The breaching of the limits on uranium stockpiles, which Iran had warned of in advance, follows the US withdrawal from the deal last year and frustration in Tehran that EU states have been unable to do more to counterbalance the results of US sanctions. European leaders had urged Iran not to breach the terms of the deal. They will watch to see whether Tehran commits further breaches on 7 July, as it has threatened. Tehran revealed through the semi-official Fars press agency that it was breaching the deal by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to exceed 300kg (660lbs). Iran once had 10,000kg of higher-enriched uranium. Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, announced 10 days ago that Tehran intended to exceed the stockpile limit. But at a meeting in Vienna on Friday between Iran and the other signatories to the 2015 deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), the EU made new offers to persuade Tehran not to go ahead with its threat. At the meeting, the EU announced that a long-planned trading mechanism with Iran, Instex, had finally been established and the first transactions completed. Iranian and the EU representatives are likely to meet again before 7 July in what will probably be decisive talks in a period of diplomatic brinkmanship. Iran has threatened to increase the level at which it enriches uranium above the 3.7% limit in the deal, which is enough to fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Uranium needs to be enriched to about 90% to become weapons grade. However, once a country enriches uranium to about 20%, scientists say, the time needed to reach 90% is halved. Iran has previously enriched to 20%. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he was deeply worried by Iran’s announcement that it had broken its nuclear deal obligations, but he did not put forward any unilateral steps in response. “The UK remains committed to making the deal work and using all diplomatic tools to de-escalate regional tensions,” he said. “I urge Iran to avoid any further steps away from JCPoA and come back into compliance.” The UK, France and Germany are expected to issue a formal response. The three have the option of referring Iran’s decision to an appeals body set up by the signatories to the deal, which could take up to two months to examine the dispute before Europe could reimpose sanctions that were lifted in 2015. But the Iran deal is not an international treaty with the force of law, so either side could take unilateral steps without direct legal consequence. Tehran is convinced that with political will, Europe could do more to increase trade with Iran, which has collapsed over the past year. The wave of US secondary sanctions has deterred almost all large European businesses, including banks, from trading with Iran. On Friday Tehran said some of the steps announced by France, Germany and the UK were positive but not sufficient to deter it from breaking the deal. Before the Vienna meeting, seven other European states said they would join Instex. Tehran has been pressing Europe to also use the trading mechanism to establish credit lines so that Iranian oil exports to Europe can be financed through it. Instex is confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods not subject to US sanctions, such as food and medicine. China has given an undertaking that it will continue to buy oil from Tehran. Iranian oil exports have fallen to about 400,000 barrels a day, harming public finances. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif vowed Iran would never give in to US pressure. “If they want to talk to Iran, they should show respect. Never threaten an Iranian … Iran has always resisted pressure and has responded with respect when respected,” he said in a speech broadcast live on TV. Zarif said Instex could counter what he regarded as the weaponisation of the dollar in an attempt to impose US foreign policy on Europe. He said Instex did not meet Iran’s demands or Europe’s obligations, but still had a “strategic value” in showing Washington’s closest allies were “distancing themselves from America in their economic relations”. He added: “This will certainly have long-term effects.” Zarif claimed Russia and China had recently decided to stop trading with dollars as part of a global trend away from using the currency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/10/protesters-disrupt-us-panels-fossil-fuels-pitch-at-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-10T16:21:27Z","webTitle":"Protesters disrupt US panel's fossil fuels pitch at climate talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/protesters-disrupt-us-panels-fossil-fuels-pitch-at-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/dec/10/protesters-disrupt-us-panels-fossil-fuels-pitch-at-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"Protesters disrupt US panel's fossil fuels pitch at climate talks","bodyText":"A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of “Shame on you”. Monday’s protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation, which used its only public appearance to promote the “unapologetic utilisation” of coal, oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump’s adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on “conservative clean energy”. The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia’s coal-enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of “innovation and entrepreneurship” in the technological development of nuclear power, “clean coal” and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffith’s opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of “It’s not funny”, and then a series of chants of “Keep it in the ground” and “Shame on you”. Several campaigners read statements. “There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now,” said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: “In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible”. This statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump’s proposal to replace the Clean Power Act. “It’s ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that,” said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.” Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and was producing more petroleum than ever. “To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically,” he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world’s scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against “alarmism” that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. “They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow’s coal technology to improve energy security,” he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. “Trump is playing politics, but it’s not changing the facts on the ground,” he said. “Coal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we’ll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy.” An alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the “We’re still in” group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. “I was completely embarrassed to be an American”, said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. “Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong.

If you haven’t been one of the millions to fill out your census already, tonight is the night. Here’s what made the news today: There were over 234,000 doses of vaccine administered across the country on Monday, bringing the total number of doses to just short of 14m. There were 379 local cases of Covid-19 reported across the country, with a record 356 in NSW, 20 in Victoria, and three in Queensland. At least 97 of those in NSW were in the community while infectious, and 15 of the 20 in Victoria were in the community while infectious. All three in Queensland were in quarantine while infectious. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said her government has considered further measures to limit movement and interaction but would not introduce harsher restrictions unless they have a proven impact on virus transmission. Victoria has not said whether the lockdown will be extended beyond Thursday, with the health minister, Martin Foley stating decisions were being made on an “hour-by-hour basis” and that he couldn’t tell what the future would bring. Residents of Cairns and the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah will be released from a three-day lockdown on Wednesday if there’s no sign of further infections. Prime minister Scott Morrison is under pressure to discipline Queensland LNP MP George Christensen after he promoted conspiracy theories in parliament that lockdowns and face masks do not work. Morrison has said he wants the country to beat Delta so families can get together by Christmas. Take care this evening, and we will be back tomorrow with all the latest on the Covid situation in Australia and the parliamentary sitting week. The former prime ministers Malcom Turnbull and Kevin Rudd are addressing a La Trobe Asia webinar focused on Australia’s relationship with China. The discussion has turned to climate action, a day after the IPCC report on the threat the climate emergency poses. Turnbull says China needs to act on climate - but he adds: The proposition that we should all down tools until China does more is very naive. Turnbull says a wealthy developed country like Australia should be at the forefront of climate action: We’re not. So that’s a huge, huge problem. This story is horrific. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also flagged in a release that just arrived that legislation has passed parliament today allowing companies to continue to hold virtual meetings and use electronic communications until the end of March 2022. The government plans now to work on legislation to be introduced into parliament later this year to make some of these measures permanent. Here is LNP MP George Christensen’s speech to parliament earlier on Covid-19 lockdowns and mask use, including the introduction from Labor leader Anthony Albanese where he refers to what Christensen is saying as misinformation. There’s a bit happening in the Senate. Nationals backbench senators have just announced they will seek to amend Australia’s Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to bring an end to the prohibition on nuclear energy. The government also voted against the following urgent Greens motion at 4pm: “The world is rapidly warming and, unless emergency action is taken, could reach 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures within the next decade, putting Australians at risk of more frequent and more intense heatwaves, fires, droughts and floods.” And the second part of AAP’s report on the NSW Covid inquiry: Greens MP Cate Faehrmann asked why premier Gladys Berejiklian had announced the state could ease restrictions after 50% of people were vaccinated, contrary to advice from the Doherty institute. Faehrmann: The Doherty institute modelling shows 50%, 60%, or even 70% levels of vaccine coverage would not allow for relaxed restrictions unless we’re prepared for a massive uptake in hospital admissions and death. Professor Doherty himself said if we open up at 50% that would be insane. But health minister Brad Hazzard said the premier was trying to give the community a sense of hope and drive up vaccination rates, and they were taking advice and would need to know more before easing public health orders. The health minister disputed suggestions the government had not listened to the health advice regarding the “moving feast” that was the Covid-19 Delta strain outbreak. He repeatedly reminded the committee the pair had volunteered their time and were not obliged to answer any questions. “It would be the first time in history that in the middle of a war, a parliamentary committee called an inquiry to ask us how did you make your decisions,” he said. Shoebridge said the NSW government was less transparent than Victoria’s after premier Daniel Andrews was available “for the better part of a day” to answer questions. AAP reports the NSW government was not aware of the extent of the Covid-19 outbreak stemming from a “super spreader” party in western Sydney when it waited 10 days to lock down parts of the state, a parliamentary inquiry has been told. Chief health officer Kerry Chant and health minister Brad Hazzard were quizzed about their handling of the recent Covid outbreak at an inquiry on Tuesday. Chant: It was the seeding event in western Sydney ... West Hoxton that wasn’t recognised at the time. It was thought that cluster had been identified very early but there were issues around containment of that, that weren’t appreciated. Obviously with the benefit of hindsight, there are different decisions that can be made. Just over 30 people attended the West Hoxton birthday party dubbed a “super spreader” event in late June, before the eastern suburbs were subsequently locked down days later. Greens MP David Shoebridge asked why this was the case. Chant: The initial intelligence was the West Hoxton party was effectively controlled, everyone immediately contacted within the timeframe. There were subsequent emerging issues associated with that and I’d be happy to reflect on the thinking at that particular time. Here’s a flashback. The PM talking about Coalition climate policy in 2019. “In a canter” gets a run. The wonderful Josh Taylor will take you through the evening – a very big thank you to everyone who joined with us today, as we juggled Covid and parliament. It’s a huge amount of information to take in and I know it’s made more difficult when you are in lockdown, or just frustrated/worried/anxious for answers about what is happening in your community, and it is not something we take lightly. Seven weeks in lockdown, without a clear sight to the end, is mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting and to everyone who is going through it right now – or just battling with this year in general – we understand and we are thinking of you. If there was any way to get the information to you quicker, we would do it – thank you for checking back, and thank you for your comments and questions. We do read them, and we do take them on board. And right now, whatever you need to do to get through is the right thing. It’s hard. And it can’t be easy being in that position and listening to some of the things we hear our leaders say. We get that too. Remember you are not alone, and if it helps to scream, do that too. Mike Bowers will be back with us tomorrow, as will your Canberra team of Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp. I’ll be with you from early tomorrow morning. In the meantime, please – take care of you. Greens senator Larissa Waters has seen a motion pass in the Senate which calls on the government to release documents relating to the awarding of a $21m grant to the fracking company Empire Energy The order compels the government to produce by 9.30am on Thursday 12 August, all correspondence, lists of applicants and grant guidelines related to its Beetaloo Basin grant scheme, in addition to details of any meetings between Ministers Angus Taylor or Keith Pitt and Empire Energy. In case you missed it earlier today (it was during the press conference deluge) Greens senator Rachel Siewert officially announced her retirement: Matt Kean, the NSW Liberal environment minister also had some things to say about his federal Coalition colleague: Paul Fletcher may want to indulge the wacko views of George Christensen on this and any other topic but I am certainly not going to. I think that he is as qualified to talk about health policy as he is to perform brain surgery and I think George Christensen would do us all a favour by being a team player, supporting the prime minister and making sure that we can all get out of this crisis on the other side. ... People are entitled to their opinions. They are just not entitled to their own facts. And George is making up his own fact here. What we know is that we need to listen to the science, we need to take the expert advice and put in place policy based on that. We should not just do it when it comes to dealing with Covid-19, we should do it when it comes with dealing with climate change as well and that is what I am arguing on both fronts. ... I think we should call our people who are spreading misinformation and falsehoods in the public square at any time, regardless of what team they play for. I am always respectful of people having a different opinion but I am not very respectful of people putting out this information and making up their own facts. We should call it out, whether it be in regards to Covid-19 or whether it be in regard to climate science. That is what I am doing here today. Warren Entsch, another LNP MP, has called out George Christensen (something Paul Fletcher, a cabinet minister, didn’t manage to do, despite being asked five times). Here is Entsch on the ABC: I have to say I was absolutely appalled by his contribution. I think it was totally inappropriate. That is the sort of nonsense that I see in protests outside my office from time to time for those with conspiracy theories but I think it is reasonable to say that it was raised in the parliament today, I think it was resoundingly rejected right across the whole political spectrum when the motion was put up it was supported, there was not a single dissenter. People are entitled to have a view but I think as an elected member you need to be a little more, if you like, careful with the views that you express. It is very, very unhelpful and totally inappropriate in dealing with the situation we are in at the moment and I am glad to see that there is that unity across the political spectrum today when those views were soundly rejected. Why is the Coalition so scared of pulling George Christensen into line? There are two issues at play. One is linked to Christensen himself – the government doesn’t have enough of a buffer in the House any longer to allow it to lose any more MPs, after Craig Kelly moved to the crossbench. Here’s how Craig Kelly is going, by the way: (He is apparently using his time in lockdown to set up timers to take sad photos of himself, and tweet, given his feed.) But back to Christensen – so yes, it would be a problem if he decided to quit. Which he could – he’s threatened it previously, and has nothing to lose. The other issue, is the Coalition, under John Howard, spent a lot of time courting One Nation voters, who remain in the party, in small but noisy numbers. They help make up a lot of the “base” we hear so much about. And the problem with that is, Christensen (and Kelly) and Matt Canavan and Gerard Rennick speak to those people, and keep them in the tent. So if you are the Coalition, which is only governing with a tiny majority, in a nation which has spent much of the last six years on a 49.5% to 50.5% split in the vote, you can’t afford to see those people get huffy and take their vote elsewhere, by criticising the people in your party that you are listening to. It’s the same problem the Coalition has on climate. So that’s the short answer – the Coalition can’t afford to lose any more numbers in the House, and it has to try and keep a small cohort of its base happy. Ain’t party politics grand? So just a short time after the House condemned comments like the ones George Christensen has made (in a debate where the prime minister couldn’t even say Christensen’s name) Paul Fletcher can’t bring himself to say he disagrees with his colleague on the misleading, false, outright wrong, and dangerous comments he makes in relation to the health response to Covid. Yup. The non-answers continue: Q: Hallelujah to science because it is the only thing that is going to get us out of this situation. Science is the answer. George Christensen is not relying on science. If you look at his statements. When Craig Kelly was making statements that the government deemed offensive he was dressed down and now sits on the crossbench. Should the same thing happen to George Christensen? Paul Fletcher: Again, Patricia, you can engage in all kinds of questions about particular scenarios, what we are focused on is a cabinet and what the prime minister, health minister and government are focused on is dealing with this health crisis and the associated economic difficulties, saving lives, saving livelihoods. We will get on without a lever to others ... Q: But it is not up to others because you are cabinet ministers ... you are important person in the government, a compliment from me. You have a key role in the government. A cabinet minister in the Morrison government. Here you have someone on the government benches in the Nationals but in the Coalition, saying stuff that I am assuming would be alarming to you. Given it is not based on science fact. So given that, why not denounce him? Why not treat him in the same way that Craig Kelly was treated? Fletcher: Well, Patricia, you can keep inviting me to issue denunciations or condemnations but I will stay focused as with the prime minister, as well cabinet, as will government on the challenges in front of us in dealing with those in a calm, methodical way. Q: Yes, but the misinformation about the vaccine, masks, is contributing to some of this bad behaviour we are seeing around the country is it not? Fletcher: Well, what we’re seeing now is significant increases in vaccine take-up numbers. Of course that reflects both the demand and supply side. We have seen, pleasingly I think, Australians around the country coming forward to get vaccinated up I know in my own electorate for example, I am in contact with GPs who are administering vaccines such as the Roseville respiratory clinic, the doctor leading that outstanding work just a couple of days ago said that there was strong demand and they are increasing the amounts of AstraZeneca. And there has been I think a very strong response from the Australian people, people have identified the challenge that we collectively face and people are coming forward, behaving responsibly in terms of their own health but also in the best outcome for the community. And if you are vaccinated, you are not only greatly improve your own chances of not falling hill and being hospitalised, what you also do is improve overall outcomes for community. Paul Fletcher meanwhile, has been asked five or so times whether he disagrees with George Christensen’s statements on Afternoon Briefing, and won’t answer. Q: Your Coalition colleague George Christensen has called to an end to Covid-19 restrictions. He used a speech to parliament earlier today to describe restrictions as madness arguing masks and lockdowns don’t work. Darren Chester a colleague of his in the party tweeted he doesn’t agree with the minister’s views. What do you think? Fletcher: I think our government led by Prime Minister Morrison and Health Minister Hunt and the National Security Committee has a very clear plan and focus in relation to dealing with Covid. That includes of course, working with state governments, supporting them through lockdowns as they judged appropriate to administer them or to introduce them, providing support through the ADF map and providing very substantial funding support for the Covid disaster payments and business payments in both New South Wales and Victoria. And of course our relentless focus on the vaccine with another 234,000 vaccinated in the last 24 hours, numbers continuing to build ... Q: That is your focus. Do you denounce what George Christensen has said? Fletcher: Look, what we are interested in is focusing on the issues ... Q: You might be interested in that but with respect minister, if you don’t call out misinformation – is he wrong? Fletcher: The government’s position is very clear. In relation to the efficacy of vaccines, it is based on the science. Is George Christensen statement wrong? The government’s position is clear ... Q: That is not what I am asking you. I am asking about his statements. Fletcher: You can ask me whatever you want but the answer I am going to give you is that as a cabinet ministers in the Morrison government, focused on dealing with the largest health crisis are nation has faced for a hundred years, we are focused on taking the scientific advice and implementing measures in response to that. Darren Chester, who was dumped from the ministry by Barnaby Joyce, seems to have run out of [patience, what iPhone corrects to ducks you choose]. The Greens have introduced a bill to the Senate in an attempt to force the Morrison government to explain why it has not imposed any additional sanctions in response to the military coup in Myanmar. The bill – proposed by the Victorian senator Janet Rice – would also require the minister to respond to referrals from parliament. The move comes nearly a week after the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, announced the government would amend Australia’s existing autonomous sanctions laws to make it easier to impose sanctions for gross human rights abuses or serious corruption. That followed a cross-party parliamentary committee report back in December that called for a standalone Magnitsky-style act for targeted sanctions, like the one in place in the US. In a speech tabled in the Senate, Rice said the Greens were “very conscious of the extensive evidence the committee received about the shortfalls in the current [sanctions] regime”. “We agree with many of those critiques – we would prefer to see a full Magnitsky act that is framed to target human rights abuses. However, while we are waiting for the Australian government to act, tragically, human rights abuses are continuing to occur in countries around the world, and the Australian government has tools available in the current sanctions framework which it is not using.” Rice said the bill would create a referral framework “so that where a number of parliamentary bodies ... pass a resolution in relation to a particular human rights abuser or a person responsible for serious corruption, then the minister will be required to provide a statement” explaining whether or not the government will act. The decision would still rest, however, with the foreign minister. The bill also “explicitly includes a clause requiring an urgent statement from the foreign minister, as to whether the Australian government will impose targeted sanctions against individuals who have been responsible for, or complicit in, the coup in Myanmar”. The private senator’s bill will be debated at a later date. Meanwhile, the point of Scott Morrison’s “it’s not how you start the race, but how you finish it” comments (now that he has acknowledged that it is actually a race) is part of the rebranding he has been doing since he came out of quarantine – he wants you to remember that Australia had a good response to the pandemic – and that’s all he want you to remember. His whole focus is on scrubbing any reference to anything which has happened this year, until now, that the vaccine program is actually moving. That’s it. He just wants people to remember Australia’s original pandemic response (forgetting that it was mostly led by the states which dragged the commonwealth to decisions like closing the border, locking down, and financial supports) and then remember the end of the year, where the vaccination targets are hopefully met. So now, it will all be about the end of the race. Expect a lot more sporting analogies, a lot more focus on the finish line, and a lot more scrubbing over very, very recent history. For the record, here is what Scott Morrison said on 7 April 7 2019, when he accused Bill Shorten of wanting to end your weekend, with an electric car policy. Q: Prime minister on electric vehicles you mentioned, the Government is funding rapid recharge stations through the $6 million ARENA initiative. Morrison: Yeah, we are. Q: Angus Taylor says they could charge a car in 15 minutes? Morrison: That’s new technology, not existing technology. Q: Do you believe him or do you believe, er, how is what he said with 15 minutes different from what Bill Shorten said? Morrison: Yeah I’ve heard Labor pushing this around today. There’s two things. First, we don’t have a problem with electric vehicles, in fact, we’ve been facilitating the development of the infrastructure and the new technologies. What Angus Taylor was talking about was technologies that at present are not in general use. What Bill Shorten was talking about is how long it actually takes to charge up a vehicle today. He clearly had no idea. I mean, go online, you can go and find those little cars that kids drive around in, even they take eight or nine hours to charge overnight. So look, the point about it is not whether electric vehicles are good or bad, in fact, they have a role to play increasingly in the vehicle fleet of Australia over the next decade. The problem here is for Bill Shorten, who doesn’t understand his own policy. But in typical Labor fashion, they want to ram it down the necks of all Australians. So the cheapest car you can currently buy as an electric vehicle presently, my understanding is that including all on-road costs and all the rest of it, it’s about $45,000 to $50,000. That’s the cheapest car Bill Shorten wants to make available for you to buy in the future. I’ll tell you what; it’s not going to tow your trailer. It’s not going to tow your boat. It’s not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family. Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend, when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles, where you’ve got Australians who love being out there in their four wheel drives. He wants to say ‘see ya later’ to the SUV when it comes to the choices of Australians. This is fundamentally the difference between us and Labor when it comes to these issues. We have no problem with the adoption of these new technologies and we facilitate it and we’re part of it. But what Bill Shorten wants to do, without seemingly even understanding what his policy does, is trying to drive people into these decisions. His policies simply don’t have the backing and how he’ll can’t explain how he will achieve these targets. I’ll give you an example. He still has not explained what would be the impact on petrol and diesel excise revenue over the next decade? I mean the net take out of the excise is about $11bn a year. So Bill, what’s the bill? Scott Morrison ends question time. He also gives a personal explanation. Morrison has always been for electric vehicles. As they would apparently say in the Shire “how good are electric vehicles”. Thankfully, question time was extended, because if it wasn’t, we would have missed the member for Stirling discover the word “fundamental” which he pronounces like he has just been handed a word to stuff in his mouth and is offering it back to the parliament like a mama bird, regurgitating five-day-old bread to hungry baby chicks. Peta Murphy asks Scott Morrison whether Australians who had their car parks scrapped before they were started were “winners” (Morrison said Australians were the winners in the car park funding program the auditor general has absolutely torn apart). Paul Fletcher takes it and says Labor’s position is “mystifyingly schizophrenic” (which is offensive – let’s not use mental health diagnoses to make political points) because he can’t understand how Labor is against the car park funding program, but for car parks. It’s simple, minister. The auditor general has problems with this particular funding program for these particular car parks and how they were chosen, and there were questions raised in that report, highlighting some of the problems, including the cost, and the list of marginal electorates which were included in the decision making process. No one is against car parks. That’s not something anyone is suggesting and frankly, it’s a juvenile attempt at false equivalence. Given the amount of information in the climate space, Adam Morton and Katharine Murphy have completed a fact check on some of what was said today. It’s a lot – but it is worth it. These things have to be called out. The Senate has agreed to a Greens push to refer the $4.8bn urban congestion fund, which includes the $660m commuter car park fund, to a parliamentary inquiry. The issue will now be examined by the finance and public administration references committee. The inquiry will consider whether the fund “meets the highest standards of governance, performance and accountability in the expenditure of public funds”. The inquiry will also consider “the role of the offices of the minister(s), the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and any external parties, in determining which projects to allocate funding and who would announce these projects”. We were eager to see if One Nation would support this push, because it’s usually their votes that are required – but in the end the government did not call a division, so the numbers weren’t tested. Question time resumes with a dixer. Mike Freelander finishes and the motion is passed on the voices – no dissent. Mike Freelander: I think it is no longer acceptable to ignore the absolutely disgraceful comments from the member for Dawson, things like ‘wearing mask must make no significant difference, the spread of Covid-19 lockdowns don’t work, lock downs don’t destroy the virus but they destroy people’s lives livelihoods’. Imagine if you’re locked down in Sydney, and you’re a tradesman, or manual worker and you’re hearing this message from a member of parliament. Imagine what that does to your confidence in the advice, the medical advice you’re being given. Now just think about that. All of us in this place, have a responsibility to keep people safe. What we do does actually matter. We’re not there in intensive care, sucking the secretions, out, out of people who have a tube down their throat, breathing, with the use of a respirator, were not able to visit a grieving mother or father, who is terminally ill with Covid 19, but we can make a difference, and we can make a difference by calling out people who actively seek to undermine error spots. I’m so grateful for the leader of the opposition moving this motion. It’s one that everyone in this house should support. And I think it is time that we did all work together and condemn these people, condemn members of our parliament that are undermining our response to this great health crisis, condemn those in the media who are doing the same thing. We’re undermining our response. We all have to do that. If we all do it together, that’s what will make a difference. Labor’s Mike Freelander seconds the motion and speaks, saying as a doctor, it is very personal for him. He says like Voldemort, Scott Morrison couldn’t even name George Christensen. Freelander also names Matt Canavan and Gerard Rennick as government MPs who have spoken against health measures, as well as Craig Kelly (a former government member). Freelander: Many in my electorate cannot see how they’re going to pay the next mortgage repayment. They can’t see how they can protect their own kids, they can’t see their kids even going back to school. And yet we have people on the government benches, actively undermining our response. Now, I don’t like to see healthcare workers as heroes. And I’m sure that the member for Higgins can understand – what they do is they get up every day and they go to work, some of them putting their lives at risk, because that’s the job they do because they care about people, and they want to make sure that our response is the best that it possibly can be. And that’s just the job they sign up for, the nurses, the doctors, the cleaners, the pathology technicians. They’re the people that save lives. I don’t save lives sitting here as a member of parliament and that is something I recognise. That is a huge privilege. And with that privilege comes a huge responsibility. And when I see people on any side of politics [actively undermining] our response to this crisis, this health crisis, just makes me angry, they should not be ignored. They should be called out on every occasion. Because what they are doing is disgraceful. And I think any sensible person would understand that the time has to come when they should be called out. Then Scott Morrison says it is a race. Sort of. Morrison: It doesn’t matter how you start the race, it is how you finish the race. It is how you finish the race. There were guffaws in the chamber. Morrison continues: We are going to finish this race and we are going to race all the way to the finish line but we are going to do it as Team Australia, not in a way which seeks to divide Australians and set Australians against each other. We are not going to do it in a way that seeks to demonise people in this country, we will listen carefully to the people of Australia, we will listen carefully to their anxieties and concerns and we will work with them. Our vaccine is free. Our vaccine is not mandatory. It is necessary that during the suppression phase we have the lockdowns and we have the restrictions. And they are necessary for the public health of this nation. Mr Speaker, my government will continue to focus on the job at hand. My government will continue to focus on the public health of Australians, it will continue to focus on working together with Australians, not to set them apart from another ... my government will focus on the results that Australians want to achieve. ... My government will remain focused on the public health, the lives and livelihoods of Australians as we continue to roll vaccine, Mr Speaker, we will have, by the end of this year, we will be able to say that we have saved the lives of over 30,000 Australians, we have put a million people back into work and we have vaccinated the country, Mr Speaker, and we are achieving the that we have set. Mr Speaker, that is what Australians are focused on. They are interested in their jobs, their health, their futures, not interested in the politics of Covid-19. In the phoney debates, what they are interested in is the results of Australian lives and livelihoods being saved. That’s what we are focused on. That’s what we will focus on every single day. In the last three minutes of his allotted time, Scott Morrison gets to George Christensen – but without naming him, or referencing him: Australians have been carrying Australians through the crisis. And they have had the great support of their governments at unprecedented levels and working each and every day as a team of Australians to get this as right as we possibly can. One of the key things we have done throughout this as we have been informed by the best possible medical advice, by the best advisers in the world, whether it be the Theraputic Goods Administration, the chief medical officer, the expert medical panel. All of these organisations informing us. These groups have been meeting almost on a daily basis for 18 months, and my government and the governments led around this country has listened carefully and taken that advice, and acted accordingly, and Australia together has saved lives and livelihoods. That is what we have done, and that is why my government doesn’t support misinformation in any shape or form. We do not, Mr Speaker, that is not the position of a government, my government will not support those statements where there is misinformation that is out and about in the community, whether it posted on Facebook, social media, written in articles or make statements. Or anywhere else. What I am not going to do, Mr Speaker, is not engage in a partisan debate on this. I am not, because what I know is Australians aren’t interested in the politics of Covid, they are not interested in the noise of Covid, they are not interested in the shouting of Covid. What they are interested in is that we make our Australian way through this crisis, and I tell you what – our Australian way through this crisis has stood tall and the world. Australians and this crisis have stood tall, whether it is Bill Gates or whether it is others who have looked at what has happened around the world and they said Australia has stood out. We haven’t got everything right, but where we haven’t we have applied ourselves to address those problems, fix those problems and get it right. Scott Morrison is now speaking on the motion, speaking on what the government has done: On January 20 2020, the national incident room [for] Covid-19 was activated by the government. It wasn’t until March 12 that the World Health Organisation declared a Covid-19 pandemic but by that time Australia had already called it, Australia had already done its response, Australia had already closed its borders. Mr Speaker, it was only the day after that that the governments of Australia, the states and territories, came together. I remember the day very, very well. As we were updated during the course of that meeting of the rapid escalation in cases that had been unanticipated I recall at the commencement of that meeting that Brendan Murphy, the then chief health officer, had already reported to ministers and those in attendance. The governor of the Reserve Bank was that the day to talk about the potential economic consequences. The head of the national coordinating mechanism that had been set up at the Department of Home Affairs to ensure integration between business, industry and governments in response to the pandemic, and that day we agreed the federation would have to operate in a very different way than it has been done throughout history. Since then, we have come together as Australians of different political persuasions of governments – small and large – to work together to manage our response to the COVID-19 pendant. On 50 occasions we have met in good faith and in a good sense to take the steps necessary to protect Australian lives and livelihoods. It is true, Mr Speaker, over that time, no government has got everything right, whether here in Australia or anywhere else around the world, but I remember those fears at that time very vividly. I remember the fears of what this could do to our most vulnerable communities, and I particularly recall discussing this with the minister for Indigenous Australians, the community we feared for the most was Indigenous Australians, the impact that would have. Anthony Albanese: The member for Dawson said, ‘it is just like the flu, we will have to live with it, not the constant fear of it’. Well, I have got to say this. I am scared and Australians are scared of Covid. There is fear because they are fearful of something that is scary. This is having an impact. People are dying. People are dying, people are getting sick. There are almost 30 people in hospital today on ventilators, being kept alive by a machine. There are almost around double that in hospital, in an ICU. This is a scary disease that requires an appropriate response. The parliament needs to disassociate itself from the member for Dawson’s comments that was let go for far too long with mad theories of what drugs people should do. We didn’t have what we had in the United States – drinking bleach and various things – but we have had quite inappropriate theories promoted by the member for Dawson, and that is why this should be supported. Looks like Anthony Albanese has just found his groove in this speech: I will tell you what madness is. Madness is saying – let this disease rip. Let people die. Let whole economies be shut down. Let’s stop us being able to return to our way of life. That is what is madness. The madness of conspiracy theorists. The madness and the replacement of the former Deputy Prime Minister as its leader as a result of being prepared – think of this [member] wagging the National party dog because the former deputy prime minister wouldn’t have a bar of this sort of nonsense, but the current one is quite happy to give it the [tick]. The Liberal National Party is are quite happy to give a voice to the member for Dawson. He is not sitting on the crossbench. I will tell you why – we will take you seriously – we will take the government seriously when the member for Dawson is expelled from the party and is sitting over there with the member for Hughes, because the member for Hughes has also sprouted these sort of conspiracy theories day after day, week after week, month after month at a time when our heroes – our heroes of the pandemic are doing great work each and every day, being undermined by someone paid for by the taxpayer with the great honour of sitting and this house over representatives. But, with that great honour of sitting in the House of Representatives comes obligation – an obligation to be fair dinkum, an obligation to promote truth, an obligation not to promote conspiracy theories. An obligation to listen to the health professionals. And the health professionals have had a difficult task. Anthony Albanese doesn’t seem prepared for this speech – not surprising, given almost all of Labor’s motion to suspend standing orders are rejected. So we are getting a speech off the cuff, which he seems to be making up as he goes along. So you are seeing unadulterated, un-scripted Albanese. This motion to suspend standing orders was written in response to George Christensen’s 90-second statement before question time (it doesn’t seem to have been planned before hand) This parliament applauds the sacrifice made by the Australian people to keep each other safe. The parliament thinks the heroes of the pandemic, our scientists, doctors, nurses, aged care and disability workers, cleaners and other essential workers. This house condemns the comments of the member for Dawson prior to question time designed to use our national parliament to spread misinformation and undermine the actions of Australians to defeat Covid. The house rejects statements that masks do not work, that lockdowns do not work and the describing of our health professionals as, quote, dictatorial medical bureaucrats. The house calls on all members to refrain from making ill-informed comments at a time when the pandemic represents a serious threat to the health of Australians. Scott Morrison goes and has a chat to the leader of the house – and leave is granted. Can’t really deny debate on this one. Catherine King to David Littleproud: My question is to the minister representing the minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development. Does the minister support the creation of electronic vaccination certificates which passengers will need to fly within Australia and overseas? This is in relation to what Qantas wants – basically a no vax no take off. The government tries to argue its a question for the health minister, but Labor says it is about aviation, so Littleproud has to take it: Thank you and I thank the member for her question. As I would hope not only the member and those opposite would appreciate the deputy prime minister is unable to attend and was in fact planning to be here this week but could not because of Covid and, obviously, we’re working through arrangements and I act on his behalf and I am prepared to take that on and work with other relevant agencies such as health and the attorney general, workplace minister, to make sure that there is a proper answer. But if those opposite were serious about this they would have made sure that they forward that to the appropriate minister. Karen Andrews seems absolutely shocked that protesters may not follow the rules. Worth noting that there is a dixer and parliamentary time being taken up by the government on some spray paint outside parliament house and the Lodge, but there has been all but radio silence on the thousands of people who broke lockdown rules to protest anti-vaccination and restrictions. That was “freedom of speech” according to the prime minister. Here is Andrews, using her disappointed face, talking about this morning’s Extinction Rebellion protest: The incidence this morning that were conducted outside this place were not conducted in the usual peaceful way that we are accustomed to seeing events taking place outside this place. They were not registered and they were not expected. Frankly, they weren’t protests, so let’s call it what it is. It was premeditated vandalism and property damage. The Australian federal police responded very quickly* to both of these incidents and eight people have been arrested. Three offenders were put under arrest at the Lodge and AFP officers arrested a further five offenders at Parliament House. Once again, the AFP has been at the front line and I thank them for their ongoing dedication to keeping our community here safe. I join with the prime minister and other members of this place in saying that this sort of violent**, damaging protest has no place in Australian political debate. I think Australians will be very shocked by the scenes they will see replayed out the front and in our national capital today because they know that this is not how we get a point across in Australia. We all condemn this sort of wilful, planned behaviour which, frankly, endangers protesters, public and law enforcement officers alike. This is not the Australian way***. I would also like to make the point, I did when my own office was vandalised about a month ago, damage to public property is not a minor matter. It ends up costing every single taxpayer. It’s stupid, it’s unnecessary and it’s against the law. I say to these people that when you damage public property, you do even more damage to your own cause. The right to protest is a fundamental right in our society and we all respect peaceful protests that are conducted safely and lawfully. But our government will not be swayed by attempts to intimidate, through violence or destruction, and our law enforcement agencies will respond swiftly and decisively as they have today to incidents of this nature. *The protesters had time to spray paint two giant sentences on the parliament, glue themselves to the forecourt and set a pram on fire. Then go to the Lodge and spray “Duty of Care” before they were arrested **The protests were not violent. ***Australia is literally a nation colonised to act as penal colony. Angus Taylor takes another dixer so he can say “technology not taxes” in relation to the climate non-plan a few more times. “If it is not technology, it is taxes,” Taylor says. But the slight hitch with this is that no one is talking taxes. Taxes aren’t on the table. Labor hasn’t put forward taxes, it’s not something which is being discussed and no one has mentioned ‘carbon tax’ in quite sometime, because the world has moved on. It is not 2012. It’s 2021. As someone who sometimes inverts numbers, I can understand the confusion, so to make it clear – it is not 2012. No one is talking taxes. But there is something people are talking about though – tariffs. And that’s not the opposition saying that, it’s Australia’s trading allies. Basically, if Australia doesn’t come to the table, with an actual plan, and commitment, Australia’s trading partners will add tariffs to Australia’s exports. Which is not anything the opposition is considering – but the international community certainly is. Scott Morrison answers that question from Susan Templeman: The matter of mandatory vaccinations much aged care workers was the subject of a national cabinet decision attended by the premier of New South Wales, where all – with the exception of Victoria and the ACT, who have a different set of arrangements that relate to public health orders relating to aged care – all including the New South Wales Premier, agreed to put in place those public health orders and I have received several updates from the premier of New South Wales about their progress towards achieving that. I can only refer to those matters as they have been discussed between myself as prime minister and the premier of New South Wales. I can’t speak to the state of knowledge of the minister for health in New South Wales but I will ask the minister for health and Aged Care to add further to the answer. Greg Hunt: In relation to aged care staff at this stage, the latest advice I have is there have been 158,204 first vaccinations, or 57.5% of the workforce, 102,771 or 37.3% of the workforce or 260,975 all up. As the prime minister said in relation to the constructive work we have been able to do with all states and territories, on 28 June of 2021, national cabinet met and agreed to mandate that at least the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine be administered by mid-September 2021. That work was carried on on 28 July and 4 August in discussions by the aged care advisory committee of the AHPPC panel. On 2nd August, the AHPPC approved and published the guidelines which were then published 3 August, mandatory vaccination of residential aged care workers, that is publicly available. AHPPC has been meeting daily and this has been raised on multiple occasions on the advice of the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd to me today and on 10 August, following the West Australian public health order, further discussion of AHPPC and indeed the West Australian chief health officer only yesterday published the residential aged care facility worker access directions. It has been raised in health ministers’ meetings as a matter and what we are seeing is all states and territories making very good progress, not just with the vaccinations but also with the orders. We thank Western Australia for their work. We thank all the states and territories for their cooperation. Susan Templeman to Scott Morrison: The Morrison government promised aged care workers would be fully vaccinated against Covid by Easter. Four months on, more than half are still waiting. Today, the New South Wales minister for health said he’d never been asked by the Morrison government to put in place an order for mandatory vaccination of aged care workers. Will the prime minister take responsibility for his mess, which is leaving vulnerable Australians at risk? As a reminder, here is what Brad Hazzard said earlier today: The federal government is responsible for aged care. And if they want to ask me to put in place an order for that, I will. And I may also look at it. But can I tell you – the issue is, at the same time, there’s a lot of discussion going on in the community about mandatory vaccinations, and I think that needs to be sorted through. Certainly in terms of the federal government. They need to make sure that the area they regulate is actually getting what is needed and they need to make sure that the vaccines are getting to them as well. We’ve had to step up. The NSW government has stepped up to help the federal government in getting vaccinations for aged care workers. You might recollect that, originally, the federal government said that they would address all of that and they vaccinated a number of residents in aged care. They didn’t vaccinate the staff and I guess that was a supply issue, but I’m not sure why they didn’t, when they had people on deck at the aged care facilities. And I understand they’ve now agreed across the board that they will do whatever they can to try to get staff in the aged care facilities vaccinated with the first dose by the middle of September. And we are certainly supporting that. If any of the aged care workers, we’ve made it clear, any of the aged care workers who want to come to our hubs, we will vaccinate them. So we’re doing everything we can to assist them, and if at some stage, it moves to the point where we have to put an order in place, and that’s something that the federal government wants to do, we’ll do it. But that’s well off to mid-September. If they can tell us now and gave us that direction, I’d happily do it. But it’s their facility, their regulation and they’re responsible. Sussan Ley is bragging about how the Great Barrier Reef wasn’t listed as “in-danger” after lobbying from the government. Which just goes to show, despite what Scott Morrison said earlier, about politics not solving climate issues, politics can certainly make climate issues disappear from reports, if the lobbying is good enough. Michelle Rowland to Scott Morrison: On 24 June, eight days after the Bondi cluster began, the prime minister commended the premier of New South Wales for resisting a lockdown. Melbourne had tackled an outbreak of the Delta strain less than a month earlier. How many people have contracted Covid and been hospitalised since the prime minister told the premier she should resist taking necessary action to keep the community safe? Morrison: The figures I have that there are 297 people in New South Wales who are currently in hospital, 60 in ICU and 28 on ventilators. There were 356 cases today. I address this matter in a question, I think it was last week, or recently when the same matter was raised. It has been the case that, in the past, New South Wales has had success in being able to contain outbreaks and to be able to remain open. That is true. They were able to do that because New South Wales has been acknowledged, has had one of best testing, tracing, isolate and quarantine systems in – not just in Australia but in the world. But there has certainly been lessons learnt over the course of these past weeks and the government doesn’t deny that. When we came together as a national cabinet, we came to the agreed position across the national cabinet that it was necessary in phase A of this national plan that short, sharp lockdowns is what is necessary in response to the Delta variant. That is the response that the federal government supports and ... that is why we are backing up that policy with the economic supports that are put in place with the Covid disaster assistance payment which commences from the first day of any lockdown, consistent with the declaration of a commonwealth hot spot. It is why we have entered into financial support agreements with the states and territories, whether it be in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, to provide 50-50 support in funding the necessary business supports to make those lock downs a success. It is why the ADF have been sent in, we have pulled forward doses of the Pfizer vaccine in particular, 386,000 already being brought forward, on top of the existing allocations to New South Wales to address this outbreak in New South Wales. The Delta strain is a great challenge for the country, a great challenge for New South Wales right now and we are going to continue working together to combat the Delta strain in New South Wales and ensure we all get through this and I would seek the support of all in this chamber to support that program and not undermine those efforts. The issue with what Scott Morrison is talking about there though is, the Delta variant didn’t come out of the blue. Melbourne had already dealt with an outbreak of Delta, and then, the Morrison government was still pushing back against lockdowns, while dragging its feet on financial supports in lieu of Jobkeeper, because it didn’t want to provide financial incentives for states to lockdown. So it wasn’t new. There was a serious outbreak in Australia, of the Delta outbreak, in June. It was serious, Victorian authorities warned it was different, spoke of how easily it spread, its contagion and pushed the federal government to act. It also raised the issue of the outbreak in light of low vaccination numbers. There were warnings from overseas as well, that there was a very contagious new strain of covid which was pushing countries which had dealt with covid quite well in the first wave, to the limit. It’s not enough to just say now ‘delta is different’. There were many, many canaries in that coal mine, screaming their warnings before we got to this point. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Tragically, Covid infections in New South Wales reached a new daily record today. The NSW premier said today vaccination reduces your chance of spreading, reduces your chance of landing in hospital and it reduces your chance of dying. The NSW premier has also said it is a race. Will the prime minister admit that if he had not bungled the vaccine rollout, NSW would not be in the position it is today? Morrison: I don’t agree with the assertion put forward by the leader of the opposition. The federal government has ensured that NSW has been supported to the tune of 386,000 additional doses of Pfizer and on top of that over a million doses of AstraZeneca have been available. I am pleased at the strong response of the NSW government and the people of Sydney as they have been coming forward and the vaccination rates in Sydney have been lifting, particularly over the last few weeks during the course of the lock down, and in particular in the nine local government areas at the centre of the outbreak in NSW. We will continue to support the NSW government, both in supporting the effectiveness of the lockdown that is critical to suppressing this virus, the Delta strain, which has completely changed everything when it comes to the Covid response and the plans and the initiatives that are necessary in this phase of our four phase plan. It is vital that we seek to suppress the virus as much as we can in this phase so we can enter the next phase in the strong position that Australians have worked very hard to achieve. We know in other countries that have higher vaccination rates than Australia, whether in Singapore, the UK, Denmark - sorry in the Netherlands or other countries around the world, including China, where they have had to go back into lockdowns as a result of the Delta strain. The leader of the opposition, in raising that question today and putting it in that way, may wish to pretend that the Delta variant is a myth or he may wish to pretend it doesn’t change the responses that are necessary. He may seek to undermine the efforts of the government as we seek to support the NSW government in dealing with this outbreak. He has one job and that is to undermine the government, not support us in this effort. We will continue to support the NSW government and the people of NSW, whether it’s in mental health support, the Australian Defence Force on the ground, additional vaccines and targeting those vaccines, particularly in the areas most effected. Ensuring the regional communities who had vaccines taken away from them, 20,000 vaccines back into the Central Coast, back into the Hunter, back into Armidale and Tamworth which are also in lockdown. We continue to support the people of NSW as they go through one of the toughest challenges of this Covid-19 pandemic. This year I am advised by the minister for health that the number of cases in 2021 are already – almost 50% higher than the total number of cases in 2020. That is the difference in 2021 that the Delta variant of this virus is impacting on nations all around the world. The whole world is in a battle against the Delta strain of this virus and in this country, our country continues to perform. David Littleproud, taking a dixer, tries to introduce this into the climate talk: This is the Australian way of solving problems, not senseless vandalism. Not sure what the senseless vandalism he is referring to is. Much like “taxes” when it comes to this issue, no one is suggesting farming just get shut down. And the agriculture industry is responding, on its own, because the government isn’t. Stuart Robert has just referred to a “customer journey” for people using government websites. Those “customers” are the Australian people, utilising government services. They are not “customers” of the government. And yet, the man in charge of social services spending consistently refers to people as “customers”. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: I refer to reports that his government is trying to claw back $32m from low income individuals, including aged pensioners who received jobkeeper payments. Why is the Morrison government harassing and targeting ordinary Australians, but refusing to demand a refund from big corporations who banked $13bn in jobkeeper payments whilst their earnings and profits grew last year? Stuart Robert: As everyone knows in the house, governments have responsibilities of all persuasions to ensure the debts are recovered fairly, lawfully, transparently and respectfully. For example, as at August, $296.6m in overpayments has been recovered by the ATO, of which $185m in cash has been recovered. The ATO is fulfilling its responsibilities, in this case almost a third of a billion dollars in recovering. The same issue and the same standard applies to Australians. When jobseeker and jobkeeper were put into the Australian population, it was quite clear that Australians knew that you could not claim both. Indeed the customer journey for every Australian, when they went online or by using the telephony service had to actually read through and acknowledge in the same format and standard as if you were acknowledging a statutory declaration because that is the requirement of the law that all Services Australia government services or human services ministers have worked under for decades. They had to actually state that they were not taking jobseeker and jobkeeper. The government has a responsibility, as all governments have had to over the decades, to do targeted compliance as required by the Australian National Audit Office and that compliance showed that a number of Australians had unfortunately claimed both of them. The law requires the government to then respectfully go back to the Australian to point out to them that they’ve claimed both jobseeker and jobkeeper. The leader of the opposition says to me this is about the fair go. With great respect, sir, it’s actually about following the law and the law requires that overpayments are not allowed. The laws being administered by the ATO, $296m worth of overpayments being recovered, the law also requires that you can’t receive both jobkeeper and jobseeker and every Australian that applied for it acknowledged that they couldn’t receive both of those payments. Services Australia is now going forward and transparently and respectfully saying “You have claimed both” and is seeking to recover the debts lawfully, as required, that all governments have been required to do for decades and decades and decades. That’s the standard of a highly targeted welfare system that we all, as Australians, enjoy and that many members of the leader of the opposition’s front bench have administered over the years. Robodebt happened because the government did not follow the law – it was ruled as “unlawful” by the courts. And the government is not lifting a single finger to look at companies who made a profit with jobkeeper. Jobkeeper was confusing for a lot of people, many of who also received benefits which they subsidised with part-time or casual work. The issue is the double standard. Helen Haines to Scott Morrison: Today you said regional communities should not be forced to carry the national burden when it comes to climate change. Regional communities are already carrying this burden, drought, bushfires, floods and future trade costs. Our communities are suffering on top of this with delayed vaccines, lockdowns, economic hardship. But the regions are smart and ready to seize new opportunities, opportunities like community-owned renewable energy. You’re standing in the way. Why won’t you show the leadership that we need and commit to net zero emissions by 2050? Morrison: We should achieve net zero as soon as possible and preferably by 2050. That’s what the government’s policy has been. I can tell you this: I agree with the member that the impacts of climate change are impacted most greatly across our regions and the agricultural sectors, as we have seen across the country for many years, but that doesn’t mean they should shoulder the economic burden of that greater than other parts of the country, I am sure the member would agree when it comes to those issues. People in regional communities have shown the innovation, particularly our agricultural sector but also our minerals sector. In our mining sector, our global mining companies are leading the way when it comes to transforming their operations to net zero practices. Our farmers are doing it, our miners, our households are doing it and they are being enabled by the policies of the government to support them to do that. The way we address this is by ensuring the changes take place at that level right across the country and that no part of the country should have to carry a greater burden. Our policies are designed to support, whether it’s regions or other parts of the economy to make the transformations they are making because they can see that is not only in the country’s national environmental interests and the planet’s environmental interests but it is in their commercial interests and it is important for the future of their communities and their businesses and their farms and jobs. The member would, I’m sure, agree there are great anxieties about this issue in regional communities and we need to address those anxieties and assure people in regional parts of the country that the plan we have to achieve these outcomes is a plan they can support and a plan they can get behind. There are no blank cheques they are being asked to sign off on. They are not being asked to live up to a commitment where there is no plan and it’s very important we are straight with the Australian people about how we achieve these things and that they understand what is need and how we achieve the technological advances that are necessary to make this a reality, not just here but all around the world and particularly in developing countries. That is what we are seeking to do. I welcome the practical initiatives that the member has been putting forward and raising with the government on micro grids and micro grids, a policy of this government, as the member for Leichhardt is aware, these are the practical solutions that take us through to allow regional communities to transition and transform and not be left behind as a result of an unfunded, unplanned commitment that others would seek to make at a great cost to other Australians. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Why did the Morrison government advise Anne from Punchbowl who is in lockdown that she would lose her pension if she didn’t provide specific proof-of-age documents which she does not have? Especially given Anne is 102, bed-bound, has been a pensioner for 40 years and were it not for the intervention of my office would have had to travel in an ambulance to ServicesNSW to keep her pension. Stuart Robert gets this one: Thanks for the opportunity to respond to the question. Clearly, I’m not across the constituent’s details. ... I am not across the constituent’s details but my office or Minister Reynolds’ office will look at it for you. I am not sure why she would have been sent to ServicesNSW. Updating a pension document would be done online or with Services Australia but send the details through and we’re more than happy to look at it. Everyone’s circumstances are completely different and unique and without looking at the facts of the case, it’s difficult to give a concise answer. Send the details through, more than happy to come back to yourself or the house. In the Coalition party room, Nationals senator Sam McMahon announced a plan to seek to amend the EPBC Act to remove the prohibition on nuclear power, which received support from Matt Canavan. The pair later told the media the policy had been agreed by Nationals senators, which Guardian Australia understands occurred before the recent change in leadership back to Barnaby Joyce. Canavan conceded the move is unlikely to receive the necessary support, although McMahon claimed colleagues including some Liberals had supported it “privately”. Asked if removing the prohibition could shift his opposition to net zero emissions by 2050, Canavan replied that he “remains opposed” to a net zero target, claiming it will “send thousands of Australian jobs to other countries”. “I can’t see any way I would support a proposal that would not improve the environment but would cost our own jobs.” Canavan said his support for government spending on despatchable power applied to “all types of power” and noted that the government’s underwriting scheme is “technology neutral”. “If nuclear power stacked up, yeah, that is something that should be considered.” While “technology not taxes” is the eye-twitching mantra of the day, it is worth noting this story from Adam Morton in May: The Morrison government has vetoed public funding of a windfarm and battery project in northern Queensland, with a cabinet minister declaring it was inconsistent with its goals and policies. The Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif), a government agency, in January approved up to $280m funding for the Kaban green energy hub 80km south-west of Cairns. The proponents, Neoen Australia, estimated the development could reduce electricity prices for Queensland consumers by $461m over the life of the project. Keith Pitt, the minister for resources, water and northern Australia, blocked the loan in March. In a letter to the head of the agency, Pitt said the development would not provide “dispatchable” generation into the national electricity market and he was “not convinced” it would lower power prices. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: In response to last night’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the prime minister claimed today we need more technology and no one will be matching our ambition for a technology-driven solution. If that’s true, why did the prime minister claim that electric vehicles would end the weekend? Morrison: I will ask the minister for energy and emissions reduction to add to my answer but the claim made by the questioner is false and I will ask the minister to respond. Morrison on 7 April, 2019: Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles where you’ve got Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives. So not sure how the claim is false. Angus Taylor is trying to put words together, but you have heard them all before, but it says absolutely nothing. A very important point that needs to be screamed from the rooftops. Scott Morrison did not confront questions in the Coalition party room about lockdowns – but spoke at length about party unity in the context of the government’s Covid response. Morrison said that Australia had the “lowest fatality rate in the world” from Covid-19, and that hopefully Australia would see “families coming together at Christmas, and everyone you hope to be around the table is around the table”, in reference to not losing family members to Covid. After Australia’s slow start to the vaccination rollout, Morrison acknowledged there had been “frustration in the first half” but claimed the government had “turned it around in the second half”. Morrison said that he knew “as a Sharks supporter you don’t win the game in the first half you win in the second half”, and recalled West Coast’s win in the fourth quarter of the 2018 AFL grand final. Morrison noted sacrifices that Australia has made in lockdown and in paying economic supports. He said: So the suggestion that somehow we would now say it’s all too hard is absurd - no - Australians have worked too hard to put us in the position we are now and we must preserve that until we move into the next phase. We will get there.” Morrison said he was “grateful to lead a united team, where individuals have put aside things important to them personally” because the Coalition is “a party not a nest of independents” to be “united and focused on the goal of government”. He said: You win together and you lose apart – we have to keep focusing on what we’re fixing and how that’s making a difference.” It’s OK when they [constituents] tell you they’re angry – we all are. No one likes lockdowns and the impacts on businesses. It’s the virus doing this – we have to keep reminding people of what’s ahead.” Australia is now achieving vaccination rates of 250,000 doses a day, comparable to the per capita rates in the US and UK at their peaks. Anthony Albanese starts off by “disassociating” Labor with George Christensen’s comments, which he says are a “disgrace” to people who lost their lives in the pandemic. He is told to get to his question. Albanese: Before the horror 2019/20 bushfires, the prime minister ignored warnings from former fire chiefs that Australia was unprepared for the dangers. Now the intergovernmental panel on climate change warns: “The intensity, frequency of duration of fire weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia.” Will the prime minister ignore this warning too? Morrison (unleashing the passive language): Australia has not ignored any of those warnings. Our government has been acting on those warnings each and every day. That is why emissions reductions have been 20% on 2005 levels. It is why we have installed 7GW of renewable energy capacity in 2020, this is around eight times faster than New Zealand, Japan, Italy and the global average per person. It’s three times faster than Germany and the EU. It is why we have the highest rate of solar uptake on roofs in the world. It is why we have met and beaten our Kyoto target and we will meet and beat our Paris target. It is why we remain steadfast committed to the Paris agreement as a Government. It is why we have invested $20bn in ensuring the technology that not just Australia needs but developing countries, not just in our region like Indonesia and Vietnam and Papua New Guinea and other countries seeking to ensure that they can develop their economies, but do so in a way that deals with a world net zero economy of the future. We know that every household, farms, businesses, small and large, are making the changes, whether it be in the mining industry, whether it be in the agricultural sector, in manufacturing, wherever it will be, they are supported in the decisions they are taking because of the serious issues that have been confirmed by the IPCC report once again. We will continue to take action. We must continue to take action. Performance matters and performance counts. Australia is the only country to the best of our knowledge, who reports quarterly on our emissions reductions. Every sector, every gas, every quarter. I wish other countries did the same but that’s what Australia does because Australia knows that the way we achieve this is by equipping our industries, our farmers, equipping Australians who are passionately committed to addressing this urgent action and urgent action that our government is supporting them to take through the policies that we put in place. We are careful to explain to Australians what the costs are involved and how we will manage those risks. There won’t be handing over of blank cheques on this issue from our government. We will ensure that we can work with Australians, whether they be in regional areas, the suburbs of our cities or wherever they happen to be, we will carry this burden together but we will ensure that burden does not fall on some Australians like in regional Australia and they are carrying the burden for the rest of us. We will ensure our plan addresses their needs and takes all of Australia with us in addressing this very serious global challenge. We get the member for Stirling for 20 seconds. He is a “MASSIVE FAN OF OCEANS”. That is capped because he all but bellowed it. He’s cut short by question time. Much like his time as the member for Stirling, after his electorate was scrapped in the latest redistribution A little update on a story we brought you this morning on thousands of students waiting to get back to Australia to resume in-person classes: In an interview with Guardian Australia, India’s high commissioner to Australia, Manpreet Vohra, raised concerns over the impact of extended travel bans on thousands of students who cannot get here to take up their studies. He is asking the government to give students hope about when they might be able to get here in a Covid-safe way, saying online education was “not what they signed up for”. It turns out the federal government has quietly begun planning a campaign “to promote Australia’s world-class education opportunities to prospective students and their parents in India”. Austrade has published a contract with a supplier, worth about $200,000, for “Study Australia India campaign”. When asked about the contract, an Austrade spokesperson said it was to develop campaign assets. “It includes provision for work to extend the Study Australia Masterclass series which showcases Australia’s capability and capacity across a range of global sectors and world issues utilising some of our inspirational academics. The campaign offers students options to start their studies now from home online or to consider their study in Australia options when conditions allow.” The Austrade spokesperson added that a suite of Study Australia digital resources “has been designed to support current students onshore and offshore, and to promote the range of options available to prospective students now and post-pandemic”. But it may not be launched immediately. The Austrade spokesperson said the timing of the campaign rollout in India was yet to be confirmed: “Pandemic conditions are being monitored to determine the best time.” Over in the House, the 90 second statements are happening and George Christensen, a government backbencher, has just spent his time raging against lockdowns. “End this madness,” he says. Which probably happened when he sat back down, but I don’t think that was his point. Adam Bandt: Scott Morrison’s denial is putting Australian lives at risk. His 2030 targets are a death sentence. It is crystal clear, from this latest report, that we could have 1.5 degrees, which is one of the limits set in the Paris agreement, as early as next decade. 1.5 degrees, extreme droughts, happened twice as often as they did before. Scott Morrison’s targets are a recipe for more droughts in Australia that are worse when they come, for more extreme weather events, and for a wrecking ball to be smashed through our economy and our society, stopping other countries are stepping up to the plate and Scott Morrison is refusing to do so. These 2030 targets from Scott Morrison are a death sentence but Labor has no 2030 targets at all. The Labor silence on 2030 is letting Scott Morrison off the hook at one of the most crucial times in history. Bill Shorten has responded to Luke Henriques-Gomes story highlighting that the government is chasing debts from people who received jobkeeper – but not companies which received jobkeeper and made a profit: Scott Morrison doesn’t understand how hard people are doing it during lockdown. At the same time Mr Morrison is gifting $13bn to big corporations who increased earnings during the Covid lockdowns, he is sending out his goons to collect a few dollars off people who lost their jobs. There are two rules in Scott Morrison’s Australia: If you’re a big corporation, they’ll throw millions at you, but if you are a battler they’ll chase you for everything you’ve got. Have the people who brought us robodebt learnt nothing. They’re still working on cleaning up the parliament forecourt as well. Nick Evershed has been working his data magic again. They are still working to clean off the spray painted “climate duty of care” on the Lodge’s outer walls. It’s now 30 minutes until question time. Prepare yourself for a lot of “plan” talk using the most passive language imaginable. Chris Bowen addressed the Smart Energy Council this morning and spoke on the IPCC report – and of course, the Morrison government: When the IPCC report has starkly laid out the costs of inaction on climate change and compelling benefits of action. Not just for the world, but for Australia in particular. The report supports what I regard as two key elements of successfully winning the climate change debate: agency and urgency. In other words, it is not too late to act, but we must act with speed. As fires rage through Greece, we are reminded of our own terrible black summer. And the IPCC report is clear: heat extremes have increased in Australia, and, I quote, ‘the intensity, frequency and duration of weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia’ (high confidence). You will recall that this is not the first warning that Scott Morrison has received about climate change and natural disasters in Australia. He refused to meet with the group of eminent former Fire Chiefs who wanted to warn him that the 2019/20 fire season was going to catastrophic due to climate change. He ignored that warning. He will also ignore this one. His government is so divided and dysfunctional on the key question of climate policy that he cannot even commit his government to the essential starting point: net zero by 2050. Pauline Hanson now wants the international border shut to any non-Australian because of “dangerous” Covid variants. She released a statement: Australia’s international border should be closed to non-Australian citizens until Christmas to protect the nation from variants of Covid-19 which the government claims are more dangerous. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson said Prime Minister Scott Morrison should shut the international border or kiss his government goodbye. Given how many regional communities (Hanson’s traditional base) rely on migrant workforces, it’s probably not the greatest of long-term ideas. But then that has never been her thing. This is the same Hanson who proudly boasted she is not vaccinated, because it’s “her choice”. This is already being cleaned up. Over in the Senate, Penny Wong wants to debate a motion acknowledging the IPCC report and calling on the government to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. The government did not support the motion. There is a brief reprieve before question time which is in just over an hour, so I’m going to take a look over the morning and see if there was anything I missed in that glut of information – but you should all treat yourselves to a tiny break. In the Coalition party room, Nationals senator Sam McMahon announced an intention to move an amendment to the EPBC Act to allow for nuclear power, which is currently banned in Australia. That contribution was supported by Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who noted a nuclear power plant would still have to go through environmental approvals before it could be built. McMahon and Canavan will stand up at 1.15pm to discuss this nuclear push. Guardian Australia understands the plan had already passed the Nationals Senate party room before the leadership change. The Coalition party room also heard from Scott Morrison on the government’s “technology not taxes” approach to emissions reduction and its approach to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of most interest there was the fact Morrison warned colleagues not to throw away Australia’s early success against Covid by unlocking too early, labelling it “absurd” that Australia should say it is too hard to suppress Delta until more Australians are vaccinated. He spoke in rugby league and Australian rules metaphors – games of two halves or four quarters – with the Sharks winning their games in the second half, and West Coast winning the 2018 grand final in the fourth quarter. The point being: the rollout started slow but judge us by where we end up. Ben Moreton presented some new electoral bills, including one to shorten pre-poll voting to no more than two weeks. The bills were supported, the only pushback here was from some including Nicolle Flint who think the government should go further to ensure security around polling booths, for example by banning people canvassing voters at polling stations. Another contributor questioned why the government doesn’t allow online voting. The Greens have held their party room meeting - mainly to discuss their tactics in the Senate to draw attention to the IPCC climate report and the issue of global heating. The Greens are going to throw the kitchen sink at it, targeting both the government for its inadequate emissions reduction target and Labor for edging away from upping the ambition for 2030. They’ll try to suspend standing orders, second reading amendments in unrelated bills and seek an order for production of documents regarding what the Australian government told the IPCC before the report. There’s also an order of production of documents relating to the Beetaloo basin gas funding. Remember when the major parties teamed up to prevent motions that required them to vote expressing a view on this or that? It seems like the Greens brains trust has found some alternative ways to bring issues to the Senate’s attention. The Greens also want to amend the government’s respect at work bill to add recommendations that it didn’t support, such as a call for employers to have a positive duty to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace. As noted yesterday, the Senate will also vote this afternoon on Janet Rice’s bid for a parliamentary inquiry into the commuter car park fund, with all eyes on the casting votes in One Nation. NBN Co has reported what CEO Stephen Rue says is “another strong year of performance” with revenue rising 21% year on year to $4.6bn in the company’s full-year results on Tuesday. Labor wrote in July to the auditor-general asking to consider reviewing NBN bonuses as part of its review of the governance of bonuses, following the revelation NBN Co paid out over $77m in bonuses last year. Part of its criticism of NBN in the letter is that the company consistently writes down its revenue targets from the corporate plan over time, until the point where NBN can easily meet those targets in the actual year. For example, the revenue target for FY21 was originally $5.4bn in 2018, but was revised down to $4.5bn in the most recent corporate plan, which NBN was able to just pass in its latest results. In the letter, Labor has questioned whether the bonuses are paid against these targets Labor says are “artificially low”. When asked about why the target had changed over the past few years, Rue said there were “many different things” that had changed, including pricing changes, the impact of Covid, and the need for bandwidth discounts with more working from home. He said long term forecasting would change over time: When you do long term projections you make certain assumptions, and also assumptions can prove to be very, very correct or they can prove to vary depending upon the circumstances of the day. So for example, several years back we didn’t project a $4.5bn further investment into our business and that therefore would get that would then get factored into future long term projections. So, I think, I think with any long term projection and company you can chart the trends as being appropriate, but it can certainly take a one year budget as absolute guidance for the year ahead. But longer term projections always get changed with whatever happens in the economy, in society or within your business or within competition. Rue said questions about bonuses would need to wait until the company’s annual report was released. One slightly interesting and weird thing to come out of the Victorian press conference is the health minister seemingly saying that vaccine efforts have been hampered by a lack of AstraZeneca supply. Martin Foley: Yesterday we also saw cars roll up to the first drive-through vaccination centre in Australia at the old Bunnings in Melton, and can I just reinforce that you just can’t drive up. You’ve got to book – we don’t want people being disappointed ... because we still have constraints on supply. But according to the federal government we are basically swimming in the stuff. So what’s the problem? Here is what Foley had to say when asked how much AstraZeneca Victoria currently had its hands on: The last I looked it was over 200,000. But we have put a fair dint in that over recent days. In terms of the actual number, given that it’s actually made just up the road, I’d have to get back to you. But what we want to make sure is that the safe message that AstraZeneca is available and works and is going to be increasingly available is heeded by as many people. Q: When you talk about supply being the issue, if we have 200,000 AstraZeneca doses, what is the constraint with opening up more mass vaccination hubs or more appointments at those hubs? Foley: We are getting it out as soon as it’s allocated to us by the commonwealth ... As soon as it gets to us we get it out. There is also no word yet on whether Victoria will be coming out of lockdown as scheduled. Martin Foley: It is really a day-to-day proposition, and sometimes an hour-to-hour proposition. But we’ve seen one case a couple of days ago being in quarantine, now we’ve got five and what we want to do is obviously improve on that trend. That’s in the hands of everyone in metropolitan Melbourne to follow the rules, it’s in the hands of all of us in Victoria to get tested at the slightest of symptoms. I don’t know what the future brings. The crystal ball hasn’t fired up lately. What we’ll do is follow the public health advice as it comes in. On the new cases in Victoria, the state’s deputy secretary of Covid response Kate Matson says: Ten of those are linked to CS square in Caroline Springs. I’ll break down those 10. Four of them are linked to YPA real estate – three work at that estate agency, one is a household contact. Three are linked to the Jolly Miller Cafe, one worker and two household contacts. One is a worker at the Pacific Smiles Dentist, and the other two have attended the shopping centre precinct in general. That’s 10 cases. Three cases are linked to the Newport football club, one a player, one a social contact of a confirmed case and one a household contact. That brings us to 13. Three cases are linked to Mount Alexander College, two are students and one a household contact, bringing us to 16. Two are household contacts from the original Newport family cluster that we announced last week, 18 cases. One is a student at Al-Taqwa College, and the final case is linked to the Jolly Miller Cafe but relates to a second workplace ... so that’s 20 cases. As Jeroen mentioned, we are very concerned about CS Square and Caroline Springs, and 10 cases today are [from] that retail setting. It’s a reminder for all Victorians to check in everywhere every time. It looks like the area Victorian health authorities are most acutely worried about is a popular shopping centre in Caroline Springs, in Melbourne’s west. Victoria’s Covid-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar reiterated that the shopping centre is now a tier 2 exposure site for a period of 10 days up to August 5, meaning any shoppers who went there must get tested immediately and isolate until they are confirmed to be negative. There are 111 active cases of coronavirus in Victoria at the moment ... 76 of those are associated with the current outbreak and the remainder are a combination of the old cases coming off the previous outbreak and some hotel quarantine cases. The area of most concern to us today is Caroline Springs and continues to be Caroline Springs. We have seen now 25 cases associated with the Caroline Springs Square shopping centre across a number of different ... retail units and people. Some of those are household contacts. We confirmed the entirety of the Caroline Springs Square shopping centre as a tier 2 site between 27 July and 5 August. I would again urge everybody who has been to that shopping centre over that period, please come forward and get tested immediately if you have not already done so. While all of that was happening, Victoria also held its press conference and gave the good news that there is no one in a Victorian ICU because of covid. Matilda Boseley was listening in: Yesterday was the first day that Victorian vaccination hubs were open for anyone over the age of 18 to receive the AstraZeneca jab. State health minister Martin Foley: We administered 2,366 first doses of that vaccine yesterday. That is a more than threefold increase when compared to the Monday of the previous week. Victoria administered 22,670 vaccination’s yesterday, the biggest day of jabs in months. This was helped by a pop-up clinic set up at Al-Taqwa College, which is the site of one of the state’s current outbreaks. Students over 16 who come to get tested at the school ground have been offered a Pfizer jab. Foley: [The] clinic has so far administered 1,252 doses, in a school community that size, [this] has been extraordinary. That’s more than half the school and keep in mind that many of the families had also gone to other vaccination centres, be it the big hub at Sunshine, the showgrounds, the GP networks and a range of others. Some have already in fact been vaccinated. Adam Morton and Katharine Murphy are going to go through that press conference and fact check it for you, so you can see the difference between the spin and the reality. Because no matter what they say, Australia has no commitment to net zero by 2050 (which is not no emissions by the way, it’s just net zero emissions), the Morrison government is still held hostage (and therefore so is the country) by a small group in the party room, and the main plan is to rely on technology which is yet to be invented, while sprouting off lines like “technology not taxes” (no one is suggesting taxes), “meet and beat” (which is misleading at best) and “we care about climate action”. After just 30 minutes and more questions to be asked, Scott Morrison leaves the press conference. Scott Morrison calls last question and takes one on Covid. What I do think remains really important in NSW, and not just for those in Sydney, but for the rest of the country, the whole country, Australians have worked so hard to get us to the situation we are in right now, where we have been able to keep the cases relatively low, compared to the rest of the world. We have one of the lowest death rates in the world from Covid and we want to be able to continue to achieve that as best as we possibly can as we continue through this suppression phase and that’s why there aren’t any short cuts to lockdowns. You have got to make them work as best as you possibly can. So in Sydney, please stay home. Unless you really have an urgent need to go and do something outside the house, for other states, that are going through similar lockdowns now, then please do the same thing. Because we need to keep those cases low. I want to get there by Christmas, but I want everyone around the table at Christmas. What about the cost of inaction? Will there be modelling done on the cost of inaction? Scott Morrison: Well the need to take action is informed by that very point. The cost of inaction globally is very clear, in what the IPCC report sets out today. The government needs no further motivation about the need to take action. That’s why we are taking it. That’s why we invested $20 billion over the next 10 years into the technology that transforms this. So it is quite clear that my government understands the need to take action because of the broader cost. There is not a direct correlation between the action that Australia takes and the temperature in Australia. I don’t think anyone is suggesting that. The temperature in Australia is determined by what’s happening all over the world. We understand that. Australia has to be part of that. Australia is part of that. Australia is performing as part of that. And Australia will continue to perform and we will continue to do more and more and more and I’m going to take the entire country with us on that to ensure that all Australians have a future. Whenever they live today. And they are able to do that based on an economic and an environmental plan that helps them achieve that which we are transparent about and very clear about Australians. So Angus Taylor says we are taking projections to Glasgow for 2030, and then Scott Morrison will get to telling people what that might be. I’ll make further comments about this about Glasgow and we update our commitments every year. So if there is anything further to say at that time I will say it at that time. This says absolutely nothing (which is pretty much the same as this government’s plan on climate action). Scott Morrison: No what I’m saying today is what I have been consistently saying for a very long time. Australia under my government will have a plan to achieve what we are setting out. He goes on: We will be transparent with Australians about what it means. I don’t make blank cheque commitments. I leave that to others. Blank cheque commitments you always end up paying for. And you always end up paying for it in high taxes. That’s what the alternative approach is. That’s not my approach. That’s never been my approach. My approach is finding practical solutions to what are very practical problems and that practical problem is ensuring that the technology that works here needs to work in other parts of the world and we are positioning Australia to be in the forefront of that and our hydrogen strategy, the carbon capture and storage, the soil carbon, all of those initiatives is about positioning Australia to be successful in that world. There are a lot of screams being heard in response to this press conference: Scott Morrison: The government’s policy is clear. And the government’s position is very clear. We need to take action to address climate change. And are. It’s also the government’s job. In fact it’s everybody in this building’s job to take all Australians forward with this on this. There are many Australians right across the country, whether they live in our suburbs or in regional areas, who have got anxieties about the changes and what it means for them. Will they have a job? Will their kids have a job? Will their electricity prices go up? They have serious concerns about that and we can’t be flippant about those or dismiss them. I don’t. I take them seriously and that’s why the sensible responsible action that our government is taking and having a plan to achieve these things and explaining it to Australians, as I did before the last election, on our 2030 commitments, and will continue to is so important, because we are a very big country. The pressures on Australians are different right across the country and we can’t be blind to them. We need to be open to them and we need to explain how the policies, we are putting in place, is protecting them and their future, their jobs, but also their future. And that’s why what our policies are designed to achieve. Those industries the prime minister is mentioning there, farming, mining etc, taking action are doing it because the government is not. That sound you hear is the scream of environmental researchers around the nation at hearing the prime minister say Australia is one of the most transparent nations in the world on emissions data. As Adam Morton and Katharine Murphy have both reported, numerous times, we like to play a lot of games with our emissions data. Here is Scott Morrison, who not so long ago held up coal in the parliament and told people not to be afraid of it, speaking of how great we are on emissions: We need more technology and no one will be matching our ambition for a technology-driven solution*. Because I believe that’s what will work. And we of course will be updating where we are up to on what we expect to achieve in 2030 when the Glasgow summit is held. We will definitely do that. As I said, Australia is the most transparent country in the world when it comes to our reporting on emissions reductions. And I will be calling on the rest of the world to match our transparency. They should. One of the reasons it is so hard to compare Australia’s strong performance against other countries is that because you have to go back several years. Because that’s the latest data you can get from so many countries. I think the reporting arrangements and transparency that sits around emissions reduction is a key tool. Angus makes a very good point about what’s being achieved in – on households and on soils. See, Australian businesses, Australian farmers, Australian manufacturers, Australian miners, they are making the change now. It’s happening. There is not a shop floor I walk into, a mine I go down in, there is not a farm I visit that is not already making changes. And a point I make particularly to those overseas that one of the biggest movers in transforming how they move to a net zero business is our mining and resources industry. Whether it’s what Andrew Forest is doing in Fortescue and his work in hydrogen or what Rio and BHP are also doing in those areas. The biggest miners are having the biggest performance outcomes in how they are transforming our businesses. Australian businesses. Australian farmers, Australian manufacturers are transforming what they are doing. Why? Because they get it. They get it. Those Australians get it. They know where the world is heading and they know the changes that any need to make to be competitive in that world and to be successful in that world. Our policies are supporting that. The changes that they are making, our policies have been supporting and that’s why Australia has been able to reduce its emissions more than so many advanced economies around the world. * It remains a technology ambition because the technology doesn’t exist as yet. As Adam Morton says on the “technology not taxes” line: The government’s response on Monday was to repeat its mantra that “technology, not taxes” could solve the problem. It’s a slogan that ignores that taxes pay for technology development, and technology that can make a difference already exists and, in the words of the ClimateWorks Australia chief Anna Skarbek, is in many cases “mature and available”. The world still needs better technology, but it also needs policy that deploys the available technology at a pace that recognises the scale of the threat. Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison are both speaking about solar take-up as proof Australia is doing its part. Yes, there has been a high take-up of solar power in Australia. Because of state-based policies, which provided subsidies for installation and very generous feed-in-tariffs to get people across the line. On emissions falling, as Adam Morton reports: In reality, as analyses by government officials and others have shown, fossil fuel use in Australia has barely moved. The government has been able to claim it is taking action purely because the historically rapid rate of forest clearing for farming, logging and development slowed – but not stopped – earlier this decade. This land-based fall in emissions mostly happened under Labor, not the Coalition, and mostly had nothing to do with federal policy. It was possible only because Australia has not yet finished cutting down its native forests. Most other wealthy nations were cleared centuries ago. Here is the key point, as spelled out this week in a study by energy analyst Hugh Saddler: if changes in farming and land-clearing are excluded, fossil fuel emissions in Australia increased by more than 6% between 2005 and when Covid-19 struck. Try selling that number as evidence of an inevitable economic transformation under way. There is a lot in this press conference already, which is simply just rewriting reality. I urge you to read this from Adam Morton where he addresses a lot of these issues: Scott Morrison is now going harder on the Extinction Rebellion protesters than he has on the anti-vaxxer and anti-lockdown protesters: I tell you what the Australian way isn’t, the Australian way is not what we have seen with the vandalism in our capital today. I don’t associate in any way, shape or form that foolishness with the good-hearted nature of Australians who care deeply about this issue, as I do. And my government does. I don’t associate them with this. They have no part with that foolishness today. Any more than we have seen in other selfish protests around this country. Australians care deeply about this issue and so does our government. Action will be taken against those who have committed those offences in our capital today, as they should. And I think Australians who, regardless of what their position on this issue, would agree with that. That is not the way we go forward. There is a woman that I waved to almost every morning when I come into this building, as I drive up, and there is often people as you all know who will be putting their point across peacefully and calmly down there on the ramp coming up into Parliament House. She’s there almost every morning, and she makes this point every day, and she gives me a wave and she gives me a smile. I tell you what, I’m listening to her. I’m listening to Australians about this issue. And more than that, we are taking action that I think will actually make the difference. This is a very defensive speech from the prime minister. Not sure who he is talking to here – whether it is world leaders ahead of the climate meeting in November, his party room, or voters. Scott Morrison: Australia is part of the solution, Australia is doing its part as part of the solution. And Australia will continue to do more as part of that solution because we understand what it means for our country. Our commitments are backed up by plans. And we don’t make them lightly. We consider them carefully. Australians deserve to know the implications and the costs and what the plans are. I did that before the last election. I said what our 2030 commitment was, I explained how I thought we would get there. I explained the costs to Australians and Australians supported us. I will do that again as we go into the commitments later this year. I will do it again before the next election. I won’t be signing a blank cheque on behalf of Australians to targets without plans. We will set out a clear plan as we have been working to do. Australians deserve to know and they will from us, regional communities should not be forced to carry the national burden and I won’t let them. Essentially the message here is Australia doesn’t need to change (despite allies like the UK and Europe calling for an end to fossil fuels like coal) it just needs to focus on technology being invented. Scott Morrison: We will still have serious issues when it comes to how this virus would continue to impact on the planet. It’s no different when it comes to addressing the challenge of global climate change. Unless we can get the change in the developing countries of the world then what we are seeing in the IPCC reports will occur. And so we need to take a different approach. We need to focus on the technological breakthroughs that are necessary to change the world, and how we operate. And make sure that is done right across the world. Not just in advanced countries, it’s not enough. Australia is, must and continue to do its part and Australia has a strong track record of performance. And we intend for that to continue to increase in the years ahead and Angus [Taylor] will speak more to that, about what’s being achieved and what’s being planned and how that is occurring. Australia is part of the solution, our emissions have fallen by 20% since 2005. We are the only country to our knowledge that engages in the transparency of reporting our emissions reductions every sector, every gas, every quarter. No other country to our knowledge does that. They may do it on this one or that one, but not every – not every sector, every gas, and every quarter. Scott Morrison then moves on to talk technology (much of which we are still waiting to be invented). World history teaches one thing. Technology changes everything. That is the game changer. Governments, political leaders, can pretend to these things, but I’ll tell you what makes the difference – technology changes on the ground. And that is why our approach is technology and not taxes to solving this problem. It’s not enough for the technology to work with a tax in an advanced economy. That doesn’t solve the problem, because it doesn’t solve the problem in India. It doesn’t solve the problem in Vietnam or in Indonesia or in China or in South Africa. It doesn’t solve the problem. The emissions keep going on. So what is important is we ensure the technology breakthroughs that are necessary to transform the world over the next 10, 20, and 30 years are realised. Scott Morrison then goes on the defensive when it comes to the IPCC report: We must take action as we, indeed are, and continue to take action as we will continue to in developed countries and advanced economies. But we cannot ignore the fact that the developing world accounts for two-thirds of global emissions and those emissions are rising. That is a stark fact. It is also a clear fact that China’s emissions account for more than the OECD combined. Now, I make that point, not to say that we should be opposing taxes on these countries – quite the contrary. I totally understand and accept that the advanced world, the advanced economies of the world, have developed their economies over a long time, principally on the basis of fossil fuel industries. That is accepted. And I think it’s a very fair argument that the developing world makes, which says – why should our economic futures be denied when advanced economies around the world have been able to go forward on that basis of their energy economies over a long period of time? I think that’s a very fair point. But it doesn’t change the calculus of climate change. The Australian approach is not to tax them or deny them the employment and the jobs and the industries that they should have, just as we should have them here in this country, but to enable. The prime minister starts with a small speech on NSW: The news out of NSW today is hard news. Really difficult news – 356 cases, four reported deaths. We are in a tough, tough fight with this Delta strain. A tough fight. And I want to thank everyone across NSW, right across the country, other places going through lockdowns as well. But we know that the fight in NSW is the toughest of all those fights and there’s a lot at stake. Now, I want Australia to get to Christmas, but I want everybody around that table at Christmas time. And we will do everything we can to achieve that goal. NSW finished its press conference. We then jump to the prime minister, who is holding a press conference on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. There is a clear blame shift to the NSW community in this press conference. Brad Hazzard: My frustration here is that you would have to be living under a rock not to know that we have a serious issue with Covid in south-west Sydney. And then to deliberately go to Newcastle or outside Sydney with no apparent reasonable excuse is just completely unacceptable. But that’s the sort of thing we’re getting and it’s enormously frustrating. I’ve got to say, I think that the police are doing an amazing job. They do have, for example, registration plate detection and they can see who is coming from where and that’s causing them to be able to stop people. And they are, as you heard from the deputy commissioner, turning people around. And where there are clear breach, they take action. In terms of compliance, seven vehicles were turned around yesterday by police. Gladys Berejiklian: Police stopped and turned around seven vehicles yesterday. Seven times yesterday, the NSW police prevented someone potentially spreading the to us the region. Thank you to the police force and the Australian Defence Force for doing that. As Deputy Commissioner Worboys said, they prevented and tracked down people who should have been staying at home and weren’t at home. Again, another example of what they need to do. If there are additional recommendations we get from Dr Chant, of course we’ll consider and implement those. Gladys Berejiklian has another “please know” (one of her favourite phrases) – this time that the police minister and AG are consulted regularly as part of the NSW crisis cabinet. So how do the police stop people from travelling to the regions? Deputy commissioner Gary Worboys: I think that the way that we get to that, the quickest, is that people abide by the public health orders themselves. What we are seeing is people making conscious decisions to go outside, to contravene the public health orders at a risk to themselves and the community and the whole strategy around getting NSW back to normal as quickly as possible. I’ve outlined what happened in Northbridge and, just in the last 24 hours, a significant police presence. Traffic and highway patrol, local police, our transport command in pulling over vehicles and making sure that they had a good and proper reason to travel. Some were turned around and some issued with penalty infringement notices. That will not only happen in northern but in western and southern regions and we’ll continue to treat Greater Sydney in terms of its merits where the transmission is, where people need additional efforts around compliance that will happen. And NSW police have shown that they are up to the task. It’s reviewed every day at our police operations centre that is working 24-7 on the police deployment issue. We’re assisted by the ADF. We’re in a very good position to continue to ratchet up that compliance, that visibility and that policing effort to make sure that people comply with public health orders. Is the contact tracing system too stressed? Dr Kerry Chant: Case numbers are increasing and obviously that stresses all parts of the system. Both the operational health aspects of the system and our contact tracers. However, we have scaled up and I want to acknowledge the role of Defence in coming forward to help us as well as part of our team approach to contact tracing. But I just want to explain that why you don’t immediately know about a venue is because a person gets a test, the test result might come back 24-48 hours later and then you interview the person. And so, obviously, you take the two days before you find out that they’ve got symptoms and. unfortunately, some people actually have symptoms for a while. I mean, unfortunately, the reason we, for instance, announced the lockdown in relation to the Northern Rivers is because we knew that that gentleman was in infectious in the community for upwards of eight days, as were potentially the children as well. So they’re factors. If we can have people coming forward at the earliest symptoms for getting tested, that will also help us. But it is not working is it? Dr Kerry Chant: Once you’ve got that force of infection, it’s really hard to turn it around. And that’s why I think we all need to redouble our efforts. And I just ... I appreciate that those communities have been heavily impacted. But there is also the disease burden in those communities. And so, I think it is ... I think that we need to further work with those communities to really ensure that compliance ... And as I said, it’s a whole of government approach to supporting those communities to adhere to the public health orders. So what exactly then? Dr Kerry Chant: My public health advice is that we need to put in further look at how we can stop people going into the regions. How? Chant: I’m not in the position to understand the operational impacts of how you would do it. So that’s been passed on to police and police have put in an increased regime of compliance. A curfew? Chant: I think that the evidence about curfews is not strong. But I think what I’m concerned about is the crowding in shopping centres and places where we have seen transmission events in small shops. So I’ve asked police particularly to focus on adherence to those density restrictions. I think I’ve repeatedly messaged about the fact that I really want people to be staying outside of shops and waiting outside and going in almost one at a time into shops. It is seven weeks in and numbers aren’t going down (although vaccinations are obviously increasing). So does something different need to be done? Chant: Government is always considering about how better to support the community to comply. So I think that the premier has announced additional support and we’ve certainly provided funding to the non-government organisations to better support the communities through organisations such as Red Cross and others. So those strategies will mean that there are less barriers for people doing the wrong thing. And I think the government is actively looking at a range of strategies. So what exactly does Dr Kerry Chant want to see? There’s the issue of the orders and what is the rules? And there’s the issue of the community complying with those. As I said, a large proportion of the community do. But a small proportion of the community don’t. And that requires a whole of government action and one is to support people with food and access so they don’t have to take actions to go to work when they’re sick. It’s about policing in terms of increasing compliance. It’s also about working with community leaders to better explain, as the premier has said. There are some communities where we need to increase the understanding about the seriousness of Covid – how it’s transmitted and the implications. We also need to discuss vaccination. If there was a simple silver bullet, that would be the case. But from my public health perspective, I’m not happy that the case numbers are increasing and we certainly need to do all we can. But compliance will be one of those components of it. So what else needs to be done then? Dr Kerry Chant: In general terms, we need to further decrease mobility and the community needs to adhere to the orders. So we’re still seeing a lot of unnecessary movement of people. We’re also seeing compliance gaps. I mean, an example – when I was talking to one of my public health units, that they reported a case had visited ... a partner had visited a close contact. These are not the actions that we want to see when we’re dealing with a virus as transmissible as Covid. So, for me, decreasing mobility, decreasing the possibly for interactions. Meeting the density restrictions. Adhering to your local government areas if you’re in those affected communities and also for people outside – not going into those affected communities. We need to do more if we’re going to see the case numbers drop down. Dr Kerry Chant is then asked if it was her advice that further restrictions won’t work. Chant says that is not what she heard the premier say. Gladys Berejiklian jumps in to say she didn’t say that – she was talking about particular restrictions. I’m sorry, this is a very important point. I was asked about specific actions and why they weren’t taken and I said very clearly that if we need to do more, of course we would based on the health advice. But we’re not in the business of putting in provisions or asking people to do things if they’re not going to have an effect in reducing the case numbers. Now, that is a very important point to make. We are all about reducing the case number, increasing vaccination rates and we’ll take any action we need to. There’s a lot of crosstalk from reporters all asking questions at once, to which Berejiklian says “people at home don’t like when you do that”. Should all health workers in NSW be vaccinated? Brad Hazzard: I am of the view, as the health minister, that I would like to see all health workers in NSW vaccinated. But health ministers don’t always get their way immediately. I have initiated discussions with the unions. I’ve spoken to two union leaders this morning. And indicated that I believe that if you want to work inside a health facility, if you want to care for patients, you should be vaccinated, because this particular virus is extremely dangerous. And there are precedents for compulsory, or mandatorily required vaccines in other areas, so I’ve asked NSW Health to work with the unions. As I said, I’ve picked up the phone and spoken to them as well and I’m hopeful we might be able to get to a point where we might get to a consensus view. My strong view is that health workers, they go into the business of looking after people because they care about them. And I think that the majority of people in Health will get vaccinated. Obviously, there have been some constraints about the vaccine supply. But most of them are on board. But even a small number is concerning and we’ve seen some situations where, obviously, negative consequences have occurred and we’re here to look after people and patients and hopefully that’s what all health workers want to do. What is the hold-up with aged care staff vaccinations in NSW? The federal government says no state, including NSW, has put a public health order out to mandate vaccines for aged care staff. Brad Hazzard drops a bucket on the federal government: The federal government is responsible for aged care. And if they want to ask me to put in place an order for that, I will. And I may also look at it. But can I tell you – the issue is, at the same time, there’s a lot of discussion going on in the community about mandatory vaccinations, and I think that needs to be sorted through. Certainly in terms of the federal government. They need to make sure that the area they regulate is actually getting what is needed and they need to make sure that the vaccines are getting to them as well. We’ve had to step up. The NSW government has stepped up to help the federal government in getting vaccinations for aged care workers. You might recollect that, originally, the federal government said that they would address all of that and they vaccinated a number of residents in aged care. They didn’t vaccinate the staff and I guess that was a supply issue, but I’m not sure why they didn’t, when they had people on deck at the aged care facilities. And I understand they’ve now agreed across-the-board that they will do whatever they can to try to get staff in the aged care facilities vaccinated with the first dose by the middle of September. And we are certainly supporting that. If any of the aged care workers, we’ve made it clear, any of the aged care workers who want to come to our hubs, we will vaccinate them. So we’re doing everything we can to assist them, and if at some stage, it moves to the point where we have to put an order in place, and that’s something that the federal government wants to do, we’ll do it. But that’s well off to mid-September. If they can tell us now and gave us that direction, I’d happily do it. But it’s their facility, their regulation and they’re responsible. Brad Hazzard on the existing health orders: We have been on this journey in NSW for 20 months. Delta is an extremely dangerous variant. It is wreaking havoc across the world. In NSW it is people within a small element, a small group who have caused these problems, if they would just behave themselves and have an element of decency towards the rest of the community, we would sort this problem out. The laws are there. Comply with them and we will get through this. Brad Hazzard is doing a lot of commenting here for someone who isn’t commenting: I’m conscious that when police are investigating, we should allow them to take their investigations and not prejudice those investigations. Hopefully, any activity that might have been inappropriate or illegal will be dealt with by the police and courts. I’m not prepared to comment except to say that every individual should comply with Health. When Health ask you questions, it is to try to save you and your family and friends and your community. The answer is, be very open with them. As to police, if the police come after you, it is for a reason generally. Brad Hazzard is asked about the Byron Bay case: All I am prepared to say about our traveller to Byron is the police are looking extremely closely what he was doing in that area. I trust the police will be able to take appropriate action in due course. There are matters where one has to be a bit cautious because I’m not going to prejudice part of the police investigations or the police actions. I am certainly hopeful there will be both. Pushed on the issue, Hazzard says: I’ve said all I prepared to say. You can draw your conclusions but the premier has said we have the strictest of orders in NSW. If people start with what they are asked to do, this Delta virus would be finding itself being beaten back into submission. The fact that people are ignoring the rules and, I have to say, I’m being fair, probably something in order of 95%, a high percentage of people are complying. You see that in Fairfield, who have made such a difference and what the numbers down to such a low level. I thank the people of Fairfield. There are other communities and people from other backgrounds who don’t seem to think that it is necessary to comply with the law and who don’t really give great consideration to what they do in terms of its impact on the rest of the community. I do say to them, you need to because otherwise the forces of the law are coming after you. Asked about rules which still allow people to travel to look at real estate, or to travel between second homes, Brad Hazzard is asked whether there are any moves to change those rules. Hazzard: The issue is that it is difficult in regards to houses in different areas but examples would be if you had a doctor who lived in Sydney but also went to somewhere in the regions for three days a week, for five days a week. If you had another house there, if you had a family split up and one partner wanted to move and look at a house to find accommodation to take their children or his children. It is challenging. Having said that, I asked the legal department to look at what we can do to tighten it up as far as possible. Clearly, the rules now are that you shouldn’t just travel from house to another for the sake of moving to the other house. Choose the property you are living in and stay there. What worries me is no matter what legal orders or requirements are in place, you can’t legislate against stupidity, arrogance and entitlement. People will still try and do it, which is why the premier has made the point that we have asked in the epicentre at the moment of this virus that is at Canterbury-Bankstown for the police to reinforce the existing rules. If people applied the rules, if they complied with the rules and law and applied an element of common sense and modicum of decency to the rest of the committee, we would be fine. Asked about opening up, given that children can’t get vaccinated, Gladys Berejiklian says: The NSW government never has and never would take decisions which would impact the safety of our citizens. We are always speaking about the safety of our community but, having said that, higher risks of vaccination among adults gives you the opportunity to do things differently in September and October. We are looking forward to so we aren’t making decisions that aren’t going to keep our community safe. The reason why we have a strategy to vaccinate year 12 students in those LGAs of concern is to ensure they can safely sit their exams and HSC requirement. I’m using that as an example. To year 12 students, please know that you will be able to sit for your exams and attain your HSC and, more broadly, when it comes, decisions around school and education in young people, we will follow and take health advice as we always have. But we also know that in particular demographics and populations ... we will never compromise the safety of our citizens. We have to be upfront about vaccines being a key tool. Anyone who thinks it isn’t a key tool in dealing with Delta, listen to the facts. They aren’t listening to health advice. It is very important for us to make all our decisions based on health advice and the facts and populations need moving forward. Asked whether the NSW government would put harsher restrictions on areas of concern (currently Canterbury-Bankstown) Gladys Berejiklian says: I ask people to look at the facts as to how harsh the lockdown is in those LGAs. For example, other states have an authorised workers list going to 17 pages. The list for those eight or nine LGAs is very short compared to what other states had but the different point is the Delta. When you have a virus that is not contagious and when you have an unvaccinated population, that is the threat of Delta. Strong suppression in our state of works in that we don’t have hundreds of thousands of cases and deaths. We managed to avoid those but Delta is different. We need to treat it differently and the NSW government doesn’t have any intention of putting any strategies that aren’t going to work. We need is to ensure we have greater compliance and the police know and are providing us advice, working with the ADF on a daily basis to ensure compliance. Day-to-day we get updates on what those compliance activities demonstrate. We also have to accept that when you are allowing critical workers, and aged care or providing food services, venturing out of those committees with high rates of transmission, you need those high rates of testing and high rates of vaccine. That is why we are keen to provide any incentives we can to people in those communities to get their vaccine. It was a great joy yesterday in what has been a very difficult couple of weeks and will be for the next few weeks a great joy to see HSC students come forward and get the vaccine. The other of the strategies in those LGAs is to continue to adapt to ensure we reduce the spread and make sure we reduce the chance, rate of people being hospitalised. Has the NSW government given up on reaching zero cases, and is just relying on vaccinations? Gladys Berejiklian: The NSW government has always said that our strategy is to get to as close to zero as we can to those cases infectious in the community but regrettably we have seen those numbers increase in the last few days. It is always the binding principle which national cabinet has to follow. However, we have said NSW, as I’ve said continuously, at higher vaccination rates will give us additional freedoms. There is no doubt about that because what we need to prevent is people ending up in hospital. One positive aspect of the last few weeks is confirmation that vaccination prevents people ending up in hospital. It reduces the spread so a targeted vaccine strategy and those LGAs of concern is key to us moving forward in NSW. It is clear to us having greater freedom and key to us making sure we get those vaccination targets. Getting to 6 million jabs by the end of August will give us some chances in September and we are looking forward to that. We are taking advice from a health experts and others across government to see what September and October look like. Let me assure you that NSW strongly supports was in the Doherty report. That is having all states abiding by the code which says you have strong suppression studies in place until you get to 70% double doses. That is certainly our strategy. Gladys Berejiklian on that same point: If the health advice said to us there was further we need to do, we would do it. We have to accept that part of the challenge we have in NSW is because of lack of compliance, and part of the challenge is because Delta is very different to anything we have seen before. Part of the challenge is having people accept, a small handful of people, accept this is serious. There are still pockets of people who think this isn’t a serious illness, unfortunately, who don’t believe the need to follow health orders and that impacts everybody but, moreover than anything else, it is the way this virus spreads and the way the virus moves. I assure you that short of not having authorised workers do what is necessary, it is really difficult us to get to lower case numbers without that targeted vaccine strategy. The first question is when will there be more compliance measures – a “ring of steel” (which is just, as has been pointed out, a nice way of saying police and the army around Sydney stopping people from leaving) and curfews (which the Victorian response admitted was to help police the restrictions, not part of the health advice itself). Gladys Berejiklian says the Delta variant needs a different response: What we also have to accept is the basic fact that Delta is very different to other strains we have had. Policy positions that may have worked in the past aren’t going to have effect with Delta. It is something we need to accept. Except this is a different variant and we need to approach it differently. I’ll finish my sentence. In relation to that point, based on the health expert advice, vaccination reduces your chance of spreading, reduces your chance of laying in hospital and reduces your chance of dying. That is why a targeted approach in those local government areas with our vaccine strategies is a key to see us maintain and reduce those case numbers. Please know that had we not been in this difficult lockdown for six or seven weeks, the case numbers would undoubtedly have been in their thousands and thousands every day. That is no doubt. There is also no doubt that the Delta strain is different to other types of Covid have had in Australia. Your approach has to be different. Gladys Berejiklian says NSW will “always consider options” which will reduce case numbers. She means police enforcement, because she then goes to deputy police commissioner Gary Worboys for an update. Worboys: The last 24 hours over 1,000 compliance checks in that south-west LGA area of concern with police and ADF. It was yesterday that they found two people who were meant to be inside a house that weren’t there. They were located and health are advised they were returned to where they should be. These compliance checks are working and having an impact ... In the north of the state in the last 24 hours, over 400 vehicles were stopped by police specifically for those breaches that might be occurring in and around public health orders and people travelling without a reasonable excuse. Seventeen infringement notices were issued and seven vehicles were turned around and sent back to locations where they came from because they had no reasonable excuse. It is a challenging time for the community and police but NSW police won’t back down in their endeavour to ensure people comply with the public health orders across the state. Particular emphasis in those eight LGAs, those nine LGAs and into the Canterbury-Bankstown area, but let’s be clear that right across the state there are now risks and threats with people reaching public health orders and the police have specific operations at each of the areas to ensure people comply and put us in a position where we can best get through this challenging time. There has been a confirmed case at an aged care centre, Dr Kerry Chant says: We have had a confirmed case at the St George aged care centre in Bexley. A confirmed case in a staff member who worked one shift while infectious on one level at the facility. Four out of eight residents have tested positive. All eight of the residents were vaccinated. The staff member received their first dose of vaccination. Appropriate care is being provided. The message now, Dr Kerry Chant says, is if you are heading out in an affected LGA in Sydney, you could be coming into contact with the virus: We are seeing people infectious in the community so the clear message is, every time you leave home assume you are coming into contact with someone with Covid-19. Chant also gives an update on the Liverpool hospital: As part of that Liverpool hospital outbreak we had seven staff and a student nurse and 29 patients impacted. There have been six deaths with this outbreak. NSW Health and the staff at Liverpool hospital extend their sincere sympathies to their families and friends of these patients. The death of any patient is felt deeply by the healthcare professionals who care for them and a situation like this is tragic for everyone. The exposures occurred on a geriatric and neurology ward and these patients were receiving the best possible care but sadly many are older and have health conditions which leave them very vulnerable to the harmful effects of Covid. Staff at Liverpool hospital are providing care and support for these patients in extremely difficult circumstances. The hospital is one of the busiest in the state. Gladys Berejiklian makes another plea for vaccinations: As always, it is so sad when you hear about deaths, especially from elderly people who unfortunately, for whatever reason, weren’t vaccinated because that is proving to be an ongoing challenge. Those who have had two doses of vaccination have so far avoided any ICU, mortality. Unfortunately those that are unvaccinated of any age, of any age, continue to be vulnerable. With case numbers where they are, unfortunately, if you live in those LGAs of concern, there is a high chance you could get the virus. Protect yourself, your family and loved ones and community by getting vaccinated. Through your GP, pharmacist, whatever NSW Health clinics, whether through your local place of worship or community centre if there is a vaccine hub near you, come forward and get vaccinated. It is the type to protect yourself and family and loved ones and I issue a plea [that] if you want to get back to work and back to normal life, please get your vaccine. It is clear to what we can do potentially in September and October. Here is how the data is looking: The Canterbury-Bankstown area is still the main area of concern. Gladys Berejiklian: Canterbury-Bankstown remains the central area where Covid-19 cases are increasing and we have seen stabilisation and substantial decline in areas like Fairfield so communities that are responding to health orders and to what we are asking them to do are seeing a decline in their LGAs. There are no additional cases in Armidale or Tamworth and the north coast is investigating one potential additional case but that isn’t linked to the gentleman in Byron Bay. Armidale and Tamworth have no additional cases and potentially one north coast, not related to the gentleman in Byron. Hunter has continued to have additional cases. NSW authorities know that just 102 or the new cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period. There have been three more deaths reported as part of this outbreak. None of the three were vaccinated and all were in hospitals. A returned traveller from overseas has also died. As expected, both NSW and Victoria will hold their press conferences at 11am. We’ll bring you NSW first, given we are still waiting on those numbers (with the headlines from Victoria, but will have it all covered off. Victoria has recorded 20 new cases – only five were in isolation for their infectious period, but all cases have been linked. At this point, it is looking unlikely the lockdown will lift at the end of the scheduled seven days but, as we know – nothing is known, until it is actually known. Good news for Queensland. Three new community cases – all linked, and none were in the community while infectious. More than 13,000 people remain in home quarantine. Contact tracing in Cairns is going back to 23 July. Cairns has reported no new cases. Police enforcement at the border is increasing in response to the NSW northern rivers lockdown. If anyone in Queensland has been in one of those affected northern rivers LGAs since 31 July, they are required to go into the same lockdown restrictions as NSW has ordered (stay at home). A new $70m package has been announced to support tourism and hospitality businesses. Annastacia Palaszczuk has denied focus-group testing influenced her pandemic response decisions. And before the “aren’t spray cans bad for the environment” message takes hold – Australia ceased its use of CFC propellants in cans before 1989. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the focus group didn’t guide her decision making: It can ask that. That won’t guide my decision-making. It won’t guide my decision-making. Guide my decision-making? This wonderful woman to the left of me [Dr Jeannette Young] has helped keep Queenslanders safe. ...Every state and territory including the Federal Government would have invested money into sentiment testing and into some research. It would be absolutely negligent not to do that. ...You know clearly everyone was yelling at me to open the borders. Don’t talk to me about popularity. Everyone was attacking me when I stood my ground here and backed in the Chief Health Officer’s advice to me when it was seen as being not popular out there in the public and it kept Queenslanders safe. and it kept Queenslanders safe. Palaszczuk says she hasn’t seen all the polling, but won’t go into what parts she has seen: I’m not going into all of that today. That’s ridiculous. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is being questioned over a report in the Australian newspaper that the Queensland government has been focus-testing its pandemic response. (The federal government has also engaged focus groups for its pandemic response.) Palaszczuk says it’s normal: The research was done to help the advertising campaigns that the Covid-19 taskforce put in place. Everyone knows clearly how much I was personally attacked and the government was personally attacked for some of the strongest answers that we took taking on advice. Dr Young’s clear advice about the health. There has been high court cases that have backed our decision-making and it is interesting to see that when we were one of the first to come out and do these hard and fast lockdowns, it has now become the mantra of nearly every other state and territory, including the federal government. Q: According to the documents, your department has offered it, it isn’t about messaging or advertising. It says, quote, “this research will help guide the decision-making and communications approach around the lifting of restrictions”. Palaszczuk: [Not] the decision-making. That is not correct. I reject that. Q: It also says there are 17 waves of research that are coming in and again it shows that it is about guiding your decision-making. Palaszczuk: But is not correct. You’ll find that nearly every state including the federal government from time to time does sentiment testing and research especially to guide their advertising campaigns. Those campaigns have to be based on value for money and making sure there is clear messaging to the public what are do with the Covid-19 and social distancing and staying at home, these are important messaging that needs to happen. There was talk about this yesterday. Labor was saying it was open to changing the parliamentary calendar but was only approached by the government late last week, after hotel bookings and arrangements had already been made. It’s also worth noting that the government has the numbers on the floor – and can make any changes to the sitting calendar, for the House, that it wants – because it has the numbers. For the record, the change which was being discussed was going straight into the third week of sittings (removing the week break) and then dropping off the fourth week of sittings (so three weeks instead of four, but no break). Queensland treasurer Cameron Dick (Milton’s brother, for federal watchers) has announced a new support package for tourism and hospitality businesses: We are waiving, refunding or deferring a range of fees and charges across government for eligible tourism hospitality business across the state for 12 months so for this financially until 30 June 2022. There are a range of fees and charges which will be refunded or waived. We are awaiting or refunding all the licensing fees for tourism and hospitality businesses for this financial year, a benefit of around $22m for business and industry in the tourism and hospitality space. The extent of $5,000 business support grants to all large tourism and hospitality businesses across Queensland. The government is setting aside $20m for a Covid cleaning rebate. It will pay 80% of small and medium sized businesses cleaning costs if they are a Covid exposed site up to a maximum of $10,000. We hope that will help businesses who may become Covid exposed sites. Panic buying has hit far north Queensland, deputy premier Steven Miles says: We are aware of some shortage of product lines in supermarkets in and around Cairns. These aren’t caused by a shortage of products in the state but panic buying. Supermarkets will deploy additional products to those stores but it is important to underline to people in Cairns that they will not run out of goods. Only buy what you need and only shop alone if you can, not in groups. Please be kind to our essential workers. On the Byron case, if you were in Byron since 31 July and are now in Queensland, you have to isolate. Dr Jeannette Young: It is really important that anyone in Queensland who has been any of those for local government areas since or on 31 July, when the man drove up from Sydney to Byron Bay while infectious, that you now are bound by those same requirements that NSW has put in place. Anyone who has been in those four LGAs and have gotten anywhere else out of those four LGAs, whether in NSW or Queensland or anywhere else, now needs to stay at home except for those for reasons that we are all used to. It is really important because he was infectious in the community from 31 July. It has been confirmed that he never travelled into his land. He travelled from Sydney to Byron Bay on 31 July and never travelled into Queensland. That is good. It is reassuring but having said that, anyone who has been in those four LGAs while he was there needs to now stay-at-home except those essential reasons. In terms of the Cairns alert, CHO Dr Jeannette Young says they are going back to 23 July: You might remember that that marine pilot developed symptoms on 31 July, meaning he had an infectious period from 29 July two days before but he was fully vaccinated, and we know that can change whether or not someone gets any symptoms at all. We now have this information from New Zealand about the ship that he piloted, coming off that on 23 July and everything that is probably where he acquired it. We will have to go back and contact traced to 23 July. The taxi driver then took the pilot to the airport on 26 July and we know through whole genome sequencing that those two are linked but that was before we thought he was infectious which is why he wasn’t up on contact tracing but we are now going back further. People in Cairns, there will be venues put up there and please just take note because you might have been in one of those venues going back to that 23 July. That is really important. Given the northern rivers lockdown in NSW, Queensland will increase its police presence on the border. Annastacia Palaszczuk says there are only three cases in Queensland today, all linked, and all in home quarantine. A total of 20,484 tests have been completed. In Cairns, there were more than 4,400 tests (it’s in lockdown at the moment) There are 155 active cases. 13,271 people are in home quarantine. 11,000 people have received their vaccinations in the last 24 hours. More than 50,000 people have registered for the mass vaccination hub. If you are wondering where all the MPs are – it’s party room meeting day, which means they are all having their group chats. I mean, it’s not like they are trying to hide it The Extinction Rebellion protesters, who held a protest outside Parliament House, moved on to The Lodge (it is just down the road) where they spray-painted the same message, “duty of care”, onto the wall that separates the residence from the public. It looks like the AFP have now turned up. Queensland will give its update at 10am (Cairns is still in lockdown). We’re expecting NSW and Victoria to both be around 11am. We’ll bring you all the information as soon as we get it. There is a climate protest out the front of Parliament House following the IPCC report. A pram has also been set on fire. Meanwhile, in the United States (via AAP): Members of the US military will be required to get the Covid-19 vaccine beginning next month under a plan laid out by the Pentagon and endorsed by President Joe Biden. In memos distributed to all troops on Monday, top Pentagon leaders said the vaccine is a necessary step to maintain military readiness. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the mid-September deadline could be accelerated if the vaccine receives final FDA approval or infection rates continue to rise. “I will seek the president’s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon” licensure by the Food and Drug Administration “whichever comes first”, Austin said in his memo, warning them to prepare for the requirement. The Pentagon plan provides time for the FDA to give final approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which is expected early next month. Without that formal approval, Austin needs a waiver from Biden to make the shots mandatory, and Biden has already made clear he supports it. Austin’s decision reflects similar moves by governments and companies around the world, as nations struggle with the highly contagious delta variant that has sent new US cases, hospitalisations and deaths surging to heights not seen since last winter. The concerns are especially acute in the military, where service members live and work closely together in barracks and on ships, increasing the risks of rapid spreading. Any large virus outbreak in the military could affect America’s ability to defend itself in any security crisis. Austin warned that if infection rates rise and potentially affect military readiness, “I will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the president if l feel the need to do so. To defend this nation, we need a healthy and ready force.” In a statement on Monday, Biden said he strongly supports Austin’s message to the force and the plan to add the Covid vaccine “to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September”. Biden said the country is still on a wartime footing and “being vaccinated will enable our service members to stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our force is ready to operate anywhere in the world.” The US is averaging about 108,000 new infections and 700,000 vaccines administered a day. Josh Nicholas and the data team have updated the Victorian charts: Still on Josh Frydenberg, he was asked whether, with lockdowns extending, Australia was headed for recession and said: The September quarter is likely to be negative where the economy will contract, as a function of seeing our big states in lockdown. Frydenberg says there is “light at the end of the tunnel” though. Yesterday, Scott Morrison said the government wouldn’t indemnify employers who mandate the vaccine because that would be an endorsement of mandatory vaccines. Greg Hunt, though, said employers were already indemnified because it was a commonwealth sponsored vaccine. So, clear as mud there. Josh Frydenberg was sent out this morning to explain why the government won’t be making the Covid vaccination mandatory, and why it won’t be helping businesses which decide to make it mandatory for its employees. Here he is on the Seven Network this morning: We have a broad principle that the vaccines are both free but also voluntary. There are exceptions with respect to workers in aged care, as well as in quarantine. Whether an employer can make a reasonable direction to the employees to receive the vaccine will depend on the individual circumstances in that case. Safe Work Australia and the fair work ombudsman have provided information and guidelines, and it will depend on whether the employees in that business, public facing, whether they are dealing with vulnerable cohorts of workers, or people, customers who may come into get the Covid virus, or indeed other relevant factors. Pressed on that, with this question: I can’t visit my mate at a nursing home unless I have a flu shot. Can I sue the nursing home for being discriminatory? When we went to Rio for the last Olympics, you made me have a yellow fever injection and would let me back in unless I had one. Can I sue you? What if I get sick from my colleague here that is unvaccinated, can I sue my employer? This is stupid. You’ve got to give clear guidelines to say that people should be vaccinated. It’s a health emergency. Frydenberg says: It will depend upon the individual circumstances. Host: That’s too wishy-washy. Frydenberg: If you look at the guidelines, it made it very clear that it does depend on the situation. If you’ve got dealing with vulnerable cohorts of people and your employees are public facing or a range of other factors that are at play, that will go to whether it’s reasonable for an employer to make the call. Michael Sukkar says around 3.3 million Australian households have already completed their census. The official deadline is tonight. All 20 are linked, and five were in isolation for their infectious period: Moderna received provisional approval from the TGA yesterday, although it has been used successfully across the world for quite some time. Part of the reason Australia was late to the Moderna vaccine party was because the agreement wasn’t signed until May this year. As Jim Chalmers told the Seven Network: Well, let’s talk about Moderna. I mean, most countries had Moderna if not last year then certainly the early months of this year. These Moderna vaccines for Australia were announced in May, we’re now approaching the middle of August. I think the prime minister sees this as a political race rather than a public health race. That’s why we see all this kind of faux urgency now from the prime minister. The rest of us have known for a long time now that this all hinges on vaccine rollout. He was slow off the mark, said it wasn’t a race, made all kinds of excuses, but Australians are paying the price for those failures now. We’re seeing that in NSW, we’ve seen it in other parts of the country at different times. Until we get on top of that, until the prime minister fixes the mess that he’s made with this vaccine rollout, then more people will suffer for longer. Labor’s Jim Chalmers, a Queenslander, had some advice for NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian while talking to the Seven Network this morning. But he made sure to keep the message (that the Morrison government has to take ultimate responsibility) on track: I think we’ve got to get the cases down obviously, it’s been devastating for the whole country to watch these New South Wales cases in their hundreds. I think this is a reminder that the sorts of things that Premier Berejiklian is contemplating, this is a reminder that decisions taken in any part of Australia have consequences for other parts of Australia. But it all comes back, in one way or another, to getting the vaccine rollout right and building that purpose-built quarantine. Until or unless we can do that, and those are federal government responsibilities, then we’ll continue to have this kind of patchwork quilt of different arrangements in different parts of Australia, and all the damage that that does to the national economy. Just how much of NSW’s population are under lockdown? Most of it, reports AAP: More than 80 per cent of the NSW population is now in lockdown as the state struggles to curb the spread of the Delta Covid-19 strain beyond Greater Sydney and into the regions. About 6,571,800 residents have now been placed into lockdown. Byron Bay and surrounding local government areas in northern NSW entered a snap seven-day lockdown from 6pm on Monday after a man from Sydney travelled there about a week ago and subsequently tested positive to Covid-19. Byron Shire mayor Michael Lyon said locals feared an outbreak and there was no record of venues the man had visited. “What we do know is he hadn’t been checking in anywhere, hasn’t used QR codes, hasn’t been self-isolating when he got sick, he didn’t get tested until he was really sick,” he told ABC radio on Tuesday. The lockdown came as the regional city of Tamworth also joined the Hunter region and Armidale in a seven-day lockdown after an infected young woman visited the area from Newcastle. Meanwhile, Sydney’s Bondi Beach Public School and Shortland Public School in Newcastle are closed for cleaning on Tuesday after Covid cases there, while Kingswood Public School in Sydney’s west and Armidale Secondary College in the New England region have reopened after cases of the virus there. Meanwhile the ABC reports another apartment block in Sydney’s west has been put into lockdown. Residents in the 58 units in the Astina apartments in Penrith are all considered close contacts after the building was listed by NSW Health as an exposure site for three days last week with residents and visitors needing to get tested and isolate for 14 days. In the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday NSW recorded 283 local Covid-19 cases, 106 of which were in the community while infectious. The Coalition’s ideological block against acting on climate in Australia is not conservatism – Boris Johnson is a conservative, Angela Merkel is a conservative, and yet both are pushing for action. Mostly because it makes economic sense – it is where the markets, and the money is going. In Australia, though, we are held hostage by a handful of people in a party room, representing must-win electorates, so we keep hearing the same fairy tales, without the much-needed dose of reality. It is possible to transition our energy needs, there are jobs on the other side, and new industries offer new alternatives for livelihoods as well as offering hope for the future – that hope being that we can contain the planet’s warming to 1.5 degrees. Both Angus Taylor and Sussan Ley (most recently in the news for lobbying countries to remove the Great Barrier Reef’s draft in-danger listing) on ABC News Breakfast this morning. They will speak on it though – in dixers in parliament, where they can talk about just how much Australia is doing (which is not anywhere near enough) and how it will be technology not taxes which gets Australia to wherever it is we are apparently going (no one is suggesting taxes, because it is not 2012, despite the Coalition attempting to prosecute the same battles). In case you haven’t already, remember to fill out your census form tonight. Even if it doesn’t really count everybody because, once again, the culture wars rule everything in Australia. As Josh Taylor reports: As millions of households fill out their 2021 census across the country on Tuesday, the two questions unsurprisingly causing the most controversy are about a person’s religion and sex, a demographer says. Ahead of the official census date on Tuesday, 2.3m of the 10m households across Australia had already filled out their forms, after the Australian Bureau of Statistics allowed people to complete the questionnaire ahead of time. The early access to the census has drawn focus on some of the questions, as well as questions some believe are missing. We’ve all made it through another day to land on Tuesday, where the parties will hold their meetings and the Coalition will tell us how it’s doing the mostest on climate, despite the IPCC report. It’s that sort of day. You can feel it. But while we’re on eyebrow raising topics, there is this story from Luke Henriques-Gomes that I hope everyone gets a chance to read today: The federal government has sent more than 11,000 people Centrelink debt letters worth a total of $32m claiming they were overpaid due to jobkeeper, while resisting calls to claw back money from businesses who got the wage subsidy and then made a profit. Services Australia has told senate estimates 11,771 people have had a debt raised “after the completion of a review of their income support payments and the jobkeeper income that was paid to them by their employer”. So a day after the government fought (and won) a change from the Senate to stop businesses who received jobkeeper and didn’t need it (as well as how much they paid) from becoming public, we learn that the government is chasing employees of businesses which received jobkeeper for debts. But the businesses are fine, even if they used the funds for dividends and bonuses, which we know some of them did. Meanwhile, NSW is still struggling to keep a lid on its Covid outbreak, with large parts of the regions now in lockdown. The Hunter and upper Hunter, Tamworth, Armidale and now the northern rivers, which includes Byron Bay, have been locked down after Covid cases were discovered. Gladys Berejiklian is concentrating on vaccination as the way out, with the lockdown not seemingly focused on getting to zero cases, but instead acting as a speed hump for infections. But the rest of the states seem inclined to keep NSW cordoned off until the nation reaches the 70% to 80% vaccination target, if Australia’s largest state keeps seeing case numbers in the hundreds, while continuing to spread beyond Sydney. We’ll bring you all the updates, both political and covid, as the day rolls on.

But the backlash has been swift in Israel. The furore proves an interesting backdrop for a special report led by our Jerusalem correspondent, Oliver Holmes, on the state of peace in Israel and Palestine a year after the beginning of protests at the Gaza/Israel border, which have seen more than 180 people die. We travel to Gaza, where ordinary young people – unable to expand their horizons beyond the 40km strip – have found their lives on pause due to Israel and Egypt’s blockade of the territory. Then, in Israel, we meet the peace protesters who are finding their once-mainstream movement diminished by a political system that has lurched to the right. This week’s other big international stories include the blackout in Venezuela and England and Wales’s problems with knife crime. But our Spotlight section opens this week with a report by our Tokyo correspondent Justin McCurry, who has travelled to Japan’s Fukushima prefecture to meet families living in the area affected by the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011. There, he finds brand new schools with hardly any people – and hardy farmers unwilling to let businesses that have been in their families for decades be destroyed by the disaster. Is the car really essential for most people? That’s the question asked by George Monbiot. Many of us live in built environments designed explicitly for driving – but cars are a key contributor to carbon emissions, air pollution and pedestrian deaths. With urgent action required on all those issues, should governments and individuals cut the use of cars by 90% over the next decade?

The statement from the foreign ministry said Russia has “fully and strictly observed the sanctions regime”. It came in response to a Reuters report citing two separate, unidentified western European security sources who said ship-to-ship transfers took place in October and November and represented a breach of sanctions. The statement did not address whether the ships had transferred the fuel. It did however say resolutions by the UN security council had imposed limits on North Korea’s refined oil imports but had not banned them altogether. On Saturday, North Korea announced it would continue to enhance its nuclear capabilities, with state media declaring the Communist state an “invincible” and “responsible” nuclear power. “Do not expect any change in its policy. Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. “The US persistently moves against the DPRK in political, economic, military, diplomatic and all other fields till the end of this year could not stop even a moment the advance of the DPRK confident in the victory of its cause.” The security council has unanimously approved several rounds of sanctions against North Korea over its missile tests and nuclear program, including a tough resolution earlier this month. The resolution included sharply reduced limits on North Korea’s refined oil imports, the return home of all North Koreans working overseas within 24 months, and a crackdown on ships smuggling banned items including coal and oil to and from the country. It didn’t include even harsher measures sought by the US that would ban all oil imports and freeze the international assets of the government and its leader, Kim Jong-un. The two security sources quoted by Reuters cited naval intelligence and satellite imagery of the vessels operating out of Russian far eastern ports on the Pacific but declined to disclose further details. Ship satellite positioning data consulted by Reuters and available on Reuters Eikon reportedly showed unusual movements and behaviour by some of the Russian vessels named by the security sources including switching off the transponders which give a precise location. The security sources said the Russian-flagged tanker Vityaz was one vessel that had transferred fuel to North Korean vessels. Yaroslav Guk, deputy director of the tanker’s owner, Vladivostok-based Alisa Ltd, denied the vessel had had contact with North Korean vessels. “Absolutely no, this is very dangerous,” he said. “It would be complete madness.” One of the sources said there was nothing to suggest Russian state involvement in the latest transfers. “There is no evidence that this is backed by the Russian state but these Russian vessels are giving a lifeline to the North Koreans,” the source said. The Russian Customs Service declined to comment when asked on Wednesday if Russian ships had supplied fuel to North Korean vessels. The latest report follows China’s rejection of claims by Donald Trump that it had illicitly shipped oil products to North Korea. On Thursday the US president said Beijing had been “caught red-handed” and that he was “very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea”. Such moves would prevent “a friendly solution” to the crisis over Pyongyang’s nuclear program, he said. North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. It also requires oil for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear programme that the US says threatens the peace in Asia. Four ships – three North Korean vessels and a Palau-flagged oil tanker – were blocked from international ports by the security council on Thursday on suspicion of carrying or transporting goods banned by sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s weapons ambitions. In November, South Korea detained the crew of a Hong Kong-registered tanker and impounded the vessel for transferring oil to a North Korean vessel and breaching UN sanctions, Seoul’s customs officials said on Saturday. The Lighthouse Winmore, which was chartered by a Taiwanese company, was seized by South Korean customs authorities at the port of Yeosu on 24 November following an inspection. “Since then, inspectors have been coming on board and questioning the crew”, a Korea Customs Service official told AFP. The Lighthouse Winmore has 25 crew, comprising 23 mainland Chinese citizens and two Myanmar nationals, another customs official at Yeosu said. The tanker, chartered by Taiwanese company Billions Bunker Group Corp., previously visited Yeosu on 11 October and took on board 14,000 tonnes of Japanese refined oil before heading towards its purported destination in Taiwan. Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred 600 tonnes of oil to the North’s Sam Jong 2 in international waters off China before returning to Yeosu, the customs officials said. Taiwan’s transport ministry said it was investigating whether any Taiwanese entities were involved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2019/jun/21/zero-carbon-energy-overtakes-fossil-fuels-as-the-uks-largest-electricity-source","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-20T23:01:27Z","webTitle":"Fossil fuels produce less than half of UK electricity for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/zero-carbon-energy-overtakes-fossil-fuels-as-the-uks-largest-electricity-source","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/jun/21/zero-carbon-energy-overtakes-fossil-fuels-as-the-uks-largest-electricity-source","fields":{"headline":"Fossil fuels produce less than half of UK electricity for first time","bodyText":"Zero-carbon energy sources are poised to overtake fossil fuels as the UK’s largest electricity source over a full calendar year. This year will be the first that fossil fuels make up less than half of the electricity generated, according to National Grid, following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and rising renewable and low-carbon energy. Instead, UK homes and businesses will rely more on “cleaner” electricity generated by wind farms, solar panels, hydro power and nuclear power reactors. A decade ago, coal plants generated almost a third of the UK’s electricity, but in the first half of this year they have provided only 3%. In the same period renewable energy has climbed from supplying just 2% of the UK’s power to a fifth of all electricity produced. The “landmark tipping point” is an “historic achievement” in the UK’s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, said National Grid. John Pettigrew, the UK power system operator’s chief executive, said: “The incredible progress that Britain has made in the past 10 years means we can now say 2019 will be the year zero-carbon power beats fossil fuel-fired generation for the first time.” “We wouldn’t have said it if we weren’t confident that this will be the year.” National Grid is able to confidently predict the 2019 record only six months into the year following the UK’s greenest ever winter, and the huge number of coal-free days recorded since then. The UK reached a record stretch of consecutive 18 coal-free days earlier this year, which ended on 4 June. The electricity system reached a second record this week after racking up 1,838 coal-free hours for this year, breaking a record set across the whole of 2018 in a little over six months. The coal-free days have effectively prevented 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of over 12bn miles driven in a car. Chris Skidmore MP, the interim energy minister, said coal is “fast becoming the fossil of our energy system and it will soon be consigned to the history books”. He added: “We’ve set in stone our commitment to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050 and this is yet another step on the path to becoming a net zero emissions economy.” By the end of the winter the UK will be left with only five remaining coal fired power plants, after SSE said last week it plans to shut its Fiddler’s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, next March. SSE revealed the closure after EDF Energy said it would shut its Cottam coal plant in September. The government plans to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2025. National Grid is spending around £1.3bn a year to adapt the grid to run on renewable energy, and believes that it will be ready to manage a completely zero-carbon electricity grid within six years. “Do I expect that this will be a reality? No,” Pettigrew said. “But we won’t be a constraint in a low carbon world. We will be prepared to play our role.” Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said the “watershed moment” is a sign that the UK is “broadly heading in the right direction”. “The question is, are we moving fast enough?” he said. Research undertaken by National Grid alongside its record forecast has found that “climate anxiety” is rising because people believe there is a lack of urgency in tackling the climate crisis. Nearly seven out of 10 people surveyed by National Grid are concerned about climate change and believe it is not being addressed urgently enough. More than a third of young people said their concerns about climate change would drive them to join a protest. Almost a fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds said they are prepared to skip school or work to do this, possibly inspired by student activist Greta Thurnberg who visited the UK earlier this summer. “As the climate emergency hits home right across the globe from Greenland’s melting ice to India’s scorching heatwave, the clock is ticking on our chances to avoid climate breakdown and public anxiety rightly remains high about the speed of change,” Parr said. “This is no time for ministers to pat themselves on the back and uncork the bubbly,” he said. • This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to clarify in the text that nuclear is not a renewable energy source, and to change the description of the non-fossil fuels that are growing in use to “cleaner”, as they are referred to by National Grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/may/22/australia-election-2022-live-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison-josh-frydenberg-teal-independents-greens-senate-peter-dutton","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-22T08:39:44Z","webTitle":"PM-elect Albanese wants to ‘change the way politics works’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/may/22/australia-election-2022-live-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison-josh-frydenberg-teal-independents-greens-senate-peter-dutton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/may/22/australia-election-2022-live-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison-josh-frydenberg-teal-independents-greens-senate-peter-dutton","fields":{"headline":"PM-elect Albanese wants to ‘change the way politics works’ – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we will leave the live blog for Sunday. We will have more election wash-up for you on Monday, as Anthony Albanese is sworn in as prime minister, and his core team is also sworn in as he gets ready to head off to the Quad meeting. Here’s where things currently stand: Labor has not quite reached a majority of seats in its own right but is edging closer to the target. Senior Liberal Simon Birmingham has delivered a scathing review of where his party went wrong in the election, stating the delay for legalising same-sex marriage and the national energy guarantee were the starting points. Outgoing treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has not yet conceded in Kooyong, stating it is still mathematically possible on postal votes. Outgoing prime minister, Scott Morrison, has tearfully addressed the Horizon church in his electorate on his last day in the top job. Leading right figures within the Liberal and National parties have claimed the Coalition was too moderate in policies. Labor MP for Griffith, Terri Butler, conceded defeat to the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather in Griffith. Liberal MP for Goldstein, Tim Wilson, conceded defeat to independent Zoe Daniel. Outgoing Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, conceded defeat to Labor’s Tania Lawrence in Hasluck. Former Labor senator Kristina Keneally conceded defeat to independent Dai Le in the seat of Fowler. Good night, and stay safe. Independent Dai Le, who is going to be the new member for Fowler, is on Sky News. She says her roots are planted in the community: “I grew up, I live there, I work there.” She says she was told that beating Labor would be “Mt Everest” but “I really wanted to fight for my community”. “I didn’t think I could take a big giant [Labor and Kristina Keneally] down.” She says voters were “insulted”, and couldn’t bring themselves to vote Labor despite being lifelong Labor voters, after Keneally was parachuted into the seat. She also paid tribute to the Vietnamese community who turned out to support her during the campaign. “It’s a grassroots movement ... that has got us to where we have got today.” She says she has yet to hear from Keneally, despite Keneally tweeting out her concession. The slackening authority of our most prominent sources of political news and analysis has been further weakened by the results of this federal election. Few election campaigns have seen the performance of news outlets so intensely monitored, and perhaps no other election outcome has exposed such a gaping disconnect between a major news supplier and voters. Nine News is reporting the soon-to-be-former prime minister Scott Morrison hosted a party at Kirribilli House tonight for friends and staff, including the PM cracking the whip, literally. Former Labor senator Kristina Keneally has conceded she will not be successful in being elected to the Sydney seat of Fowler. Keneally will lose to independent candidate Dai Le after the Labor party was criticised for parachuting Keneally into the electorate over the local favourite Tu Le. Keneally’s failure to win means incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese will need to find a new minister for home affairs. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken has released the following statement congratulating the incoming Labor government: On behalf of the United States, I congratulate Prime Minister-Elect Anthony Albanese on his victory in the May 21 Australian federal election. Australia is a vital ally, partner, and friend of the United States. For more than seven decades, our alliance has been a force for good in the world, and we look forward to the next 70 years. Together, the United States and Australia will continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder to advance security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. Briefings for the incoming government are under way. Liberal MP and Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt has conceded he has lost his seat. He said: I just want to say thank you to the people for giving me 12 incredible years serving in the House of Representatives. Not only looking after their interests and needs but being in a position to influence the national agenda as an Indigenous person, it has been a great privilege. It has been a mixture of emotions from the first day I walked in to Parliament House through those great doors, to when I walked out from the last sitting, and I have no regrets. He said there are now between seven and nine Indigenous members of parliament. And that is a shift in Australian history and I have been a part of that. A great experience. He said he was not disappointed to lose, and told his supporters not to shed tears: I want you to think about the incredible 12 years that you have helped me achieve being in the House of Representatives and being a member of the Australian parliament. That is what I want you to remember. Now this chapter closes and a new one will open. Cash denies that Scott Morrison’s “cave dwellers” comment about Western Australians staying locked out of the rest of the country had an impact on the vote. She says people were still keen to support the state premier Mark McGowan: That was not what he was saying at the time. [He] was saying there was a light at the end of the tunnel, but putting all of that aside, last night the vote was clear. Western Australians very much supported the approach of Mark McGowan. That is what they did yesterday, in fact they had a number of people on polling booths who would come up to me and say I am voting for Mark McGowan. When you’ve got people approaching you on polling booths and genuinely saying, they weren’t trying to be smart, I’d like to vote for Mark McGowan, that just shows you that in Western Australia there is still that overwhelming support for Mr McGowan as premier. She says the very anti-Clive Palmer campaign impacted the Liberal vote in WA, also. Cash declined to comment on who should lead the Liberal party next. She says her focus is on supporting those Liberal MPs who lost their seats. Cash says the Australia the Liberal government is handing over is in “good shape”: So in terms of the Australia that we hand over to Mr Albanese and the incoming Labor government, I am very, very proud of the decisions that we made. We hand over an Australia that is in good shape, that is the envy of so many other parts of the world, but ultimately, last night, democracy was in action and the choice of the Australian people was made and it was a choice that has elected an incoming Albanese Labor government. Cash said that the federal government initially attempting to intervene with Clive Palmer’s challenge to the WA hard borders had an impact on the vote last night. Even though we reversed it, meant that the Labor party was able to run an effective campaign against us, a very strong campaign, highlighting this decision, even though we reversed it and yet it certainly did have an impact on the vote last night. When asked about Curtin, she says it is a “very, very tight race” with the postals still being counted. She says there is a “structural change” in electorates in Australia, with outer suburban Labor heartland now being “aspirational voters”. Worth noting as of right now Liberals have not taken a single seat from Labor this election. Western Australian senator Michaelia Cash says the election results in WA could have been much worse for the Liberal party, given the state election result in 2021: In relation to Western Australia, I look at what happened to the Western Australian Liberal party last year at the state election. We were reduced to but two seats in the legislative assembly. Our primary vote was around 21%. There was a lot of rebuilding that we needed to do. While we had a huge swing here in Western Australia and we have lost at least four seats, we have at least commenced the rebuilding process and when I’ll look at where our primary vote landed last night and there is still a lot of counting to go in relation to postal votes, we have at least got it to around 35% so the rebuilding process has well and truly started in the Western Australian Liberal party. Penny Wong, who will be joining Anthony Albanese in Tokyo for the Quad meeting on Tuesday, says Australia must “step up and be a credible partner of choice” with south-east Asian nations. The Quad grouping – which has been elevated to leader-level talks in recent years - brings together Australia, the US, Japan and India. It is viewed warily by China, which sees it as an effort to contain its influence. The Quad agenda is expected to include international peace and security, including the situation in Ukraine, stability in the Indo-Pacific, the resilience of Pacific Island countries, North Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan - as well as the critical importance of multilateralism including the UN. Other agenda items include global health security, cooperation on infrastructure in the region, and climate change. Wong, the foreign minister-designate, says travelling to the Quad meeting in the government’s first week in office “signifies how important we believe this partnership is for our security”. In a statement issued a short time ago, she says: We will be taking new energy and much more to the table - including our commitment to act on climate change after a lost decade. Our Quad partners are counting on us to play our part to help make our region more stable, prosperous and secure. That’s why we will be taking our election commitment of a major new package on Southeast Asia to the Quad, along with our commitments on the Pacific. Labor’s policy includes the appointment of a Southeast Asia Special Envoy – a high-level roving ambassador to work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and member states to develop stronger relationships in capitals, identify areas of mutual interest and cut through bureaucratic blockages to deliver more cooperation and assistance.The party also promised a $470m increase in foreign aid to southeast Asia over four years and develop an Asean economic strategy. It also plans to set up an Office for Southeast Asia in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - to be modelled on Office of the Pacific. Wong says in her statement: We have always understood the importance of Southeast Asia. We know that while we are all very different, our countries face many shared challenges. We all need to work together to address the reshaping of the regional order, pandemic recovery - and as President Widodo [of Indonesia] said directly to our Parliament, climate change. We need to step up and be a credible partner of choice, drawing on all elements of our national power. And we need to work with key partners US, India and Japan to multiply our efforts to build a stable and prosperous region, where sovereignty is respected and the rules of the road are upheld. You may have noticed the Legalise Cannabis Australia party is doing quite well in the Senate. At the moment even better than the United Australia party, which spent over $100m on advertising this election. Here’s a few reasons why that might be: In other news, it is going to be quite cold in Victoria tonight. South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic said the Coalition must not adopt a more ambitious climate policy, claiming that would only backfire. “In many cases people we’re trying to appease the climate crowd – look what happens,” Antic told Sky News on Sunday morning. “You throw the left and the climate crowd a bone and then they just use it to crack you on the head with later on.” Echoing Donald Trump, Antic said the Liberal party had become an “elite club”, adding: The other thing I want to see from the party is a drift away from the political swamp. We have too many political staffers who become politicians in this party. Asked by Sky News host Rita Panahi how the party machinery could stand up against a narrative that it must move to a small-L liberal approach to become electable, Antic said: “The first thing is to switch the fake news antennae off.” Antic appealed to his party colleagues to “push back on these globalist forces that are coming through and climate change is one of them”. “We’ve got to drown out the Guardians, the ABCs – we didn’t do it when we were in power, we’re going to have to do it when we’re in opposition,” he said. “Much of the blame for the teal revolution in this country lays firmly in the lap of conservatives of the last two decades not shooting down this nonsense about climate change, allowing school children to go to sleep upset because they think the world is coming to an end. That has given rope to these teal candidates ... It’s like the parent that says to the child you can’t eat chocolate all day every day and they kick and scream and wail – well, sometimes you’ve got to be a tough parent you’ve got to tell it like it is.” Incoming member for Goldstein, independent Zoe Daniel, acknowledges Tim Wilson’s concession. The peak industry body for the Australian oil and gas industry has congratulated Anthony Albanese on his election win saying it “looks forward to working with any new government”. The acting chief executive for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), Damian Dwyer, said in a statement that the “industry has a track record of working constructively with all governments”: We urge any new administration to continue to recognise the critical role of gas in the future decarbonised energy mix and the development of our region, as well as focusing policy efforts on improving the competitiveness of the nation’s investment environment. We are committed to economy-wide net zero by 2050 and APPEA members are already spending billions of dollars on decarbonisation tools such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen-related technologies. Last week the chief of Santos and former APPEA chair, Kevin Gallagher, told an industry conference that he wasn’t worried about the outcome of the election as “energy security is going to be important, no matter who’s in power”. “My request is that there be no big kneejerk factors, that there’s no big Biden-type policy announcement on day one, in closing things down, because I think that’d be very disruptive,” he said. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. There are currently 12,200km of new gas pipelines proposed for Australia, worth $25.8b, that are a risk of becoming stranded assets as the world moves away from fossil fuels. Wilson indicates he wants to write a book. He says it is a “deeply unsettling” time for the country, and the election has been a reset. But he says it is too early to draw conclusions from the outcome of the election this early. Wilson ends the press conference by saying he always made decisions he felt were in the national interest because that’s the job of a federal parliament. He said he recognised that might not always be popular in the local electorate. Wilson says he is “immensely proud” of everything he achieved in parliament and no one can take it away from him. He says he didn’t think it was an issue with him personally that cost him the seat, stating the issues in his electorate were issues faced in other electorates like Higgins. Wilson lists his opposition to the ratification of an extradition treaty with China, and then the work around the postal survey on same-sex marriage (which Simon Birmingham named as the beginning of the troubles for the Liberals). He also mentions his time as an assistant minister on emissions reduction. He gets emotional when he says thank you to his husband, Ryan Bolger, who is standing beside him. You’ve sacrificed so much for my service I want to say thank you. Liberal MP Tim Wilson has formally conceded Goldstein to independent candidate Zoe Daniel. He has thanked the voters of Goldstein and his staff. My colleague Daniel Hurst has all you need to know on the next steps for the incoming Albanese Labor government. Corflute vandalism (or more accurately, candidates complaining about it) was somewhat prominent this campaign. Looks like it’s still going. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, is holding a press conference on the federal election result. He says SA Labor’s showing has been very strong, and mentions Labor picking up the former Liberal seat of Boothby. He says winning it is “a bit deal” and the fact that winning Sturt is still being talked about is “somewhat astonishing.” Malinauskas says he looks forward to working collaboratively with an Albanese federal Labor government, and he will make sure they deliver for South Australians. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has congratulated Anthony Albanese on his election victory. Sogavare, who has written a letter to Albanese, also assured him “that Solomon Islands remains Australia’s steadfast friend and development partner of choice”. China’s security deal with Solomon Islands, signed during the early stages of the election campaign, was a major point of conflict between the two main political parties. Labor had accused the Coalition of presiding over the worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. Labor also pledged to increase foreign aid, take the climate crisis seriously, and step up maritime assistance to the region. In a statement issued today, Sogavare said Albanese’s election victory “signifies that the people of Australia embraced Mr Albanese’s vision, policy frameworks and the direction he espoused for Australia and more broadly in relation to Australia’s neighbours in the region and internationally”. I write on behalf of my government and the people of Solomon Islands to convey to you, your government and the people of Australia my sincere congratulations on your election victory as the 31st prime minister of Australia to lead Australia into the future. Sogavare said his country remembered “with gratitude and acknowledge with appreciation Australia’s tremendous assistance to Solomon Islands over the years, in particular, during the period of our ethnic unrest when your government and your country together with members of the Pacific Islands Forum assisted us to get back on our feet”. He also acknowledged Australia’s support to respect to unrest in November 2021 and Covid-related assistance earlier this year: My government and people are forever grateful to you, the government and people of Australia for the generous support, financially and in-kind during and after these testing times. Much however, remains to be done. Sogavare concluded by wishing Albanese and his incoming government “all the best as he leads Australia to new heights”. Sogavare “further assured him of taking Solomon Islands’ relationship with Australia to another level under Albanese’s tenure as the prime minister of Australia”. That’s all from me, folks! I foresee a nanna nap in my immediate future. There’s still plenty to unfold in election news, Josh Taylor is here to guide you through it. With outgoing treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on track to lose his seat of Kooyong, the presumptive front-runner for the Liberal leadership is outgoing defence minister, Peter Dutton. Dutton only narrowly lost the leadership ballot to replace Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 to Scott Morrison, 45 votes to 40. The moderate wing of the party, which swung the leadership to Morrison, have suffered the greatest losses, putting Dutton, a conservative, in the box seat. Depending on final results, MPs and senators from Dutton’s home seat of Queensland could make up nearly one quarter of the party room. But the party is still casting around for other options. Guardian Australia has confirmed there are efforts to recruit outgoing trade, tourism and investment minister, Dan Tehan, to run, and outgoing home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, is reportedly in a similar position. On Sunday Andrews did not rule out running for the leadership. She told a doorstop in the Gold Coast: It is way too early to even have a discussion about leadership within the Liberal National party. At this stage the counting of votes is still continuing, [until] we have an indication about who will be elected as members of the House of Representatives and Senate, it is way too early for there to be a conversation about that. At some point, the Liberal party room will meet and we will elect a new leader but that is not a discussion for today. I am not going to engage in the discussion at all, within 24 hours of a devastating loss for the Liberal and National party. Tehan said running for the leadership was the “last thing on my mind” but also didn’t rule it out. He told Sky News: What we’ve got to do is make sure we are looking after those who have lost their seats, make sure we are scrutinising every last vote that comes in. At this stage what we need to be doing is making sure we regroup and come together ... we’ve got to wait and see what happens … there’s still a lot of votes to be counted, it’s far too premature to be having those discussions, we’re 12 hours after election day. Here’s the video of Scott Morrison speaking at Horizon church this morning: Meanwhile, in Christopher Pyne’s old seat: Dr Monique Ryan said earlier the AEC hasn’t declared the seat of Kooyong, and Josh Frydenberg hasn’t called her yet. But she said: I feel like we have succeeded and I will be the next member for Kooyong. She noted that the Liberal party tends not to put women in safe seats, and said: There is a momentum for change in the Australian political system. People like myself, who aren’t career politicians, have a lot to offer. I’ve got a lifetime of lived experience in the acute care health system and the other independents, as well as mature people who have done well in other walks of life and we have got a lot to bring to parliament. She also said quotas have been effective in other industries, and that the Liberal party has a problem with its female representation. Labor MP Terri Butler concedes in Griffith – she’s lost to Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather: The ALP national president (and former treasurer), Wayne Swan, calls the election result a “victory for decency and Labor values”: The ABC’s election coverage has easily won the ratings, with an average of 910,000 viewers in five metro cities tuning in to the panel led by Leigh Sales and election analyst Antony Green. The Seven Network’s coverage was second on Saturday night with an average of 373,000 viewers watching political editor, Mark Riley, and his so-called Screen of Dreams predict the number of seats for each party. Seven claimed on Sunday that Riley, who co-hosted with Natalie Barr and Michael Usher, “beat the pack to declare a Labor majority government and Anthony Albanese as Australia’s new prime minister” – but didn’t give a time for the claim. Channel Nine’s offering hosted by Peter Overton, Alicia Loxley and with analysis from political editor, Chris Uhlmann, was in third spot with 384,000. Ten’s election coverage, hosted by Sandra Sully, Peter van Onselen, Waleed Aly and Hugh Riminton, did not make the top 20. On subscription TV, Sky News Australia’s election coverage was the 10th most popular program of the night, beaten by NRL and AFL matches on Foxtel to average 125,000 viewers. Nick Evershed, the legend behind Guardian Australia’s live votes tracker, has made the following calls: Werriwa – ALP Parramatta – ALP Fowler – IND North Sydney – IND Tangney – ALP See all the details of the margins and the candidates here: Josh Butler has some more details from Scott Morrison’s church visit this morning, including this line from a Bible verse he read: Do not rejoice over me, enemy of mine. Though I fall, I will rise. Though I live in darkness, the Lord is a light for me. Recriminations are continuing in the Liberal party, particularly over the shock loss of heartland blue-ribbon seats. One Liberal told Guardian Australia: The Liberal party is designed to be a broad church. The moderate wing was too easily bulldozed, and there wasn’t enough resistance in the cabinet in particular. Morrisonism has got to be put to death. Morrisonism is economic populism and culture wars – that was poison for us in the city. We’ve got to return to economic rationalism and social liberalism. Criticism is not just limited to Scott Morrison for indulging in culture war issues, but also senior moderates like Marise Payne for not putting a stop to it. The MP said: We haven’t had enough economic policies, and things in the non social side. We indulged too many crazy things. [Warringah candidate Katherine] Deves was emblematic of everything that is wrong with Morrison on these sorts of issues. They made a huge mistake thinking that the party membership base is the voting base. The voting base of the party is much broader, and they voted against this [transphobic] shit yesterday in Warringah. The Liberal source noted that, for all the talk that Deves would help win middle-ring and outer suburban seats, “we didn’t win any of those seats”, not even Parramatta where Maria Kovacic, a strong candidate, faced off against Labor’s Andrew Charlton who ran a “shambolic campaign”. The MP said: We won Hughes, where Jenny Ware spoke out against Katherine Deves. The whole thing’s a joke. Eminent former Pacific leaders have issued their congratulations to Anthony Albanese and urged him to “make a radical shift towards strong and urgent climate action”, including a commitment to no new coal and gas projects. Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati and a leading climate campaigner, said: It is no secret that I have been disappointed with the attitudes of the previous Australian government towards the Pacific on a number of fronts, including climate change. My hope is that we will see stronger and more urgent climate action from the incoming government, including a more ambitious emissions reduction target, ramped-up support for climate-vulnerable communities in the Pacific and most importantly, a commitment to no new coal and gas projects in Australia. Tong said that while he welcomed Albanese’s proposal to host a COP summit in conjunction with Pacific island nations, “this cannot be used to greenwash Australia’s inadequate climate policies”. Enele Sopoaga, the former prime minister of Tuvalu, who clashed strongly with Scott Morrison at the last in-person Pacific Islands Forum in 2019, said he welcomed the incoming government: Time is running out on climate change not only for small island developing states like us in the Pacific, but also for Australia and the rest of the world. Our security, together with our survival, is at peril. I can only hope that this new Australian government will make a radical shift towards strong and urgent climate action and genuine support for the Pacific. This would include radical new Australian targets for emissions reduction under the Paris Agreement, no new coal or gas, and an ongoing commitment to supporting Pacific island nations as we face the brunt of climate impacts. The urgent concern over Australia’s climate policies echoes the congratulatory message from Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who tweeted to Albanese: Of your many promises to support the Pacific, none is more welcome than your plan to put the climate first – our people’s shared future depends on it. Bainimarama also issued an invitation to the incoming prime minister to visit Fiji. Fiji is set to host the Pacific Islands Forum in the coming months and Albanese has indicated he plans to attend the summit, which is the most significant regional diplomatic meeting. The Pacific featured heavily in the election campaign after the Australian government was caught off guard by Solomon Islands signing a security deal with China, which raised concerns about China establishing a military base in the islands. Labor accused the government of dropping the ball in the Pacific and opening the door for increased Chinese influence. The Tamil family fighting for years to return to the Queensland town of Biloela are confident they will be allowed to go home under the new Labor government, AAP reports: Labor promised during the election campaign the Murugappan family – Priya, Nades and their two girls Kopika and Tharnicaa – would be able to return to their beloved town if the party won. Family friend and longtime campaigner, Angela Fredericks, says she called them on Saturday evening to tell them the news of Anthony Albanese’s victory. She said: Many happy tears were shed. We now believe that this long, painful saga can finally come to an end. This family has been away from their home for more than four years. They never should have been taken from the town that loved and needed them. As they make the long journey to Biloela to resume their lives here, they also commence a journey of recovery and healing. You can read the long history of the family’s struggle here. Interesting breakdown from the West Australian’s Annabel Hennessy: The outgoing superannuation minister, Jane Hume, told Guardian Australia the Liberal party has “a fair bit of unpacking to do” but would first have to “grieve for some of our friends”, as the party had lost some of its “intellectual powerhouses” in Saturday’s result. She said: As we’re analysing the drivers of this defeat, we need to ensure all voices are in the room. The Liberal party thrives when all voices are heard. And the country needs a strong Liberal party. There will be a lot of ideas to ensure we don’t remain in opposition, but it’s too early to start. We don’t want to read the entrails until we’ve gutted the chicken. Hume said she was “blindsided” by the result, because voters seemed to be responding well to the Liberal party in places like (Labor-held) Dunkley and (independent-held) Indi. She’s not the only one – many Liberals have commented to Guardian Australia that the mood of the electorate was hard to read, with many voters not engaging and evidently having made their minds up. They walked into booths, not taking how-to-vote cards, heads down, past party volunteers. Like the record numbers who voted early, they just wanted to get it done. Paul Karp’s taken a look at some of the MPs who are holding out on a concession: “One thing is for sure,” Bandt says, “this is a greenslide”. Newly elected senator Penny Allman-Payne steps up and says she’s “not surprised” at the result: We’ve been campaigning for over 12 months, right around the state, and everywhere we’ve gone people have told us they can’t find a house to rent. They can’t afford a home to rent, they can’t afford to buy. People have told us that they can’t get the dental treatment that they need. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is talking now. He says the result in Queensland is a mandate for action on climate and inequality. He says we shouldn’t be giving tax breaks to people like Clive Palmer when people are living in poverty, or can’t afford to get their teeth fixed. He says: We’ll take the fight up to politicians in Canberra every day [for] action on climate and inequality. The Greens are a big part of the reason we’ve seen a change of government. He also welcomed the election of independents who have “helped change the political culture in this country for the better”. Here’s some more from the outgoing prime minister, Scott Morrison, at Horizon church this morning. He thanked people in the church, saying: It’s very special that you’re here today because you’ve walked this journey with us as well as have many others. Jenny and I, and the girls, are grateful to our church family here. You’ve given us a great foundation from which we could walk ... walk what has been a very difficult walk, I’ve got to tell you, over the last almost four years. God calls us, whether you’re a prime minister or a pastor or run agribusiness. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 20 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 758 In hospital: 92 (with 4 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 7 Cases: 8,523 In hospital: 1,165 (with 36 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 183 In hospital: 17 (with 2 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 0 Cases: 4,504 In hospital: 432 (with 17 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 2 Cases: 3,053 In hospital: 224 (with 8 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 782 In hospital: 47 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 10 Cases: 9,307 In hospital: 541 (with 29 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 11,557 In hospital: 326 (with 11 people in ICU) Rogue Liberal senator, Gerard Rennick, has taken aim at Scott Morrison, blaming him for the larger than expected loss, which Liberals had hoped could be confined to the loss of five to 10 seats. Rennick told Guardian Australia: I will say Scott Morrison never had a vision, never had conviction. I went and saw him a number of times, every six months. Every sitting week there was a new crisis and the left was controlling the agenda. He never had a vision, he was just sitting there holding the position but with no clear way forward. What was the pitch - that we were going to provide more of the same? [Australians] didn’t want 3 more years of the shit-throwing that was going on. The only thing we did were those tax cuts - and even then it was arguable whether giving them to people [earning] over $180,000 was a good thing. Rennick said the Liberals had been “bogged down in the covid hysteria” and “didn’t fight the fight on climate change”. He said: We signed up to net zero, and threw shitloads of money at solar and batteries ... We should’ve fought the issue on cost of living again, to argue that it was the most expensive power, like we did last time ... When asked do we care about the environment, we should say ‘yes’. Do we care about plastic? Yes, I hate plastic, there’s so much plastic shit at Christmas. Biodiversity? Yes - I went and travelled the world to see the gorillas after university. But we can protect the environment without believing in this notion that a rise of CO2 is the end of mankind. Rennick said he could have supported net zero if it were teamed with nuclear power and more hydro-electric power. He declined to express a view on the leadership, but suggested Peter Dutton was in the box seat. From Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama: Prime minister-elect Anthony Albanese is talking now, after that morning stop at a cafe. He’s talking about that upcoming trip to Japan for the Quad meeting. He says it was the government’s decision to have the election just days before that critical event, which has led to some haste in getting Albanese sworn in. (Penny Wong, Jim Chalmers, Katy Gallagher and Richard Marles will also be sworn in tomorrow.) Marles will fill his shoes while he’s gone – he’ll be back on Wednesday and will organise a face-to-face meeting with all the premiers and chief ministers then. He describes last night as a “really big moment” in his life, and: What I want it to be is a big moment for the country. I want to change the country, I want to change the way politics works in this country. Now he’s off for a series of briefings. Two people have died from Covid in South Australia. 224 people are in hospital, eight in intensive care. SA recorded 3,053 new cases: Oh, Queensland. You’re overdue a break from these floods: Anthony Albanese got emotional as he talked about committing to the Uluru Statement from the Heart last night: The election result will trigger all sorts of bloodletting within the Coalition. Matt Canavan, the Queensland Nationals senator who has long campaigned against the net zero target, spoke with Guardian Australia a short time ago to give his take on the results. While there have been big gains for the teal independents and the Greens, which have campaigned for much stronger climate action, Canavan says the election sent a clear message to the Coalition that “when we go left, we lose”. Canavan contended that the Coalition went to the election with “a leftist agenda” on climate, but that wasn’t a credible platform: McDonald’s can’t sell health food and the LNP can’t sell socialism. Canavan pushed back at the idea, advanced by senior moderate Liberals, that the Coalition needed to take a stronger climate action policy to the next election, saying: “What more should we do? Should we adopt a carbon tax, should we double the dole?” (Quick side note: neither major party has a policy proposal for a carbon tax, and the Coalition temporarily doubled the jobseeker payment in the early stages of the pandemic.) Canavan, who was pushing for the Nationals to oppose the net zero target last year, said the loss of inner-city seats to the teal independents showed that “the Faustian bargain proved to be a complete failure”, and he blamed the moderates: The policy agenda we took to the election was signed, sealed and delivered by the moderate wing of the Liberal party … Doubling down seems to be the definition of insanity. Asked whether the Coalition should strive to win back those inner-city seats at the next election, Canavan said it should try to win as many seats as possible, but the path to victory would be through the regions and the suburbs. Canavan said the biggest issue for voters was the cost of living but the Coalition “didn’t have a coherent platform” to address that, and it must return to a focus on “kitchen table economics”. We forgot the forgotten people. He said the Coalition should focus on winning back votes that it had lost to One Nation and Clive Palmer’s United Australia party. Asked about Liberal senator Simon Birmingham’s suggestion that the Coalition should now embrace a stronger formal 2030 emissions reduction target, Canavan said: This is all ridiculous - I mean, what the hell? Who cares? Canavan questioned whether there was still an appetite for deep 2030 targets in major emitting countries including the US. By contrast, he said, the National party “had a great night” at the election and he hoped Barnaby Joyce would stay on as leader, citing the need for stability. The teal independent candidates often mentioned Joyce in their campaigning, saying the self-proclaimed moderate Liberals vote the same in the parliament as the Nationals leader. But when asked whether Joyce should be seen as responsible for the Liberal party’s losses in inner city seats, Canavan said he was “not going to apologise for delivering results for regional Australians”. He said that was the nature of Coalition governments. Birmingham told the ABC’s Insiders program earlier today: I would hope that we can continue to work together, but obviously the National Party need to look at where the Liberal Party has felt this pain and reflect upon how it is that we, together, can manage to form majority government in the future and what will be necessary for us to [achieve that]. When asked about this comment, Canavan said: I hope the Coalition stays together. With all due respect to the Liberal party, perhaps they could take a leaf out of the National party … maybe the Liberal party could learn something about the need to stay true to values and principles. There have been no new Covid-19 deaths in Western Australia overnight. The state has reported 11,557 new cases, 326 people in hospital and 11 cases in ICU. Anthony Albanese is in his inner west Sydney neighbourhood of Marrickville this morning and is expected to speak soon. We’ll bring you the latest as it comes. From Horizon church in Sydney (I earlier called it Hillsong, please blame sleep deprivation): Spender says the same-sex marriage debate, and the targetting of trans kids, was something the community “really feels and hates”. She says: The failure to move forward on climate in a constructive way that is good for the economy, absolutely, these are reasons why people are saying, we need to change, we need to stand up and have given up hoping they are going to listen to us. We need to make change in terms of our representation. Spender says of the result: I certainly hope it shows that you can’t ignore women anymore, and it’s saying in a positive way, that in a very constructive way, we want the parliament to represent our community in its fullest terms. We want the parliament to be the best of us. She also says she hasn’t heard from outgoing Liberal MP Dave Sharma yet (and Sharma’s Twitter account appears to have been deleted). New MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, is at Bondi. She says the teal independents will give communities a voice in parliament. You look at the values of this community, we are socially progressive, we are environmentally focused, [these values] were not reflected in the parliament and they were not reflected in the Liberal party. She says she’ll be “urging” and using all her “negotiation power” to push for more rapid action on climate change (she wants a reduction of at least 50% in emissions by 2030). “We need to go back to the values of the Liberal party,” Andrews says, “and make sure we are properly representing the Australian people.” She declines to comment on whether the LNP should disband, and says: The result is still coming in right across Australia, but it’s very clear that at least some of the so-called teal independents have been elected to the House of Representatives, a significant increase in the Greens vote and it appears likely that there will be re-elected and new Green members coming into the House of Representatives. What’s important is that we need to look at what is happening in the inner city seats who have a groundswell of support for the Greens party and for the teal party, the teal independents. It is important that we look at that very closely and see what the applications are in relation to our policies. And she declines to comment on whether she’d run for leader, saying it’s “too early” to discuss. Outgoing home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, is talking about the boats. Not the votes, the boats. She says: It was very difficult when I heard yesterday that a boat had been intercepted in waters off Christmas Island. It will be a matter for the incoming minister of home affairs to deal with that, and resolve those issues. Throughout the campaign and leading up to their campaign, there were accusations of scaremongering by the Coalition in relation to safety and security matters in relation to our borders. Let’s be clear that what we have seen in the last few days is that there have been two boats, headed for Australia. You can read Paul Karp’s story on the boats here: Anthony Albanese will shortly make his first public appearance after claiming victory last night. He’ll pop up in his home electorate of Grayndler a little later today, and is expected to give a press conference at some stage, ahead of being sworn in as prime minister tomorrow. Late last night, following his speech at Labor’s election party, Albanese made what was meant to be a low-key re-entry to the party to mingle with supporters and staff. It turned into an impromptu media doorstop, as TV cameras followed him around the room and peppered him with questions. Clutching a can of his Albo pale ale, the incoming PM said he was “hopeful it will be a majority Labor government, but we’ll wait and see the results as they roll in over coming days”. Albanese watched the results roll in on TV at his Marrickville home, surrounded by his partner Jodie, son Nathan, and a small group of staff and supporters. He said: We didn’t have many people at my place … I cooked dinner for people, pasta. As he turned away from the media scrum, a British reporter from the BBC squeezed in to ask a few questions. Albanese said Labor were “strong supporters” of the Aukus military pact with the United Kingdom and United States: The UK of course is an important ally for Australia. I look forward to working with our friends in the UK. Albanese also noted the action on climate change from British PM Boris Johnson, praising him as “one of the first politicians in the world to raise serious action on climate change”. He said: It’s far less controversial in the UK, it shouldn’t be controversial here. Australian business knows that good action on climate change is good for jobs and good for our economy, and I want to join the global effort. In Queensland, no Covid deaths were recorded. 432 people are in hospital, 17 in intensive care. The state had 4,504 new cases: Frydenberg says it was a Labor and Greens strategy to “run dead” in Kooyong so the independent would win. And that was that. Frydenberg is asked if the result is “payback” from a populace “cranky” from Covid. He says it has been a difficult time for all Australians, but: I don’t think you could draw that conclusion from the election result, about being a pandemic result. I think people understand that the federal government pulled out all stops. We pulled out all stops to support people on both the health and the economic front. Today we have a faster and stronger economic recovery than every major advanced economy in the world. We have a vaccination rate which is in the top 10 of the OECD and we have Covid mortality rate which is the third lowest in the OECD. So I don’t think you could say it is a pandemic election result. I think there are other factors at play. Frydenberg says climate change is “a salient and most important issue, not just here in Kooyong but obviously for the country”. What I do believe is that Australia has not been well served by the culture wars on climate change. Whether you believe in it or don’t believe in it, climate change is not a religion. It needs to be dealt with from a perspective of engineering, economics and also environmental science. The Coalition has achieved a lot in helping Australia meet and beat its emissions reduction targets. He’ll take time now to spend with his family, and to reflect on his future plans. He says he’s 50, and has time to do other things. And: We need to get more women into parliament, that is not only a problem for the Coalition. It is a priority for the other major parties, because what you saw in this election was also the Labor party vote dropped quite substantially. “There is still some gas in this tank,” Frydenberg says: I want every family, every child, every boy and every girl, regardless of their race, their religion, their ethnicity or their colour, to get the same opportunities that I have had, because this is what makes Australia great – equality of opportunities, but not always equality of outcomes. It is a defining principle, it is a defining motivation. For me, it is why I entered politics and why there is still some gas in this tank. He says there were many factors in his party’s defeat, and points out that Scott Morrison has accepted responsibility. He says he remained loyal to Morrison for “stability”: I think he has provided outstanding leadership, extraordinary leadership in extraordinary times. There was no playbook for the pandemic. Yes, not everything went right, but not everything could go right. I am obviously very proud of the fact I was able to serve loyally as his deputy. I have always been loyal in the roles that I have had, whether it was under Tony Abbott or under Malcolm Turnbull, and then under Scott Morrison. I think Australia is best served by stability at the top of the political ladder. The fact that we haven’t had changing prime ministers over the last three years, as we have seen on both sides of the political divide over the previous years, I think is a good thing. And that is one of the reasons why I was obviously strongly supportive and loyal to Scott Morrison. Frydenberg says the past three years serving as treasurer have been “rewarding” but “particularly challenging”. The government “threw everything at the task”, he says, reeling off the low unemployment rate and the turnaround in the bottom line. He says: I am extremely proud of what I’ve been able to achieve as the member for Kooyong, both locally but also serving as the deputy leader of the Liberal party and as the treasurer, most recently, for our great country. He’s always seen politics in a Menzian way, he says, “as a battle of ideas, not a clash of warring personalities”: Sometimes you are dealing with victories, and other times defeat. But what is critically important is that you always retain a sense of perspective and you are reminded of why you went into politics in the first place. What motivated me back 12 years ago to become the member for Kooyong is still what motivates me today, namely to serve my community and to ensure that Australians get the very best opportunities. Josh Frydenberg is talking now, in Melbourne, where his seat is under serious threat from independent Monique Ryan. He says (as he did last night) that it was “mathematically possible” for him to retain Kooyong. He says: With 16,000 postal votes still to count in Kooyong, about 12% of the overall vote, it is mathematically possible that I could retain Kooyong, but it is obviously very, very difficult. That being said, I will wait until more postal votes are counted before saying any more about the particular results in Kooyong. I am extremely proud of what I have been able to achieve, both locally and nationally, over the last 12 years. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has congratulated Anthony Albanese and Labor on winning the Australian election, saying she looks forward to working with the new prime minister. She said: I have no doubt we’ll have a strong working relationship that will serve both countries well. Australia is our most important partner … and I believe our countries will work even more closely together in these tumultuous times. She also acknowledged a “strong working relationship” with outgoing leader Scott Morrison. NZ and Australia, while closely allied, have had some tense moments under Morrison’s leadership – particularly over the Australian “501” policy of deporting residents with NZ citizenship on bad character or criminal record grounds, even if they had lived their entire lives in Australia. In 2020 Ardern lashed out at Morrison at their annual bilateral summit, saying the policy was “testing” the friendship between the two nations, and Australia was deporting “your people and your problems” using “unfair” policies. The NZ government has repeatedly pushed for a reconsideration of the policy, and will likely be hoping for movement under a new government. Also at the top of NZ’s concerns is the wider security of the Indo-Pacific, and the growing influence of China in the region. NZ’s rhetoric on China has typically been gentler than Australia’s, and the country has at times been accused by Australian commentators of being hamstrung by its significant trade reliance on China. Ardern said she looked forward to working with Albanese “on a range of issues including supporting New Zealanders living in Australia, making trans-Tasman business even easier, deepening our partnership with our close friends in the Pacific, and advancing our interests on the world stage”. She said: Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand are at our best when we work together; when we acknowledge our mutual interests, our shared values and the uniqueness of our perspectives; when we stand united as allies and whānau, recognising the strength in our diversity. Joyce congratulated Anthony Albanese, and said he hopes the incoming government “don’t put regional Australia projects to the sword”. He said: We have fought because we need to make Australia a fair place, we need to have an expanse of investment across our nation, we need to invest ... beyond the major cities. Just concentrating on the cities, we will not be making this nation is strong as possible, as quickly as possible, we will be reinvested in the status quo and we need to be more dynamic than that. I think that the National [party will] have a major role to play. I’m in the Nationals. The National vote, we got swings to us. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce says the success of the teal independents has made the Coalition less diverse, the ABC reports: When you look at it, it’s really strange – in attacking the Liberal candidates they’ve removed our Indigenous affairs minister, three openly gay people and one Asian member of parliament, is that what they wanted to achieve? Is that success for them, is it? I think that’s something that people have to reflect on, it’s rather surprising where the moderate side of the party, they’ve been put to the sword by people who say they’re moderates. And just back to Insiders for a second, here are the panellist’s final observations, including a very moving tribute to Caroline Jones from Katharine Murphy: SA Liberal senator Alex Antic says Peter Dutton is a “likely” and a “strong” pick for leader. He says the party should not have capitulated to the net zero emissions target, or mandated vaccines, and he has this insight into what went wrong: The Liberal party’s experiment with the poison of leftism and progressivism must be over. 92 people are in hospital with Covid in the Australian Capital Territory, four in intensive care – and no deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours. 758 new cases were reported: The AEC’s Tom Rogers also thanked staff and voters after a rather large staffing hiccup. He said: I’m so incredibly buoyed, and proud, of the way Australians come together on a day like yesterday – a massive national event all designed and conducted to help Australians have their say. Some polling places had fewer staff than planned due to Covid and flu impacts, and polling officials worked long days but the team rallied together to collect the votes and get through the election night count – delivering an election night result to Australia once again. It is also incredibly pleasing that the vast majority of Australians reported a smooth voting experience, including secure telephone voting for people in isolation with Covid-19. The Australian Electoral Commission’s plan for today (I’ll expand on this in a bit): The ABC’s David Speers asks Daniel what the government should do on gender inequality. She says: Look, I think the main thing is listening and acting. There are things on the table that the Labor party has said it will do, and I will be there to hold them accountable to that. So the Respect At Work report recommendations, for example, narrowing the gender pay gap, more affordable, universal and flexible child care – this is about enabling the women in our community to be part of the workforce and to really achieve their full potential, but the other thing, David, is violence against women and children. This is something that we have to address and we really need a commissioner, I think, with a ten-year depoliticised plan to address that issue, so that’s a key priority for me. And on how the crossbench will work together, she says: Well, independents already communicate and collaborate, and that’s a good thing. I think one of the failings of our two-party system has been their lack of capacity to do that and to achieve that and achieve bipartisanship. I seek to be an honest broker from the crossbench. Yes, there will be conversations with my incoming fellow independents, but what Australia has elected on the crossbench this time around is a community crossbench, a group of people who seek to genuinely engage with and represent their communities, and I think that’s a wonderful thing. She will “absolutely” seek a more ambitious climate target from Labor, she says – she wants a 60% reduction in emissions by 2030. She says she accepts Labor has a mandate, but: I have a mandate for the position of my community, and I will go in and argue that. I also think that any reasonable person looking at the climate targets that we have, and the progress that we are already making, particularly because of actions of state governments, would think that we can afford to actually be a bit more ambitious, so I think we should try. Here’s Daniel’s analysis of why the Coalition lost: Because the Liberal party lost its centre. People who would normally be small-l Liberals or who are potential swinging voters like me, who sort of drift across the centre, had no-one to vote for. The Liberal party had drifted so far to the right that people didn’t feel represented. The Labor party has had an identity crisis where it has been trying to represent the workers and the inner-city professionals, and people like me who sit in the centre and go into the polling booth and think, ‘who on earth will I vote for?’. All of a sudden, people like me popped up in seats and said, ‘hey, here is an alternative. Here is someone who will be a reasonable voice, who can negotiate with both sides, who can solve problems, who can collaborate on these really important issues,’ and issues that I think people feel they haven’t had an actual voice on in a seat like mine, on climate, where they feel they weren’t being represented by the local member. Zoe Daniel, who ousted Liberal MP Tim Wilson from the seat of Goldstein, is up now. She credits the former MP for Indi, Cathy McGowan, for kickstarting the independents’ movement. She says: Certainly not when I originally agreed to step into this, David, but I did come into it to win it. I thought we could be competitive and I think what we saw was momentum that increased not only in the seat of Goldstein by in those other seats across the country during the campaign as people recognised that there was an actual alternative in safe seats, in many cases for the first time, and people really grasped that. It is a hugely positive moment, I think in our political history n the sense that this is a movement that has grown from community. And on Josh Frydenberg’s loss in Kooyong, Birmingham says: It’s a devastating blow, and a loss of some enormous talent there with Josh. But that’s really a matter for Josh to contemplate whether he wants to come back and I don’t think he would expect anybody just to step aside or to cause that sort of disruption. I’m sure Josh could give more to public life. Birmingham says he doesn’t know who he’ll support to be the new Liberal leader. He’ll talk to Peter Dutton, and “other colleagues” as well: It depends on who’s willing to put their hand up and who’s interested and then we can assess it from there. He agrees on issues with Dutton more than people might expect, he says. On whether the Coalition will weather opposition, Birmingham says the agreement between the Liberal and National parties has “served Australia well”, but: The Liberal party needs to always stand for Liberal values and we need to make sure we win back voters who should hold those Liberal values, who do, I think, hold those Liberal values. And on the “women” question: We need to make sure we win back many more of those professionals and especially Australian women who are much more highly educated today thanks to wonderful opportunities provided by successive governments and a cohort that clearly we have failed to have represent ... we need to make sure we turn that around as well as the types of policies necessary to appeal to them. The Coalition should commit to a more ambitious climate target, Birmingham says: We need to make sure that Australians understand we acknowledge the science of climate change and some of us always have, but all of us must. We acknowledge the need for Australia to play a leading role in action around the world and that we get our language as well as our policies right in that space. Given the fact that we are looking like we will exceed that 2030 position of 26 to 28%, of course, we should commit to being able to go further. We obviously are a country who has shown great leadership actually in terms of the development of renewable resources. As I have said many times before, and it does remain a fact - our emissions exceed many others around the world. It should be a point of national celebration and where we can exceed our existing targets, then we should make sure that we do stretch to exceed those targets. Asked where it all went so wrong, Birmingham says: You can go back to the same-sex marriage debate which dragged out unnecessarily long, but it should have been resolved by a simple conscience vote. I think the turning point was the failure in relation to the National Energy Guarantee. At that point, there was an opportunity for the Liberal party to lock into a policy in relation to energy markets and climate reductions in the energy sector and to lock into it in a way that could have achieved a degree of bipartisanship and put some of these matters behind us and the failure to be able to do so at that time has cost a significant price down the track. The last election we saw perhaps both a message and a masking, if you like, the message came in the seat of Warringah and the result that Tony faced there and we should have acknowledged that had broader implications than just as it related to Tony. The masking was, of course, that the very high taxing policies Labor was honest about at the last election meant that we were able to hold on in seats that perhaps had the same sentiment as Warringah, but didn’t quite go there last time. And now we’re paying the price for that. Senior Liberal senator Simon Birmingham (former finance minister) is on Insiders now. He congratulates Anthony Albanese, and says there were “many interesting factors” in the election loss, and: You can see from the state of their primary vote that fewer than one in three Australians voted for the Labor party. This is perhaps the weakest mandate for an incoming government in Australia’s history. It presents a challenging set of circumstances, because obviously we have lost and we have been delivered a comprehensive message from parts of the community, but we also have held on to what you would usually think would be the types of seats that precipitated a change of government, seats like Bass and Braddon, Lindsay or Longman appeared to have been held by the Liberal party and so it’s quite a challenging set of circumstances when you then look at where we have lost, and particularly traditionally heartland seats. That is perhaps the loudest message to the Liberal party and it’s the one we are going to have to heed most strongly if we are to ensure that we’re in a position to be able to come back in three years’ time. Will you stick with your existing climate policy? Marles says yes. That’s what we sought a mandate for and that’s what we will take to the parliament. It was a “desperate campaign” by the Coalition to paint Labor as too friendly to China, Marles says: I think it’s really important that we are getting our questions right around our regional relationships in the Pacific, as I have said, around the hard power equation, meaning our procurements and particularly in terms of submarines, it’s fundamentally important to building Australia’s strategic space. China remains a significant challenge. And we will seek to engage in the world and in a professional and a thoughtful way, we’re obviously believers in diplomacy. But China under President Xi has sought to shape the world around it in a way we have never seen before and it does present challenges for the nation. And we need to make sure that we meet those challenges and we do that by making sure that we are getting our relationships right in the region, that we pay the Pacific the attention that it deserves which this Government - this Coalition Government plainly failed to do. And that we get the hard power equation right. The failure in respect of the management of submarines is just about the biggest procurement failure in defence that we have seen in our country’s history. It has left us dangerously exposed in terms of the capability gap for the next generation of submarine and all of that must be addressed. The ABC’s David Speers asks Marles about the 4% drop in Labor’s primary vote in Victoria. Covid was part of it, he says, and: We will unpack what is a very complicated election and make sure as professionals that we learn everything that there is to learn from it. There clearly has been a lot of independents running who have received strong support and that speaks to a splintering of the primary vote across the board. I would point out that the two party-preferred vote across the nation is strong and, indeed, our result in Victoria in terms of a two-party preferred result is strong. Labor will “learn the lessons” from Fowler, where party star Kristina Keneally is likely to have missed out (Marles points out they haven’t conceded yet). Keneally has been an “enormous asset” for Labor, but Marles says it’s too early to discuss whether she’ll pop up somewhere else. Marles declines to reveal which roles he’ll have, and says he’d “get off on the wrong foot” with the new prime minister if he announced that now. He won’t be going to Japan with Albanese, which leaves him as acting prime minister in Albanese’s absence. Deputy prime minister (elect), Richard Marles, says the election was a “historic moment”. He tells the ABC: I think Anthony Albanese’s achievement really over the last three years, which has been as difficult a period in which I can remember to lead Labor, both after the grief, really, of the 2019 result, but then clearly leading us through the pandemic when the place of oppositions is not very significant. He also says there won’t be any deals in forming government, while working with the crossbench is always necessary: I think there is a bit of counting to go, and we are hopeful that we can achieve a majority in our own right. The point that we’ve made all through the campaign is that what we are taking to the Australian people is what we will take to the parliament, so there are not going to be any deals in forming government. I would also make the point, though, that whatever happens in the House of Representatives, we absolutely know that there will be a crossbench in the Senate, as there has been throughout my political life, and working with crossbenchers is always needed to be done in order to get legislation through. This isn’t over yet: From the Greens candidate for Franklin, Jade Darko: News.com.au’s Samantha Maiden tells Insiders the election shows “women didn’t believe Scott Morrison got them... and in the end they ‘got’ Scott Morrison”. David Crowe, from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, says “there was an element of the government passing its use-by date” and that Morrison got on the wrong side of Australians on “issue after issue after issue”, including on women, integrity, the fires, the floods, the vaccine rollout, and the Rats distribution. Our own Katharine Murphy says it was more than a repudiation of Morrison, it was “a repudiation of the way politics was conducted”: Last night we saw the most substantial realignment of the electorate that I have seen in my reporting lifetime. Prime minister-elect Anthony Albanese will be sworn in tomorrow, along with senior members of his cabinet before travelling to Japan for the Quad meeting – the ABC reports he’s likely to hold a press conference later today (you’d hope so!). Outgoing prime minister Scott Morrison left Kirribilli House with his family this morning, but hasn’t spoken to the media. The ABC reports the Morrisons are preparing to move back to “the Shire”. Josh Butler brings the colour from the Labor party party: It was only around the time the pyramid of Albo ale cans was built – red cylinders piled four rows high – that Labor supporters started daring to believe they’d gotten home. The Liberal party learning the lessons of the election... or not: And in Victoria, 10 people have died. 541 people are in hospital with Covid, 29 in intensive care. Victoria recorded 9,307 new cases: Seven people have died from Covid in New South Wales. 1,165 people are in hospital, 36 in intensive care. NSW recorded 8,523 new cases: The Australian Senate, master of the plot twist: The results in Western Australia were just one of the surprise outcomes of the election. Narelle Towie reports: Followed by this: Ryan’s asked about whether she’ll be “malleable” on issues of national security, including Chinas. She says: Well, I wouldn’t say I was malleable, but I would say I’m a pragmatist ... and a sensible person who is results driven. I’ll work with the government in a sensible and responsible fashion. I think that we have heard from the electorate how they feel about the Coalition’s sloganeering and negative campaigning. I think, hopefully, we can move on from that and work towards a more positive, less partisan future where the major parties work together with the crossbench in order to secure the outcomes that the people of Australia want. Ryan repeats what she said earlier, that she will offer confidence and supply to Labor only if there’s a more ambitious climate change target. She supports Warringah independent MP Zali Steggall’s plan for a 60% reduction in emissions by 2030 as an “absolute minimum”. I will work with Zali Steggall and hopefully with other members of the crossbench in order to secure movement towards that. The Labor party’s stated aim of a low 40s reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 is inadequate and we need to do better than that. Ryan (who has magically appeared on ABC television as she was still talking on radio) says she had a grassroots campaign “the likes of which has never been seen before”. She still hasn’t had a concession call from Josh Frydenberg. The ABC’s Fran Kelly calls her the “giant killer” of the campaign, and asks her about a reference she made in a tweet last night to waking up this morning, feeling like she was in a “strange dream”. She says:. Just that the song that we played last night was Hunters &amp; Collectors’ song, the Holy Grail. The first line of that is, ‘I woke up this morning from the strangest dream, I was in the biggest army the world has ever seen..’ Ryan says the independents will work together, and also work with the major parties (she was asked whether there would be a formal “teal” group working together). But they’re not a party, she says: No, we’re not a party in any way, shape or form. She says she doesn’t see Frydenberg as a liberal (I’m assuming she means small ‘l’ liberal), and: There’s been a teal revolution at this election, and it’s the power of democracy ... I find it incredible that people have spoken in this way. Things have changed ... and the independent movement is here to stay. Dr Monique Ryan, who’s nicked Kooyong from Josh Frydenberg, says the results show Australians are “really dissatisfied with the government that we’ve had for the last several years”. We want action on climate change, we want integrity and transparency in government, we want better gender equity, and we want a more generous approach to the most vulnerable. And if there’s a hung parliament, she says, she won’t deliver Labor confidence and supply unless they offer a more ambitious climate change target. Gallagher won’t rise to the bait on whether that big teal and Greens crossbench could force Labor to take more dramatic climate action. She says: We had a clear target in the election campaign, a clear policy, and in government we’ll do exactly what we said we would do. Incoming finance minister Katy Gallagher tells ABC radio that Australians voted on the “clear issues” of the campaign including climate and integrity. She says Labor has the “right economic plan” (which has echoes of Scott Morrison on the campaign trail). And it will end the climate wars, she says. Asked if there’s scope for a more ambitious climate policy, she says: We’ll implement the plan we took to the election, but it’s clear Australians want to end the climate wars and see real action on climate change, climate policy, and all the economic opportunities that will come. That Paul Karp wields his words real good: The Liberals flirted with turning the ABC coverage on blast on the big screen, but when Antony Green observed that he couldn’t see the Liberals winning more than 70 seats, suddenly the feed was cut in favour of soft aimless jazz, pervasive elevator music the soundtrack to attenuated disappointment. ABC radio will have Monique Ryan (the likely new MP for Kooyong) and Katy Gallagher (the likely new finance minister) on shortly. And not long after that: Winners and losers will shortly emerge from under their doonas to continue dissecting the election results. While they were sleeping, France’s outgoing foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, had some things to say about Scott Morrison’s defeat. He said the Coalition’s dumping of the submarine deal with his country showed “brutality and cynicism” and even possibly “unequivocal incompetence”. He said: I can’t stop myself from saying that the defeat of Morrison suits me very well. We have many crunched numbers for you here, on our live results page: There’s much more to discuss about downstairs, but let’s take a peek upstairs. The Senate, the house of review, is often hostile to whoever holds power in the House of Representatives. The new Labor government is likely to face a crossbench dominated by the Greens – as Ben Raue writes, that’s a friendlier scenario. (Although, while Anthony Albanese promised an end to the climate wars, it will be interesting to see how the Greens wield their new power to force faster climate change action). Here’s Raue: If you’re already on the move, plug in your headphones. Katharine Murphy and Lenore Taylor (already!) have a podcast out. They’re talking to Jane Lee about, well, everything – including that outlandishly large crossbench: Sarah Martin pulled together the threads from yesterday (and into this morning’s wee hours), including prime minister-elect Anthony Albanese’s victory speech. He said: Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I’m honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st prime minister of Australia. Read her full piece here: And before we wade right into the weeds, Katharine Murphy (somehow, after a very long day) wrote this sharp, incisive piece on how the Liberal party got here, and where it might go next: We’re going to come at you hard and fast this morning. It’s going to be wild. But if you’re still caffeinating and getting your day under way, here’s a nice transition piece. Please enjoy pics of the pooches at polling places: Welcome to the morning after the night before! Australia has a new prime minister, the Greens’ and the teals’ stars are rising, and Scott Morrison will hand over to a new Liberal leader. The political landscape has had (and sorry for the overused word, here) a seismic shift. In his acceptance speech, Anthony Albanese pledged to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart, to end the climate wars, and to oversee a kinder and more caring government. He said: I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and not fear. Optimism, not fear and division. And we’ll hear more about how the women roared in this election. A shock loss (to be specific, an expected but nearly certain loss) was Josh Frydenberg, whose seat of Kooyong is set to fall to independent Monique Ryan, leaving Peter Dutton (who himself got a scare in the early counting) as the front Liberal leader contender. Moderate Tim Wilson lost Goldstein to independent Zoe Daniel, and other moderates including Dave Sharma, Trent Zimmerman and Jason Falinski also looked set to lose. A Labor majority is not yet confirmed, but Albanese said his team would get straight to work – the first thing on his agenda is going to Japan for the Quad meeting together with foreign affairs minister Penny Wong. In the wee hours of this morning, both major parties sat on primary votes in the low 30s, and both had swings against them. The Greens had a 2.3% lift, and were hopeful of picking up two more lower house seats on top of those already declared. A swag of seats are still too close to call. The counting continues today, and Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Josh Butler, Paul Karp, and the rest of the Guardian Australia team will make sure you’re kept in the loop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-14T19:30:31Z","webTitle":"‘The only response is humility' – Labour MPs and activists on what went wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result","fields":{"headline":"‘The only response is humility' – Labour MPs and activists on what went wrong","bodyText":"Michael Chessum Former member of the Momentum steering committee In the coming days, two Labour tribes will put forward two simple narratives about the election. One will argue that Labour’s mistake was to offer a second referendum. The other will pin the blame squarely on the left – not just on Corbyn, but on Labour’s radical programme. Stuck in the middle will be the party membership, the overwhelming majority of whom are both opposed to Brexit and firmly on the left of Labour. Both narratives are wrong. In the end Labour did not do enough to persuade people of the policy, but had it failed to back a final say on Brexit, it would have faced oblivion as the Remain vote split even more evenly with the Lib Dems. And while Labour’s manifesto might have been inadequately communicated, its headline policies were overwhelmingly popular. Without either, Labour would never have been able to inspire the biggest ground operation in British political history. Jeremy Corbyn will now face a whirlwind of recrimination, and it is undeniable he was unpopular on the doorstep. But the truth is he found Labour a rightwardly drifting shell and will leave it a mass movement that could yet transform Britain. As an internally unifying figure with a democratic mandate, there is no reason why he, or someone he appoints, should not stay to ensure an orderly transition. Corbyn’s mistakes came when he held back. On issues like immigration and party reform, he was forced to balance the radicalism of the mass movement with the conservatism of key institutional allies like Len McCluskey. On the crucial issue of the day, Brexit, Labour’s strategy was a protracted series of handbrake turns and triangulations, not principled stands. The result is, for now, both Remainers and Corbynites have lost. To win again, they will need each other. MPs Lucy Powell and Shabana Mahmood Members of Labour Together Labour candidates and activists worked hard in all weathers, to try to achieve a transformative Labour government with energy, enthusiasm and dedication. We promised real, radical change that we thought the country needed, but it’s clear our offer to the electorate was resoundingly rejected. We don’t pretend to have all the answers as to why we lost, but we campaigned across the north and the Midlands, and understand the challenges we faced in our heartland and marginal seats. Our starting point for a Labour recovery can’t be to pick the things we like and blame the things we don’t. Some want to say our defeat was all about Jeremy Corbyn; others that it was only Brexit. Both are wrong. Our losses were about both and much, much more. We must now undertake a real, meaningful review with everything on the table, and no no-go areas. It must start from a place of humility which acknowledges Labour got it wrong rather than the voters, with a process that involves the whole of our movement, and those who feel we’ve left them behind. There’s no quick fix. Nor would a quick leadership election defined by the same factional infighting that’s plagued us for the past three years move us forward. It would probably do the opposite. Whether you’re the leader, an MP, a defeated candidate or a party member, we’ve all got a lot to face up to here. It’s not easy but every one of us must face truths we’ve been ducking, accept our preferred path isn’t working or that we’ve lost touch with those we think we are in politics to help and represent. Until we collectively go through this reconciliation and contrition together, we can’t start the long road back to winning elections again. Stephen Doughty Labour and Cooperative MP for Cardiff South and Penarth Hundreds of thousands of Labour activists put their hearts and souls into trying to stop Boris Johnson and offer a new direction – and the sense of despair and outright fear of what the Tories might do now is stark. In the face of such a huge defeat, the only response must be humility, honesty and utterly frank reflection – urgently – on the part of everyone from the leadership down. Anyone who spoke to former Labour voters on the doorstep knows that the reason for our defeat started first with their views on the leadership – and went well beyond Brexit – into a much wider set of fears about our credibility on everything from national security to spending. We cannot afford to linger on for months in mourning delusion, or brush the reasons for our defeat under the carpet – we must reorganise swiftly and radically for the sake of those who will need us more than ever to stand up for them in the difficult years ahead. Peter Kyle Labour MP for Hove Brexit isn’t a natural disaster to which we were innocent bystanders. It is a political crisis that brutally exposed the failings of our party leadership. Policy development was never rooted in the reality of Leave or Remain communities, nor the aspirations and anxieties of Leave or Remain voters. Hence we landed in the absurd position where Leavers thought we were a Remain party and Remainers thought we were a Leave party. We didn’t get here by accident, we were led here. Similarly, confusion reigned in a plethora of other areas, from our response to Russia’s attack on Salisbury to climate change targets, and voters were watching. Beyond policy, Brexit shone the brightest of lights on those at the top of our movement and found them constantly warring, incapable of basic managerial competence. New members flocked towards a kinder, gentler politics but were betrayed by a culture of authoritarianism, bullying and organisational incompetence. If we end the nastiness in our party and root ourselves in the realities of a 21st-century economy, we have a chance. Labour failed to win more support than the Tories in any socioeconomic group, including the working class. We’re a divided country yearning for a patriotic party that values wealth creation as well as social justice. Voters also said we needed to look more competent, questioning how a party that can’t manage antisemitism out of its own party could possibly run the Home Office. We must move forward, fast. Tom Watson has gone, Jeremy is going, and Len McCluskey must follow. They’ve been waging an ideological and personal war for decades and must now leave others to build a movement fit for the future, rooted in the future, and capable of carrying Labour to power in order to shape the future. Lisa Nandy Labour MP for Wigan We’ve lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent. Taken individually, so many of the policies in Labour’s manifesto were popular with the public, but as a package, failed to touch the sides of what people feel is really needed. In my town, Wigan, many people get through the week with less than £1 left at the end of it. There is an overwhelming sense of anxiety and insecurity, with a safety net that feels frayed and weak. People struggle and make real sacrifices and they want things to improve, for them, their children. They want to get on, and to get that support: a hand-up so they can take care of themselves. Romanticising the struggle deeply offends them, and the message of solidarity is undermined by some policies that make little sense. Nationalising rail is a good, sound policy, but should we have staked so much of our campaign on it when so many towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it’s one of the best sources of good jobs outside London? What is the point of a minimum-income guarantee if you have to stack shelves for the rest of your life and want something more, or a big offer on tuition fees if you can’t see a way of getting through college? If we’re to represent the country, we need to understand it, see it as it really is, not how we might imagine it to be, and to live and experience things as the people we fight for do. We need to understand how we protect and preserve what matters, in communities north and south, towns and cities, Leave and Remain. What holds us together as a movement is our faith in each other, in our communities – as diverse and complex as we know them in reality to be. We have to turn away from a politics that is reductionist and binary which can only push so many people further apart. • The caption of the main image of this article was amended on 18 December 2019 because it incorrectly stated that Corbyn was pictured with his wife, Laura Alvarez."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/aug/07/fossil-fuel-lobby-pollute-politics-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-07T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"How the world’s dirtiest industries have learned to pollute our politics | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/07/fossil-fuel-lobby-pollute-politics-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/07/fossil-fuel-lobby-pollute-politics-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"How the world’s dirtiest industries have learned to pollute our politics","bodyText":"The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice. Just as we need to rise above self-interest and short-termism, governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests. In the United Kingdom, the US, Brazil, Australia and many other nations, pollutocrats rule. The Earth’s systems are breaking down at astonishing speed. Wildfires roar across Siberia and Alaska – biting, in many places, deep into peat soils, releasing plumes of carbon dioxide and methane that cause more global heating. In July alone, Arctic wildfires are reckoned to have released as much carbon into the atmosphere as Austria does in a year: already the vicious twister of climate feedbacks has begun to turn. Torrents of meltwater pour from the Greenland ice cap, sweltering under a 15C temperature anomaly. Daily ice losses on this scale are 50 years ahead of schedule: they were forecast in the climate models for 2070. A paper in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the thawing of permafrost in the Canadian High Arctic now exceeds the depths of melting projected by scientists for 2090. While record temperatures in Europe last month caused discomfort and disruption, in south-west Asia they are starting to reach the point at which the human body hits its thermal limits. Ever wider tracts of the world will come to rely on air conditioning, not only for basic comfort but also for human survival: another feedback spiral, as air conditioning requires massive energy use. Those who cannot afford it will either move or die. Already, climate breakdown is driving more people from their homes than either poverty or conflict, while contributing to both these other factors. A recent paper in Nature shows that we have little hope of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating unless we retire existing fossil fuel infrastructure. Even if no new gas or coal power plants, roads and airports are built, the carbon emissions from current installations are likely to push us past this threshold. Only by retiring some of this infrastructure before the end of its natural life could we secure a 50% chance of remaining within the temperature limit agreed in Paris in 2015. Yet, far from decommissioning this Earth-killing machine, almost everywhere governments and industry stoke its fires. The oil and gas industry intends to spend $4.9tn over the next 10 years, exploring and developing new reserves, none of which we can afford to burn. According to the IMF, every year governments subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn – many times more than they spend on addressing our existential predicament. The US spends 10 times more on these mad subsidies than on its federal education budget. Last year, the world burned more fossil fuels than ever before. An analysis by Barry Saxifrage in Canada’s National Observer shows that half the fossil fuels ever used by humans have been burned since 1990. While renewable and nuclear power supplies have also risen in this period, the gap between the production of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy has not been narrowing, but steadily widening. What counts, in seeking to prevent runaway global heating, is not the good things we start to do, but the bad things we cease to do. Shutting down fossil infrastructure requires government intervention. But in many nations, governments intervene not to protect humanity from the existential threat of fossil fuels, but to protect the fossil fuel industry from the existential threat of public protest. In the US, legislators in 18 states have put forward bills criminalising protests against pipelines, seeking to crush democratic dissent on behalf of the oil industry. In June, Donald Trump’s administration proposed federal legislation that would jail people for up to 20 years for disrupting pipeline construction. Global Witness reports that, in several nations, led by the Philippines, governments have incited the murder of environmental protesters. The process begins with rhetoric, demonising civil protest as extremism and terrorism, then shifts to legislation, criminalising attempts to protect the living planet. Criminalisation then helps legitimise physical assaults and murder. A similar demonisation has begun in Britain, with the publication by a dark money-funded lobby group, Policy Exchange, of a report smearing Extinction Rebellion. Like all such publications, it was given a series of major platforms by the BBC, which preserved its customary absence of curiosity about who funded it. Secretly funded lobby groups – such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance, the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs – have supplied some of the key advisers to Boris Johnson’s government. He has also appointed Andrea Leadsom, an enthusiastic fracking advocate, to run the department responsible for climate policy, and Grant Shapps – who until last month chaired the British Infrastructure Group, which promotes the expansion of roads and airports – as transport secretary. Last week the Guardian revealed documents suggesting that the firm run by Johnson’s ally and adviser Lynton Crosby has produced unbranded Facebook ads on behalf of the coal industry. What we see here looks like the denouement of the Pollution Paradox. Because the dirtiest industries attract the least public support, they have the greatest incentive to spend money on politics, to get the results they want and we don’t. They fund political parties, lobby groups and thinktanks, fake grassroots organisations and dark ads on social media. As a result, politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest industries. We are told to fear the “extremists” who protest against ecocide and challenge dirty industry and the dirty governments it buys. But the extremists we should fear are those who hold office. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2019/jul/02/wimbledon-70m-roof-court-no-1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-02T08:15:20Z","webTitle":"Wimbledon can’t really disguise change when it’s a £70m roof | Matthew Engel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/02/wimbledon-70m-roof-court-no-1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/02/wimbledon-70m-roof-court-no-1","fields":{"headline":"Wimbledon can’t really disguise change when it’s a £70m roof","bodyText":"The crumbling porch at the entrance of that once fine edifice, the United Kingdom, is held up by a series of Corinthian columns: the monarchy, the great public schools, the ancient universities … They have much in common. A rich patina of tradition suffuses everything they do. They all run their own operations skilfully; and they have the knack of creating an image of constancy while continually updating themselves, a process assisted by having vast reserves of money. The All England Lawn Tennis Club is more an offshoot of the establishment than an integral part of it. But it is perhaps the most perfect example of this genre. And here we are again: summertime and all that. God’s in his heaven, Sue Barker’s on the telly, all’s right with the world and everything is as it always was. Except in those cases where it isn’t. This year there have been two major innovations at Wimbledon. One is the new roof on No 1 Court: 70m quids’ worth of new clobber. It has not been in use yet; indeed the BBC – and it is very much its fortnight – is predicting there will be no rain between now and the men’s final. But the roof is THERE. And somehow it feels more intrusive in repose than its 10-year-old Centre Court sister. It broods above this formerly charming tennis court like some mega-piece of industrial machinery. I began to feel we were in the innards of a nuclear power station, possibly with Homer Simpson in the umpire’s chair pushing buttons at random. This reverie was abetted by the presence on court of the Romanian Simona Halep, who accompanies every shot with the noise that might represent the death throes of a strangled gazelle. Or maybe an alarm proclaiming that the reactor core was going into meltdown. One can see that the Centre Court roof was a worthwhile investment to guard the tournament against really bad weather. But the extra one feels like a luxury item. By my reckoning £70m could build about 1,750 tennis courts across the UK. But there is one further characteristic that links this array of successful British institutions: a ruthless focus on their self-interest. The other change may also not be needed this fortnight. The ludicrous matches last year between giant men with giant serves finally forced Wimbledon into accepting last-set tie-breaks. They decided not to resort to them at 6-6, as in the other sets, but only at 12-12, by which point the crowd’s enthusiasm is starting to morph towards exasperation. Since the turn of this century, only 14 singles matches (only one of those in the women’s event) have ever got that far. It seemed like a good compromise, dealing with extreme situations without bringing great gladiatorial battles to a premature end. It also appears as though Wimbledon tennis has now lost the distinction it shared with baseball of being theoretically interminable. Baseball remains like that: if the scores stay level, the contest keeps going. And maybe the tennis could still be the same. Anyone who watched John Isner (6ft 10in) and Kevin Anderson (6ft 8in) in their semi-final last year could imagine them continuing a tie-break to infinity by dive‑bombing each other without dropping a service point. There was a newcomer to their ranks this year, the 21-year-old American Reilly Opelka, winner of the boys’ singles in 2015. He was tall then. He is now officially 6ft 11in, apparently the tallest tennis professional of all time. He beat a somewhat smaller German in straight sets, playing good all-round tennis rather than relying on an impossible serve. This was on Court seven, which is like playing tennis on the concourse at Euston. The world passed by, many pausing just long enough to point to Opelka and gasp. I squeezed on to one of the few benches and found myself next to the Opelka family, none that tall but very friendly. “Has his height been a plus or a minus?” I wondered. “Both,” said his uncle Frank. “For years he’s had people coming up to him and saying: ‘What basketball team do you play for?’ He just wanted it to stop.” Let’s hope he now makes himself famous for his tennis. But after last year, there might just be a certain prejudice against the Brobdingnagians. Anderson, 26-24 winner over Isner a year ago, was shunted out on to No 3 Court at 11am on day one. Considering he was not just last year’s runner-up but is also the No 4 seed, that seemed rather insulting. Fourth seed is a position normally occupied by the grand chieftain of the Murray clan. And when the hell did he last play on No 3 Court?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2019/sep/10/us-briefing-wilbur-ross-taliban-talks-and-vaping-lawsuits","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-10T10:33:05Z","webTitle":"US briefing: Wilbur Ross, Taliban talks and vaping lawsuits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/us-briefing-wilbur-ross-taliban-talks-and-vaping-lawsuits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/us-briefing-wilbur-ross-taliban-talks-and-vaping-lawsuits","fields":{"headline":"US briefing: Wilbur Ross, Taliban talks and vaping lawsuits","bodyText":"Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories.

Visitor numbers to the site of the former Soviet-era power plant in Ukraine have soared since the five-part miniseries began airing on HBO and Sky Atlantic in May, with some tour companies reporting a 40% increase in bookings. But the behaviour of some visitors has been met with criticism, with photographs emerging of tourists beaming or posing provocatively in front of the ruins. In one image, which has circulated widely on social media, a woman unzips a hazmat suit to reveal a G-string. Several of the images have since been deleted. Craig Mazin, the American screenwriter behind the show, tweeted: “It’s wonderful that #ChernobylHBO has inspired a wave of tourism to the Zone of Exclusion. But yes, I’ve seen the photos going around. “If you visit, please remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there. Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacrificed.” The explosion in 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is likely to be responsible for 4,000 deaths from radiation exposure, according to the World Health Organization. An estimated 116,000 people who lived in the town of Pripyat and within a 30km (18.6-mile) radius of the site were evacuated in the weeks following the disaster, though the effects of radiation exposure for the broader population of Ukraine and Europe is still a concern. An exclusion zone of more than 2,600 sq km remains sealed off. Visitors to the zone do not need to wear hazmat suits but are warned not to touch anything. They pass through military passport checks to enter and are scanned for radiation levels. A tour guide at the site, Viktoria Brozhko, attributed the recent rise in the number of visitors to the success of the drama. “Many people come here. They ask a lot of questions about the TV show, about all the events. People are getting more and more curious,” she told Reuters. The presence among them of Julia Baessler, an Austrian student and a “bikini addict” with 320,000 followers on Instagram, caused anger among Twitter users, who accused her of exploiting the disaster for personal gain. In response, Baessler accused her critics of sexism, saying she had first visited Chernobyl before the series aired because of her interest in history and nuclear physics. “I don’t want to be seen as an influencer going to Chernobyl because it’s trendy now,” she told Business Insider. “That’s not true.” Mazin’s warning to visitors follows concerns about the behaviour of some tourists at other sensitive sites, where places that were once the scenes of immense horror or tragedy are used by a minority as the backdrop to the perfect selfie. In March, the museum at Auschwitz tweeted a plea for greater respect from visitors, illustrating its comments with photos of people balancing on the former Nazi concentration camp’s railway tracks. “When you come to @AuschwitzMuseum, remember you are at the site where over 1 million people were killed. Respect their memory. There are better places to learn how to walk on a balance beam than the site which symbolises deportation of hundreds of thousands to their deaths,” the museum said. Others expressed distaste at the decision of the Venice Biennale to exhibit a ship that sank in the Mediterranean in 2015 with hundreds of migrants and refugees onboard – it, too, became a favoured destination for selfies during the art fair last month. The Guardian’s art critic, Adrian Searle, called it “a vile and mawkish spectacle”, adding: “The best one can say of Büchel’s intervention is that it brings us face to face with death. Biennale visitors pause to take selfies in front of it.” An Israeli artist who was offended at some visitors’ use of the Holocaust memorial in Berlin for tasteless photo-ops – including striking yoga poses, juggling or jumping between its concrete slabs – has launched an art project in which their photographs are combined with real, distressing images taken from the concentration camps. Chernobyl, starring Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård and Emily Watson, and directed by Johan Renck, follows the immediate aftermath of the nuclear reactor explosion at the power plant in the town of Pripyat, and the political repercussions of the toll it took on the people, animals and environment in the region. It has been lauded as “masterful television” that avoids glamourising the disaster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/oct/06/our-loyalty-uk-not-austria-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-06T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Our loyalty is to the UK, not Austria | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/06/our-loyalty-uk-not-austria-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/06/our-loyalty-uk-not-austria-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: our loyalty is to the \tUK, not Austria","bodyText":"Kate Connolly’s story appeared to highlight that, like author Edmund de Waal, descendants of those whose country disowned them in the 1930s would be returning to claim the offer of an EU passport (“Top author: ‘Vienna’s Nazis expelled my family.

It is somewhat ironic that this article came out on the day that Austrians voted in large numbers for the centre-right Austrian People’s party of Sebastian Kurz, which was previously propped up in power by the far-right Freedom party. My family, like de Waal’s, were variously expelled, transported, killed and had their wealth confiscated. My mother, at 95, who lives in Walton-on-Thames, was originally placed in a ghetto of Vienna called Leopoldstadt and then sent to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz (where her father was gassed), then Belsen and was finally liberated from Salzwedel.

Anthony Lipmann Bridgwater, Somerset More visibility for disability It was great to see reference to the lack of disability in children’s books, something David Baddiel’s efforts may address (“Young readers need more wheelchair whizzkids and one-armed bandits – Baddiel”, News). However, one of the really annoying omissions in the subject of disability is the complete lack of mention in all the Christmas cards sold. Not a wheelchair or a walking aid in sight or, for that matter, hearing or sight loss! All the many charities that try to get us to buy their Christmas cards, many of them supporting aspects of disability, ignore the subject in their non-religious cards. Anne Keat Corsham, Wiltshire End this hysteria over vaping Further to your report on lung disease and vaping (“Lung disease from vaping has hit Britain, says expert”, News): as of writing this, 12 people have died in the US, one has died in Britain and many more cases of related illnesses have emerged. All cases involve either the use of nicotine e-liquid and/or black market cannabis oil. In the US, Trump’s administration and several states have taken the laziest approach (both mentally and politically) of reacting to these reports in a drug-war-like manner and concluded that vaping must be tightly restricted or flavours must be banned. However, it is important to remember that, as long as vaping is a “safer” alternative to smoking, there is a strong argument for it being readily available. In the US, 480,000 people die every year from smoking, while alcohol is a cause of 88,000 adult deaths and 4,000 youth deaths a year. Yet calls to criminalise alcohol or smoking are rightly seen as counterproductive, harmful and illogical. We cannot let drug war hysteria decide vaping policy. Banning flavours (as Trump wants to) or banning vaping (as India has) is only going to push people back to much more deadly cigarettes. As long as vaping is safer than smoking (which the current statistics clearly imply) and sale to under-18s is restricted, it should be a welcome alternative to smoking. I applaud Public Health England for its rational and mature approach to e-cigarettes and hope that the hysterical prohibitionist approach in the US does not spread to the UK. Jack Lassados London NW2 True cost of Hinkley Point It’s no surprise that the cost of Hinkley Point power station is expected to double (‘The cost of nuclear power is rising. But EDF is still well insulated”, Business leader). EDF is currently experiencing delays in a similar power project in Flamanville, France, where costs have tripled since the original estimate. But what consumers and taxpayers will ultimately pay is not just the additional cost of bringing Hinkley on line but also the government’s and the utilities’ failure to grasp the speed of change in the renewable energy sector. It may have made sense to opt for a 35-year supply contract at the time of Hinkley’s planning, but recent developments in green energy pricing and technology make this approach obsolete. Wholesale electricity buyers in California now choose much shorter-term contracts because the cost of green power is falling like a stone. As we move towards all-electric economies, the matching of supply and demand is critical. A more Californian mindset on the part of a UK government with, suddenly, a lot more money to spend would prioritise an expansion of wind farms as well as investment in utility-scale batteries, buy-back contracts for electric vehicle owners and central heating via green hydrogen. Could Hinkley Point become an anachronism as soon as it starts generating?

I must confess one luxury: the Guardian and Observer newspapers. But those I pass on to a friend! Jude McGowan London W7 With a Bojo, it’s all relative Thank you John Naughton for your lucid explanation of quantum theory (“We’re a long way from making a quantum leap in web code-breaking”, New Review). This proves our prime minister is, in fact, a subatomic particle – a Bojo. With superposition, as with Schrödinger’s imaginary cat, he can simultaneously be in front of the press and not be in front of the press. His speech can be restrained and racist with no contradiction. But the Bojo’s speciality must be its facility for entanglement, as women around the globe (if not galaxy) can testify. With a Bojo in command, we can wave goodbye to those outdated certainties of truth, honesty and rational discussion. Now, everything is relative and up for grabs.

The National Infrastructure Assessment is a once-a-parliament affair from a body that was created to save us from the deadly combination of politicians’ machismo and the electoral cycle. More prosaically, the National Infrastructure Commission’s job is to inject long-term strategic thinking into the critical business of building important stuff. Its first report contains a devastating conclusion: the government should drop its obsession with building more and more nuclear power stations. The NIC still imagines one more nuclear plant, on top of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, before 2025, but the contrast with the government’s current approach is stark. Energy ministers for a decade have told us that a “resurgence” in new nuclear in the UK is the only way to keep the lights on while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. As for the hideous costs of Hinkley on our energy bills for 35 years, we were told they must be swallowed to get the nuclear show up and running again. Another six plants could be needed, it has been claimed. Sir John Armitt, the NIC’s chairman, has cut through this cultish logic with admirable ease. There is no need to rush with nuclear because “during the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables,” he says. Well, quite. The major development in the energy market in the past decade has been the plunging price of renewables. Costs have been cut faster and further than assumed in Whitehall. In last autumn’s capacity auction, the “strike prices” for two big offshore windfarms came in at £57.50 per megawatt hour and a third at £74.75. These figures – the guaranteed price for the electricity generated – compare to Hinkley’s £92.50. The next generation of nuclear plants really will be cheaper, the industry likes to claim, yet its boasts tend to rely on the assumption that a bigger slice of the construction risks can be shoved on to the government’s balance sheet. Even if such “clever” financing models were deemed desirable, however, they don’t change the basic facts. From a purely financial perspective, offshore wind and solar are the cheapest bets. Some “baseload” nuclear may still be required for security of supply but the NIC’s conclusion merely sounds like common sense: the UK shouldn’t rush to tie itself to an expensive nuclear future; it should back renewables to continue becoming cheaper; and it should see what developments arrive from the world of storage technology, which could change the game again. The government, when it gets back to governing, needs to respond. Its mania for new nuclear plants has looked out-of-date, wrong-headed and unnecessarily expensive for ages. Now even its own infrastructure adviser agrees. A U-turn is required. Can Mothercare win back consumers? A decade ago Mothercare had 425 stores in the UK. By 2014 the figure was 220. Today it is 140 and, on the latest restructuring plan, the group will be down to its last 77 within a year, at which point it will supposedly emerge as a lean and restructured business that is “fit for purpose”, as the interim chairman, Clive Whiley, puts it. His predecessor, Alan Parker, promised the same “sustainable” outcome many times over the years, so shareholders should approach with extreme caution. On the plus side, the latest rejig was accompanied by hard talk about £19m of cost savings from rent reductions, store costs and central overheads as the CVA process is completed. Those savings will plainly help. The missing ingredient, however, is firm evidence that Mothercare can back win consumers in the age of Amazon and stronger competition from supermarkets. The chief executive Mark Newton-Jones’s sermon about “exciting” plans to “revitalise the brand” has also been heard many times. The share price has sunk so low there’s no point in shareholders throwing a tantrum. The £32.5m fundraising, which will double the number of shares in issue, is underwritten, so the company will get its cash whatever happens. But a point to remember is that the company last paid a dividend in 2012. Greater retailing recoveries have happened – but Mothercare’s decline is not new. A flicker of fear over Labour’s nationalisation plans The FTSE 100 index rose 1% on Monday, seemingly ignoring the excitement in Westminster. Look beneath the surface, however, and four of the few fallers were companies in Jeremy Corbyn’s sights. The water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities were down 3% and 2% respectively. National Grid and Royal Mail also shed a little value. One couldn’t call it a shudder of fear among investors over Labour’s nationalisation plans – but it was a flicker of worry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:23:33Z","webTitle":"Exposing UK government folly of investment in new nuclear | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Exposing UK government folly of investment in new nuclear","bodyText":"In 1976, Lord Flowers pronounced that there should be no further commitment to nuclear energy unless it could be demonstrated that long-lived highly radioactive wastes could be safely contained for the indefinite future. Ever since, efforts to find a suitable site for a geological disposal facility have been rejected by communities (Wanted: community willing to host a highly radioactive waste dump in their district, 22 January). There is, therefore, little evidence to support the government’s claim that “it is satisfied that effective arrangements will exist to manage and dispose of the waste that will be produced from new nuclear power stations”. Deep disposal may be the eventual long-term solution but demonstrating a safety case, finding suitable geology and a willing community are tough challenges and likely to take a long time. The search for a disposal site diverts attention from the real solution for the foreseeable future, which is to ensure the safe and secure management of the unavoidable legacy wastes that have to be managed. It is perverse to compound the problem by a new-build programme that will result in vastly increased radioactivity from spent fuel and other highly radioactive wastes which will have to be stored indefinitely at vulnerable sites scattered around our coasts. A new-build programme would create an unmanageable and intolerable burden on communities into the far future. To suggest that a repository is the solution is in the realm of fantasy. Prof Andrew Blowers Member of the first Committee on Radioactive Waste Management • The fact that the UK government is still going ahead with plans to construct new power stations, generating even more toxic radioactive waste, troubles and puzzles me immensely. Here, on the beautiful isle of Anglesey, where tidal, solar and wind energy production are all highly feasible alternatives and could also provide opportunities for well-paid employment, politicians appear to be happy for an area of outstanding natural beauty to be contaminated for further than the foreseeable future, not to mention the immense eyesore that will occupy acres of fertile land. It is an eye-wateringly costly venture that many fear will expose taxpayers to huge financial risk and will also leave future generations guarding the threat to their environment and health long after it ceases to function. Future generations will doubtless wonder, when most of Europe is shutting down its nuclear power stations and not planning any more, why in the world the local population didn’t protest harder.

Sanders takes on ‘pathological liar’ and ‘racist’ Trump Bernie Sanders has surged to the front of the Democratic pack after joining the crowded race for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination on Tuesday. The 77-year-old independent senator from Vermont raised $4m from 150,000 donors in the first 12 hours following his campaign launch, and in an interview with Vermont public radio he chose to take the fight directly to Donald Trump, calling the president a “pathological liar … a racist, a sexist, a homophobe [and] a xenophobe”.

Trump administration demands California rail billions The frosty relationship between the Trump White House and California’s Democratic leadership has been further cooled by a spat over funding for the Golden State’s controversial, costly high-speed rail project. A week after Governor Gavin Newsom said in his state of the state address that the $77bn project, “as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long” – and Trump described it as a “disaster” – the US Department of Transportation has announced plans to cancel $929m in federal grant funds for the railway. Money back. The transportation department also said it was “exploring legal options” to seek the return of $2.5bn previously granted to California for the project. Flame war. Trump tweeted demanding the return of “three and a half billion dollars”. Newsom responded that the money had been “allocated by Congress for this project.

Meteorologists said temperatures would reach or even exceed 40C from Spain to Switzerland as hot air was sucked up from the Sahara by the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe. High humidity meant it would feel like 47C, experts warned. “El infierno [hell] is coming,” tweeted the TV meteorologist Silvia Laplana in Spain, where the AEMET weather service forecast temperatures of 42C by Thursday in the Ebro, Tagus, Guadiana and Guadalquivir valleys and warned of an “extreme risk” of forest fires. In France, officials in Paris set up “cool rooms” in municipal buildings, opened pools for late-night swimming and installed extra drinking fountains as temperatures in the capital reached 34C on Monday and were forecast to climb further later in the week. “I’m worried about people who are downplaying this, who are continuing to exercise as usual or stay out in the sun,” the health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said. “This affects all of us, nobody is a superman when it comes to dealing with the extreme heat we’re going to see on Thursday and Friday,” she told a press conference. Emmanuel Demaël of Météo-France said the heatwave was unprecedented “because it’s hitting so early in June – we haven’t seen this since 1947.” Record monthly and all-time highs were likely to be set in several parts of the country, Demaël predicted, and night-time temperatures were unlikely to fall below 20C. School exams were postponed until next week, charities distributed water to homeless people and sales of fans quadrupled. France’s deadliest recent heatwave was in August 2003, when almost 15,000 mainly elderly people died as hospitals were overwhelmed. In Italy, “the most intense heatwave in a decade” was under way, with hospitals preparing to deal with a wave of heat-related illnesses and the health ministry suggesting army doctors may be needed to counter a shortage of medics. Highs of 37C to 40C were forecast across the north and centre, including in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Milan and Turin, with several Italian cities expected to set new records for the highest ever June temperatures. Authorities in Rome warned of the health risk from uncollected rubbish piled up on the capital’s streets, and eight tourists – including a Briton – were fined €450 (£403) each on Sunday for cooling off in the city’s fountains. Sabine Krüger of the German state meteorological service, DWD, said the June record of 38.2C, set in Frankfurt in 1947, was likely to be beaten by the middle or end of this week, with 100 hours of sunshine forecast before Friday, temperatures in Frankfurt set to reach 39C or even 40C by Wednesday and Berlin predicted to swelter in 37C. DWD on Monday warned citizens to take extra precaution in view of the extreme heat and high UV radiation over the coming days: “Avoid staying outdoors for long periods between 11am and 3pm,” it said, adding that sunblock, sunglasses and a sun hat were advisable even in the shade. Animal protection groups also warned pet owners to avoid leaving dogs or cats in cars unattended. The heatwave comes after storms and record rainfall caused major problems in parts of Bavaria this weekend, with the Munich fire brigade called out 50 times and flights into and out of Munich airport suspended on Saturday evening. In Switzerland, MeteoSwiss issued a “severe danger” level four heat alert for several parts of the country, warning of temperatures in excess of 33C and reaching 37C or even 39C in some places from Tuesday until Thursday. A number of all-time highs were likely to be recorded, it said. Even Scandinavia looks unlikely to be spared, with parts of southern Denmark and Sweden predicted to reach 30C by Tuesday – and to feel more like a thoroughly un-Scandinavian 35C, the Danish broadcaster TV2 said. Longer range weather forecasts show summer temperatures throughout July and August are expected to be higher than normal this year, rivalling those of 2018, which according to the European Environment Agency was one of the three warmest years on record on the continent. Scientists have said last year’s heatwave, which led to increased mortality rates, a dramatic decline in crop yields, the shutdown of nuclear power plants and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was linked to the climate emergency. Meteorologists warn that such heatwaves are likely to become more frequent even if countries succeed in their commitments to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C as part of the 2015 Paris climate accord. The EU has pledged to cut carbon emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Here are some of the highlights: The leaders’ debate: It was a ratings winner, but make sure you check out our factcheck. Prime minister Scott Morrison made defence announcements (or reannouncements?) today. Meanwhile, his party should get a boost after the United Australia party jiggled its preferences. Labor leader Anthony Albanese visited three states in one day, and announced hospital funding for South Australia. Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie won’t say whether her team will block any more ambitious climate policy. Those petrol price cuts? They’re already being whittled down. There were harrowing toilet tales (and no, nothing to do with the loo on the Morrison campaign bus). Prepolls have opened – here’s everything you need to know about how it workds. Queensland faces more flood danger. See you back here tomorrow afternoon, after Amy Remeikis shepherds you through the main part of the day. The Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, has chosen to appear on Sky News to repeat some of her earlier comments: First Dog on the Moon: It’s gotten so bad even Guardian columnists are allowed to swear now. Now for something different! And it’s happening right about now ... As independents challenge the major parties in safe seats across the country, former Indi MP Cathy McGowan joins Gabrielle Chan to discuss the state of play in rural electorates in the 2022 campaign and what it might mean for politics in the next decade. We will going live straight into the event page and onto our Guardian Australia Facebook page. And here’s the livestream. Here are some more details on the flood danger in Queensland, from Caitlin Cassidy. Stay safe, everyone! Earlier, Paul Karp factchecked the leaders’ debate. One of the biggest clangers? Prime minister Scott Morrison’s claim he blew the whistle on neglect in aged care. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation says the claim is “not only astonishing, it’s offensive”. The federation’s chief executive, Annie Butler, says aged care nurses and workers have been campaigning to fix the crisis “for years”, but were ignored: It was only following the shocking expose on aged care by Four Corners that the prime minister finally acted – not to fix the problems in the sector but to, yet again, ‘kick the can down the road’ by calling a royal commission into safety and quality in aged care. The government has had almost a decade to address the worsening situation in aged care. It has failed to deliver. And here are some images from Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s day (including another gratuitous dog): The ABC’s Raf Epstein asked the Australian Electoral Commission how the prepoll numbers were going. Quite a jump from last election: Some snaps on the trail of prime minister Scott Morrison today, thanks to AAP: Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin have taken a look at the whirls and eddies of preference flows: Josh Butler’s election briefing is in. He takes a look at the leaders’ moves today, the biggest issues, the fallout from the debate – including that surprise admission from prime minister Scott Morrison: 7,516 Covid deaths in Australia: Spotted: One Alan Tudge. Cait Kelly finds out what the elusive minister has been up to: The Australian dollar today dipped below 70 US cents for the first time since late January, testing a level that it’s nudged a couple of times in the past 20 months. The falling dollar reflects expectations the US federal reserve, that country’s central bank, will be more aggressive in lifting interest rates than the Reserve Bank of Australia at least in the near term. (Investors move money to where they hope to get a better return.) A gauge of six major currencies shows the US currency is now at its highest since 2002, Reuters said. So it’s not just an Australian thing. Still, the Aussie dollar is supported by the fact the country happens to be a big exporter in commodities that are both in high demand and priced in US dollars. And as Westpac said this afternoon: Last week Australia reported its 51st consecutive monthly trade surplus. Coal prices are on the rise again though metals prices have wobbled somewhat as China’s Covid lockdowns continue. Still, a weaker Australian dollar means Australia will import more inflation, and increases the odds the RBA will have to hike the cash rate faster too. Fuel will be among goods that will be more costly as the Aussie dollar slips. (As noted in an earlier post, investors are predicting the RBA’s cash rate will rise from 0.35% after last week’s board meeting to 1% as soon as its July gathering.) While a weaker local dollar isn’t great if you were planning to visit a country where their currency is pegged to the US dollar, there are other attractive places to go. For instance, the Japanese yen has been particularly weak versus the greenback for months, while the Aussie dollar also rose above NZ$1.10 last week for the first time since August 2020, Westpac said. Today’s Campaign catchup has dropped! Katharine Murphy is on the mic with Jane Lee, talking about the shouty debate, and the whispers to prepoll voters: Looks like the short-term sugar hit isn’t helping with those spikes: Asked about her climate change policies, Tink says Australia needs to move faster to cut emissions, and that her target is a “60% reduction by 2030 and then to get to net zero by 2040”. In terms of the mechanisms, and the phasing out of fossil fuels, she says she’ll listen to the scientists, economists and experts on that. Independent candidate for North Sydney, Kylea Tink, is now talking to Greg Jennett. He’s asked her about former prime minister John Howard’s comments that independents are “anti-Liberal groupies”. She says: I think what is very clear is that when you have a system that is working really well between the two major parties, neither will have a vested interest for seeing any change brought into the system. I think what is really interesting is to hear comments like that coming from a former prime minister, who I am sure during his time as prime minister prided himself on his capacity to listen to communities and work to develop forward facing legislative reform. The reality is, there is no teal movement, in fact my campaign has always been pink, just as I know [independent member for Indi] Helen Haines has always been orange. This is the rise of a new way of doing politics and it has been driven by communities that are frustrated and don’t want to put up with the poor political behaviour we have seen emerging over the last decade and the lack of advancement for our country. Former Liberal MP Christopher Pyne is talking to the ABC’s Fran Kelly – she brings up that time he famously said the party’s moderates were now in the “winner’s circle”. Kelly says prime minister Scott Morrison seems to be giving the moderates “grief” now, particularly over LGBTQ issues: Pyne: “I feel like I’m in the winner’s circle, especially on Afternoon Briefing with the ABC.” Kelly: “That a boy!” Pyne: “The truth is Scott Morrison is not trying to damage any of his colleagues.” On a possible Nick Xenophon comeback in South Australia, Hanson-Young says she didn’t see people picking up his how-to-vote cards earlier today, and slips in a swift spruik for Greens Senate candidate Barbara Pocock. The leader of the Greens should be involved, Hanson-Young says, but adds that is not her main motivation: My primary motivation is making sure the public get access to the views, the ideas, that insight into what the democracy can deliver for them. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is talking to the ABC’s Greg Jennett about last night’s debate – as Amy Remeikis reported earlier, she says Australia needs an independent debate commission after the “unseemly squabble”. It’s a “damn shame” the ABC isn’t hosting a debate, she says, adding it would need legislation: I think it would have to be a piece of legislation in the first instance. It would allow for the establishment of an independent debates commission. Who is on that and how that board or commission is selected is up for discussion. It’s really to get this out of the hands of political parties and politicians on the eve of an election. Other countries do this. They have independently agreed, monitored and implemented debates for their elections. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, surprised no one when his first visit to South Australia (except for an unscheduled pit stop on his plane) was to Boothby. There’s a bit of conjecture that the marginal seat, held by retiring Liberal MP Nicolle Flint, is the only interesting one in the state. But some insiders are also hopeful (on the Labor side) or worried (on the Liberal side) that Christopher Pyne’s old seat of Sturt could flip. The seat, which is considered fairly safe Liberal territory, is currently held by James Stevens. There’s some buzz around today about Grey, too, which is held by Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey (and now I’m going to share my own tweet, which seems indulgent, sorry): Anyhoo, if you haven’t read it yet, here’s Sarah Martin’s profile of Boothby (which is, still, the most likely to fall to Labor): Gratuitous dog content: This is utterly appalling: “Dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding” could hit Queensland from tomorrow, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. AAP reports there are alerts for Longreach, Winton, Cloncurry, Isisford, Barcaldine, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and Blackall. The BoM says up to 150mm of rain could hit parts of central-west Queensland: Locally intense rainfall with embedded thunderstorms which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible for the central-west and parts of the north-west districts. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre has run the ruler over the main parties’ policies: This morning, Australian fashion’s peak body launched what they’re calling a world-first initiative, a trademark certifying Australian clothes. The Australian Fashion Council (AFC) is likening the trademark to a Tourism Australia campaign, but for fashion. The trademark is the result of $1m in federal funding, from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. To qualify for an Australia Fashion Trademark, brands do not have to manufacture in Australia. At the trademark’s launch this morning, The AFC chief executive, Leila Naja Hibri, said when she was asked to attend a government crisis meeting on Australian fashion manufacturing in early 2020, she asked: “What manufacturing?” Brands registering for the Australian Fashion Trademark will have to meet two of four criteria: Australian made (for at least 50% of garments certified); Australian majority employees (75% of a brand’s employees must be based in Australia); Australian-owned (also 75%); and Australian tax domiciled. The certification process will also require brands to make commitments around transparency, and social and environmental responsibility. Commitment to “authentic Australian design” is also a requirement, and this includes a specific clause stating brands must “omit any cultural appropriation in the design process”. The trademark eligibility criteria, published today, are relatively strict. This is intentional on the part of the fashion council, who hope to capture ethically conscious consumers through the certification scheme. Hibri described the criteria as “prioritising people and planet, as well as profit”. The launch was targeted specifically to the fashion industry, who are being encourage to apply for the trademark. Domestic and international marketing initiatives around the trademark and qualifying brands are planned for later in the year. The trademark is just the start of a $69m funding ask by the AFC, outlined in a report produced by Ernst &amp; Young, which was also released today. “It’s not more than the government is doing for other sectors,” Hibri said. “Australia has been great at selling wine and tourism,” she said, outlining fashion’s potential to deliver significant economic growth, and more jobs, particularly for women, who make up 77% of the sector. Support for Australia’s beleaguered TCF manufacturing sector makes up the biggest slice of the report’s funding suggestions, including $10m to integrate fibre and derivatives into existing manufacturing strategies; $10m to prioritise the procurement of locally made uniforms for the defence force and federal police, and a further $6.75m to develop a grant scheme focused around Australian made procurement strategies for businesses. Politics isn’t a frequent topic of discussion at Australian fashion week, but when Hibri said that she looks forward to working with “the next Australian government” it drew stifled murmurs from the room. Early voting centres across the country opened today for those unable to vote on 21 May, and many voters have not wasted any time in heading to their local ballot to cast their vote. In the marginal seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east, a queue of voters spilled out from the prepoll centre on Oxfords Street in Bondi Junction onto the footpath. The seat is held by Liberal MP Dave Sharma on a margin of 1.3%, and the desperation in both his and his challenger’s – teal independent Allegra Spender – campaign was on display. Both candidates were handing out how to vote material and talking to voters on Monday. In a sign of just how close this seat is, Sharma approached and engaged voters identifying and holding Greens material while waiting to vote. Bondi Junction local Malcolm Smith was one voter who was not swayed by the tens of corflutes and volunteers handing out for Spender and Sharma – the self-described “crypto hound” voted for United Australia party candidate Natalie Dumer, but preferenced Sharma above Spender. He said: The other parties let us down over the past two and half years, so I had to give it to somebody outside of the two-party system. I never thought I’d actually vote for Clive Palmer or someone like Pauline Hanson, but I just don’t think we’ve been able to have discussions about Covid. Meanwhile, Paddington local Petra O’Neill cast her vote for Spender. O’Neill voted for Sharma at the 2019 election, but said prime minister Scott Morrison’s absence during the black summer bushfires and record on climate action has swayed her vote. She said: I voted for Allegra, but she comes from a very privileged background. I don’t think she’s had as much experience as say, Zali Steggall, but the Liberals have done absolutely nothing for us, I have no faith in ScoMo. Be excellent to each other, Gilmore candidate Andrew Constance says ... the day after the debate the night before ... Lake Burley Griffin has been heritage listed, AAP reports. About 6,640 hectares including the lake and adjacent land in Canberra will be added to the commonwealth heritage list. The National Capital Authority says the area “possesses outstanding creative, technical and aesthetic heritage values for the nation as a whole” and is “an iconic cultural landscape”. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: The construction and completion of Lake Burley Griffin demonstrates the push for national development during the years immediately after federation and before the first world war, and again after the second world war, under the Menzies government. The lake’s design reflects the influence of three major urban design movements including the City Beautiful movement, the Garden City movement and International Modernism. More dire warnings from the aged care sector this morning. I’ve spoken with the chief executive of BaptistCare NSW and ACT, Charles Moore, who has warned workforce shortages and underfunding are exhausting his staff and driving the sector into an “untenable standstill”. Moore is pleading with whichever party forms government to act immediately to improve aged care funding, warning the current pressures are unsustainable and are hitting vulnerable residents as well as staff. Moore said: Workforce shortages are exhausting our staff and many hard-working people in the sector are barely able to keep up with the cost of living, with inflation rising to a point that’s more than twice the rate of wages growth. Our sector is underfunded and falling into an untenable standstill. It’s impacting both our workers and the most vulnerable in our society, and voters are seeing this too. BaptistCare has also released polling it commissioned on voters’ attitudes to aged care funding and staff pay, conducted by YouGov. It found Australians ranked aged care workers behind only hospital workers in terms of who should be paid the highest. The overwhelming majority of voters said there were important actions the incoming government should take with respect to the aged care sector, with increasing funding the most important, according to the poll. More than 640,000 people subjected themselves to last night’s leaders’ debate. Considering it was a “shambles”, that’s impressive engagement. Elias Visontay and Amanda Meade report: After that rush of press conferences, here’s a nice little historical tidbit for you: And that’s his visit to South Australia done, by the sound of it. Albanese says he has one more state to squeeze in today. Albanese tells jousting journos to play “rock, paper, scissors” to see who gets the next question. The winner asks about comments from former prime minister John Howard, who said Australia will need a nuclear power industry to service the planned nuclear-powered submarines. Albanese says: I think Mr Howard’s wrong. And, indeed, the advice and part of the decision-making process in the briefings that we had about Aukus – that included Senator Wong and Richard Marles and Brendan O’Connor – were that you didn’t need a domestic civil nuclear industry in order to support the nuclear submarines. We made very clear our support for nuclear subs. We made that on the basis of the advice that we received. And we stand by it. Albanese also brings up the situation with Liberal National candidate for Lilley, Vivian Lobo: Because I’m not sure he’s been asked, but I do want to say that the prime minister needs to do more to respond to the referral of the candidate for Lilley to the Australian Federal Police by the Australian Electoral Commission. This is a really serious issue and the prime minister needs to respond as to what action he will take on this issue. If you missed it earlier, here’s Tamsin Rose’s story on Lobo: Labor’s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, is asked about the GST arrangements by which Western Australia has a guaranteed “floor” amount – something that has made the other states cranky. Labor wouldn’t “revisit” that deal, Chalmers says: There’s a deal that’s been done between the commonwealth and the states, which we have said in all of the capital cities right around Australia that we intend to honour. We totally understand, whether it’s premier Malinauskas or other premiers of both political persuasions around Australia, their job is to advocate for the best deal that they can get. And our job is to weigh that all up. But we’ve made it very clear – Anthony has, I have – that we don’t intend to revisit the current deal. Wong is talking now – she’s asked about that report this morning of another draft agreement between Solomon Islands and China, one which mentions planned infrastructure. Wong says it’ll take a “lot of work” to address the issues in the Pacific: If it’s true, it demonstrates the seriousness of what has occurred on Mr Morrison’s watch. It also demonstrates that the sort of tough words he’s talking about, or trying to use, about “red lines”, don’t appear, if the reports are correct, to be the way forward, or appear to have much effect. What we have to do is to work with the whole Pacific family, the whole Pacific family. Q: So it’s just a coincidence that you’re pumping money into a hospital in a marginal seat? Albanese says “it’s needed right now”. He also says Labor will have more to say on health, when asked if his team would look at the funding split between the state and federal governments. Q: Is this a “naked use” of money in an election campaign, and wouldn’t systemic reform be better? “The states run the health system,” Albanese says, adding that this project was chosen “based on priorities”: What I am planning to do, though, is to sit down constructively with all state governments, based on their priorities. He says he and Malinauskas spoke before the state election (which Malinauskas won at quite a trot), and: If we’re successful, one of the first things I will do is to convene a meeting with state premiers and chief ministers – I want to work with all of them. And state premiers are in the best position on the ground to say what their priorities for service delivery are. This project is an important project. Thanks, Amy Remeikis! And hello, all. I have a debate hangover but will soldier on. I am going to hand over the blog to our SA expert Tory Shepherd to take you through. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning – take care of you Ax Peter Malinauskas gets the second question as well. He has Penny Wong and Anthony Albanese standing behind him The South Australian Labor premier ,Peter Malinauskas, has headline billing in this second press conference, in Boothby – which Labor is hoping to *finally* take from the Liberals. I think the Liberal party in South Australia for too long and certainly the federal Coalition, has take then seat for granted. It’s neglected the principal concerns that residents in this community want and the number one thing on the minds of constituents in the southern suburbs including in Boothby is a health system that works a state Labor government partnering with a federal government, we will deliver far more outcomes. The announcement is for a $400m upgrade to the Flinders hospital. Malinauskas gets the first question. I just keep coming back to this from Scott Morrison’s most recent press conference: Businesses can make wages go up. When businesses are doing well and when unemployment is going down, then wages go up. That is how it works. That is exactly what the Reserve Bank governor was saying. When he was noting that wage rises are starting to happen now, we have been waiting for them for some time, we have seen unemployment under our government come from 5.7%, down to 4%, which is the equal lowest level in 48 years. Youth unemployment, which is incredibly important here, has gone to 8.3%. That is the lowest level since August of 2008. Young people in apprenticeships just like this, all around the country getting into jobs. Businesses in a weak economy will not be able to afford wage rises. Businesses in a strong economy, that is a whole different story. Businesses in an economy where unemployment is falling as the Reserve Bank governor said to 3.5%, that is what can support wage rises. There is no magic pen from Anthony Albanese that makes your wages go up. There is no law you pass that makes your wages go up. What makes wages go up is a strong economy where businesses are doing well and they can ensure that they can pay staff even better and above award rates which we see in so many companies across the country. Australia’s economy, as Grogs has pointed out on multiple occasions, was in trouble *before the pandemic*. Wages in real terms have non-risen since before the last election (the last time we were all talking about this and Mathias Cormann said it was a deliberate feature of the economic architecture to fight inflation, which was already very low). So what does that say about the economy under the Morrison government? Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Monday, as the country records three deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 812 In hospital: 72 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 3 Cases: 7,793 In hospital: 1,548 (with 54 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: Cases: 202 In hospital: 38 (with 0 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 0 Cases: 4,750 In hospital: 439 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,984 In hospital: 228 (with 10 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 841 In hospital: 44 (with 1 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 0 Cases: 10,031 In hospital: 491 (with 43 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 10,394 In hospital: 279 (with 6 people in ICU) The Weekly Times is holding an online crossbench debate this evening: The Weekly Times and the NFF will host an online roundtable debate between regional crossbench MPs Bob Katter (Kennedy, QLD), Helen Haines (Indi, VIC) and Rebekha Sharkie (Mayo, SA) tonight at 8pm AEST. Watch the debate LIVE on The Weekly Times website (video to appear at this link from 8pm). You can see Scott Morrison’s strategy there. He is now talking about what could happen if Australia “drops its economic shield” and votes Labor, as well as working as hard as he can to discredit Labor’s policy announcements. There was a lot to factcheck in those statements, but as a general overview, Labor’s housing shared equity scheme works like ones which have been established in other jurisdictions, including WA for three decades. If you begin earning over the scheme’s equity cap, the government does not sell your house – you have two years to buy out the equity share. Morrison also said that will make your mortgage grow by $250,000/$300,000 if you buy out the government, which is true – but you would not have been able to afford the house in the first place without the government’s equity scheme and if you are earning over the cap, you are better-placed to be approved for the mortgage you wanted in the first place. On Labor’s transmission scheme, it will be an independent panel who decides which projects are needed, so it’s not a willy-nilly process. No matter who wins the election, there will be an aged care and health care staffing shortage which will need to be addressed. The stage three tax cuts are legislated and Labor (in the end) supported the legislation’s passage through the parliament. Wage growth in Australia has been at historic lows (in real terms) for the past decade. Q: Opinion polls suggest that Labor has gained ground since the RBA rate rise. The Coalition’s vote has deteriorated along with your personal approval rating. Why do you think this is happening at this stage of the race? Scott Morrison: There is two weeks to go and a choice is going to be made. Right now, today ... Q: Why do you think voters are marking you down? Morrison: Voters are turning up to vote in pre-poll right now. They are making a choice right now and over the course of this campaign, people are making assessments and so many, as we are seeing, are still to make a decision over the next couple of weeks. I said at the rally yesterday, if you looked at this election campaign as if it were a job interview, let’s look at what Anthony Albanese has done through this campaign. If you are having a job interview and you ask them: there is something you need to know about the economy if you want to run it – what is the unemployment rate? What is the cash rate? Didn’t know. His aged care policy will shut down aged care facilities across the country because he doesn’t know how to get the nurses. His health care policy, he said was costed, but it was uncosted. The reporter tries to interject and say they were asking about what he is going to do, but Morrison ploughs on: ... He couldn’t understand what his own policy, putting forward on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, he couldn’t explain that to you. That doesn’t sound like a person who deserves a second interview, let alone the job. Australians are needing to make that decision. They will make that decision and I have submitted myself freely and openly and happily because that is the democracy in which we live so Australians can make that choice. It is a real choice. On Wednesday night we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues even more. As Australians go to the polls, they are starting to focus on the choice that they have to make and it is a choice between strength, a strong economy and a weaker one under Labor. It is a choice about a government that you do know, and an economic plan that is working and can support Australians and provide that economic shield into the future, or a Labor party that is still – less than two weeks away [from the election], and they are yet to articulate an economic plan. They are yet to submit one policy to the costings process, and they have $50 billion in unexplained debt they are putting on the balance sheet which they are yet to fully explain to Australians, and they will have higher deficits. It is a choice between Anthony Albanese and his inability to manage money ... Q: But they are choosing him – why? Morrison [acting like he didn’t hear]: ... And we have demonstrated strength on economic policy and national security policy that is keeping Australians safe, and keeping Australians together, in some of the most difficult times we have ever had to manage as a country, and it is keeping our economy strong. Thank you. Q: On a local project, last week the government announced $85 million for the Mineldra plant on the Shoalhaven, that was announced and I can’t figure out whether it is equity or debt – Mr Constance may want to comment – and the boss is a donor to the Liberal party. Don’t there need to be safeguards about what the money is for – I can’t figure out whether it is debt or equity. Will taxpayers get that money back? Scott Morrison gives this question to Andrew Constance, who is his candidate (not a minister). Constance says: It is a $85 million announcement to reduce carbon emissions out of the Shoalhaven’s largest employer by 300,000 tonnes a year. The Liberals and Nationals get on with dealing with emissions with this type of investment. It is towards a capital contribution towards the cogeneration plant which is ... ... It is a contribution to dealing with getting Australia to net zero emissions. To reduce emissions by 45%, generating hundreds of jobs here in the Shoalhaven, right decision to be made, absolutely the right decision to be made given the incredible product that is produced by Minildra in terms of the circular economy. That was the investment that was announced. Albo turned up there and didn’t announce anything. He turned up and just stood there. Q: That announcement is going to come regardless of who is elected. Constance: 300,000 tonnes of carbon emissions being reduced here in the Shoalhaven by our largest employer is worthy of support. Q: Can you make wages go up? [What is your plan?] Scott Morrison: Businesses can make wages go up. When businesses are doing well and when unemployment is going down, then wages go up. That is how it works*. That is exactly what the Reserve Bank governor was saying. When he was noting that wage rises are starting to happen now, we have been waiting for them for some time, we have seen unemployment under our government come from 5.7%, down to 4%, which is the equal lowest level in 48 years. Youth unemployment, which is incredibly important here, has gone to 8.3%. That is the lowest level since August of 2008. Young people in apprenticeships just like this, all around the country getting into jobs. Businesses in a weak economy will not be able to afford wage rises. Businesses in a strong economy, that is a whole different story**. Businesses in an economy where unemployment is falling as the Reserve Bank governor said to 3.5%, that is what can support wage rises. There is no magic pen from Anthony Albanese that makes your wages go up. There is no law you pass that makes your wages go up. What makes wages go up is a strong economy where businesses are doing well and they can ensure that they can pay staff even better and above award rates which we see in so many companies across the country ... ... The other thing we are doing is keeping electricity prices down ... Putting downward pressure on electricity prices, and I would say also downward pressure on rising inflation and downward pressure on rising interest rates. When you compare Australia to the rest of the world, we are at 5.1% for inflation. Much higher than any of us would like. Across the ditch in New Zealand it is almost 7%. Same in Canada. Go to the United States and it is 8.5%. Interest rates here, 0.35%. You go across the ditch and it went up by 125 basis points and 90 in the UK and 75 basis points in Canada and the United States. Our economic shield, which was the question, is proving very effective when you compare what is happening in other countries. You take that shield down with the election of a Labor government and you will feel the same pressures that are being felt in other advanced economies. *There has been stagnant wage growth for the last decade, when the Coalition has been in power **Given the lack of real wage growth in the last three years, has the economy been weak or strong? Q: [Alan Tudge didn’t register a] property transfer in 2018 for six months. What happened, and is he in breach of the ministerial code? Scott Morrison: No, he’s not, he updated those arrangements consistent with the code. They were late on the other registers. He is in compliance. Q: Prime minister, a leaked version of an MOU between Beijing and Solomons to corporate on building wharves and maritime infrastructure emerged. Is Australia aware that was being negotiated? How can we be sure it won’t ultimately be used by the Chinese military? Is this a further erosion of the trust between our government and the Solomons if they are negotiating further deals with Beijing that are only being known about by being leaked? Scott Morrison: We’re very aware of what the Chinese government’s ambitions are in the Pacific, whether it be in relation to facilities such as that or naval bases or other presence of their military in the Pacific. They’re doing this all around the world. I don’t think there’s any great secret about that. We are very aware of what’s happening in our region and of the pressures there are that the Chinese government is seeking to put on countries across our region. As I mentioned many times, there are 19 Pacific Island countries within the Pacific Islands Forum and so that is a broad family that we must work with, and do all the time, to ensure that we’re seeking to protect not just Australia’s national interest, but the point I was making last night, I don’t believe it’s in the Solomon Islands’ national interest. That is ultimately a matter for the people of the Solomon Islands. I am very concerned, as many other Pacific leaders are, about the interference and intrusion of the Chinese government into these types of arrangements and what that can mean for the peace, stability and security of the south-west Pacific. That is why the Pacific step-up is in place. That is why we have lifted our overseas development assistance to $1.85 billion a year, why we have been investing heavily in the infrastructure, particularly communications and energy infrastructure, across the Pacific Islands regions and that is why we’ve been supporting them in every health crisis they’ve had, whether it was Covid, or whether it was measles, up in Samoa or the humanitarian crisis we moved so quickly to be over in Tonga to support the people there. The first call when these things happen in our region, from any of our Pacific family, is to Australia. That remains the case. Indeed, Australian federal police remain on the ground in Honiara now. Q: On John Howard’s comments yesterday. He said the Aukus deal would make it inevitable we would have a civil nuclear industry. Do you agree? If not, why not? Scott Morrison: No, I don’t think that is inevitable. That’s not the basis of the decision ... the fact we were able to go forward with nuclear-powered submarines without having a civil nuclear industry was one of the key changes that enabled us to go forward with the agreement itself. Previously, that had been a requirement – and one of the key technology changes in the development of nuclear-powered submarines that we work through, particularly with the United States, over that long 18-month period, was it didn’t require such a civil nuclear capability to go forward with the acquisition of that fleet. So, I see the issues as separate. Q: A question about regional news. We can’t wait for a green paper to be delivered and $10 million won’t fix the issues we have in our regions. Scott Morrison: Print media or broadcast? Q: Regional broadcast media. Morrison: As you know, there is a package for print media ... Reporter: I understand that ... Can you just wait for the rest of my question? Morrison: Sorry. Q: The rest is, will you scrap spectrum fees and support anti-siphoning laws? If you don’t, our regional newsroom will also crumble. Morrison: First of all, when it comes to regional print media, we have a package in place and the reason that was put in place was because of the massive escalation in printing costs. That would have driven regional newspapers out of business. So the communications minister worked with the industry to ensure that we can provide that support to keep the regional print titles in place, and I’m pleased we’re able to do that. Regional print media and indeed broad cast, plays an important role in local communities. It shouldn’t just be the ABC. I think it is important there are other commercial opportunities and voices out there, providing regional news across Australia. In the terms of spectrum, I know they’re under consideration by the communications minister. On the issue of siphoning, we addressed that last night. The Labor party and the Coalition had the same policy for review of that after the election. Q: Prime Minister, in 2018, Senator Rex Patrick said he obtained a defence study that revealed Newcastle, Brisbane, Port Kembla scored poorly in accommodating a subs base. The best was Sydney, followed by Jervis Bay – the residents are concerned a subs base might be there one day. Can you rule out that as a site? Scott Morrison: I can, it’s not one of the shortlisted sites at all. Q: You’ve both been pretty heavily criticised for the way you behaved in the debate, particularly the treatment, pretty dismissive, of the female moderator. In hindsight, do you wish you’d acted differently? Scott Morrison: Well, I think the way the debate was set up made it often very difficult to hear in the room itself. It was a spirited debate. I think Australians expect spirited debate and the last one was a bit more measured. I hope the one on Wednesday, well, the way the rules work, maybe that will help the moderator a bit more on that occasion. It was a debate. It’s a spirited debate. There’s an election [campaign on]. The reporter asks about it being a woman being spoken over. Morrison says: I don’t think gender had anything to do with it, frankly. I don’t believe gender had anything to do with it. I’m surprised why it would. Both Anthony and I think are completely respectful, have always been respectful of females in the workplace and certainly when we work professionally with them in an environment like. That – I don’t think it would have made, I don’t think it had any bearing on that issue at all. Now Scott Morrison is criticising Labor’s “help to buy” policy which he calls “forced to sell”. This sounds like all the points he wanted to make in the debate and didn’t get an opportunity to. That’s why Australians are really asking the question about whether this job is too big for [Albanese] and whether he’s up for it. Perhaps sensing that he won’t get asked anything in the press conference where he can raise this, Scott Morrison extends his press conference spiel to include this: Now, before I go to questions, let me make a couple of points about last night’s debate. It was a pretty spirited debate, I’m sure everybody will agree. These are passionate topics, this is a big choice – future of the country, future of our economy, the ability to pay for important services like Medicare, aged care, all of these things. Plenty of people can talk about the problems – the leader of the opposition, Anthony Albanese, did a lot of talking about the problems last night – but we didn’t hear any solutions. You can talk about aged care, talk about Medicare, you can talk about childcare, but he didn’t tell you the childcare policy cost $63 billion. You can’t go and make commitments like that if you don’t have an economy that can pay for it. He goes on to criticise Labor’s power policy and Anthony Albanese’s refusal to guarantee wage growth. The PM is back in the Labor-held marginal seat of Gilmore, and it’s all about defence spending: When I became prime minister three and a half years ago, I said that I wanted to keep our economy strong. I said I wanted to keep Australians safe and I wanted to keep Australians together. That has been our challenge over the last three years, particularly as we’ve come through Covid. Keeping the economy strong means we can do the other things that are so important. Australia’s national security doesn’t happen by accident. It requires a government that understands it, is deeply committed to it and is prepared to make the decisions to enhance our capability and give our defence forces the support they need. Paul Karp has taken a look at the five biggest clangers in the latest leaders’ debate: The attorney general is waving a corflute on the side of the road. This is good, considering the number of cases in Queensland: This was Scott Morrison’s response to Sussan Ley’s non-answer during a weekend press conference: Q: Prime minister, your own cabinet minister, Sussan Ley, yesterday she was saying that she wasn’t focused on what happens after the election and she’s not looking to advocate what the Coalition would do in government should you get re-elected. So what are you hiding from voters until after the election? Morrison: Absolutely nothing. Q: And that was in relation – Morrison: I mean, the budget contained over 200 specific measures. Q: Her comments were in relation to religious discrimination. Morrison: ... that all set out what our agenda is. And over the course of this election, we’ve been setting out policies each and every day. Now, the Labor party hasn’t been doing that. They’ve had three years. We’ve done three budgets since the last election and we’ve announced more policy in this election than Mr Albanese has even attempted to do. Q: Sussan Ley’s response was in relation to religious discrimination amendments specifically. Morrison: So we have a Labor party with Mr Albanese who has announced more reviews than he has policies. As he said yesterday that he wants to hit the ground reviewing, not running the country. And we’ve got the shadow treasurer who’s out there today making it very clear that Labor’s deficits will be higher and you won’t find out what’s in a Labor budget until October. Now we’ve been waiting three years to hear the economic plan of Mr Albanese. Three years. Nothing. Zilch. Zero. Absolutely nothing. And now he’s saying you have to wait ‘till October. You know, you don’t get to run for prime minister on the basis of just saying, it’s your turn. You have to actually have stumped up and presented the Australian people with an outline of what your economic plan is. Even an outline would do, but he hasn’t even managed that. So this election really is a choice ... Labor doesn’t know what they’re going to do, and as a result they don’t deserve your vote, because they account to just too much risk at a time like this. Not saying is becoming a theme this election: Scott Morrison is back in Gilmore. The Liberals want to take it from Labor and hope former state minister Andrew Constance will help them do it. It’s a fair bet that real estate agents would have advised sellers to avoid 21 May for planned auctions for obvious election distraction reasons. As things stand, though, the property market has already lost its sizzle, at least in Sydney and Melbourne. Brigid Delaney colourfully described the shifting mood over this past weekend – the first test since the RBA lifted its cash rate last Tuesday. CoreLogic has firmed up the clearance details further this morning, and it’s not looking promising if you were aiming to sell at the top of the market: In the past week, just over 2,000 homes went to auction across the capital cities, with Melbourne and Sydney making up about three-quarters of the total, CoreLogic said. That tally was down a quarter from the previous week, and a third lower than this time a year ago. Of the 1,611 results collected so far, 64.7% were successful, once again overtaking the previous week as the lowest preliminary clearance rate recorded so far this year,” the data group says. A week earlier, the revised figure came in at 62.9%, so the preliminary clearance rate could drop below 60%, which would be the first time since August 2021 during the depths of the east coast Covid lockdowns. Sydney, the most expensive major city in Australia (and right up there, globally), the conditions were worse than the average. This past week’s auctions were off 43% from a year ago, and down about a third on the previous week. The harbour city’s preliminary clearance rate of 58.7%will drop a few percentage points or more. Excluding a pre-Australia Day week in January (more sausages), this past week looks like being Sydney’s worst clearance rate since April 2020. If confidence is beginning to evaporate already after one RBA rate rise, you have to wonder at what it will look like if investors are even partly on the money: UNSW researchers like Hal Pawson and Chris Martin have made the point about how much we’ve managed to hitch our economy’s fortunes to the property market. Looks like a rough ride might be ahead ... Vivian Lobo was referred to the AFP by the AEC on the weekend, after questions were raised over his residential address. Anthony Albanese will hold a press conference with SA Labor premier Peter Malinauskas in the early afternoon, with a health announcement. We have had a few queries on what is happening on WeChat this election. Wing Kuang and Anne Davies take a look: Don’t be surprised if we don’t have a result on election night. Peter Hannam will have more on this very soon: Labor’s spokesperson on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has stopped short of committing to a specific timeframe for increasing foreign aid to at least 0.5% of gross national income. At a forum at the Australian National University, Conroy was asked about the following statement in the 2021 Labor platform: Labor will, over time, achieve a funding target for the international development program of at least 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income. Labor will increase aid as a percentage of Gross National Income every year that we are in office starting with our first budget. Asked whether that might be achievable in a first term of a Labor government, Conroy says: Repairing Australia’s ODA budget is going to take a long time and concerted resources … I’m not going to give you that guarantee of reaching it in a first term. Development policy observers have noted that the Australian government’s own figures for the 2022-23 financial year suggest ODA as a share of GNI is expected to fall to 0.2%. Conroy says Labor has made a “down payment” by announcing $525m extra for ODA for the Pacific and Timor-Leste over four years, and that people should expect further announcements soon regarding Labor priorities for south-east Asia, the rest of world and multilateral institutions. He suggests there will be a broader ODA figure released “before the election”. Conroy says improving support for the Pacific was important before the Solomon Islands deal: We have not just woken up to it now. Conroy says he can’t emphasise enough “how shortsighted it was to halve assistance to Indonesia”. He says Labor takes international development seriously and regards it as a critical arm of the broader foreign affairs and security strategies. Labor has vowed that its promise of $525m extra in aid for the Pacific and Timor-Leste won’t be funded by cuts to the rest of the Official Development Assistant (ODA) budget. The opposition’s spokesperson on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has been addressing a forum at the Australian National University. Conroy argued the government’s Pacific Step Up “was funded by a step down everywhere else in the world”. He said Labor’s previously announced $525m in extra ODA for the region over four years would be in addition to the existing overall ODA budget. Conroy has been stepping through elements of Labor’s Pacific policy, which includes a pledge to take the region’s concerns about the climate crisis seriously. He notes Scott Morrison and others in the government call Pacific Islands countries family: Who needs family if they blatantly disregard an issue you see as your greatest threat. Conroy says Morrison says the Coalition is committed to net zero by 2050 “but his coalition is hopelessly divided on it” with Barnaby Joyce implying the target is non-binding. More broadly, Conroy announces a Labor government would increase funding for the Australian NGO Cooperation Programme – in which NGOs run community-based projects – by $32m over four years. Pauline Hanson’s Please Explain cartoon series has been taken down from YouTube after the Australian reported the AEC had written to Hanson warning of legal action if the videos were not removed or updated with the required authorisations by 8am today. Thank you to the blog watcher who sent in this photo to me – seems like quite a few people are keen to get it all over and done with Sarah Hanson-Young thinks last night’s debate was so bad, debates now need legislation. From her statement: The Australian Greens will move in the next parliament to establish an Independent Debates Commission to oversee live television election debates, with last night’s leaders’ debate once again proving to be a farce. Greens spokesperson for media and communications Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: “Last night’s debate was woeful and a disservice to voters. “Those of us who suffered through it watched two grown men – so-called leaders – shouting at each other, interrupting, smirking and aggressively talking over the top of others including the female moderator. “Australians shouldn’t be subjected to this unseemly squabble again. An election debate should be a contest of ideas and vision for our country, not chest-thumping. “We need an Independent Debates Commission that oversees the official election debate. I will move for this in the new parliament. There was a lot in that debate which needs fact checking, but Scott Morrison’s reverse ferret on his “it’s not a race” statement in relation to vaccine procurement stands out. It was a race Anthony and we shouldn’t have described it in those terms. Because for months after, Morrison rejected he was ever talking about vaccine procurement: When we made those remarks, we were talking about the regulation of the vaccines. I’m not sure if people are aware of that.” [July 2021] So not only did he say “we” (he) was wrong, it also throws into the spotlight how he tried to spin the comment in the months following. More than 500 prepolling booths have opened across the country. The Women’s Legal Service in Queensland has released it’s wish list for the election, saying: Women’s services, especially those who work in the domestic, family and sexual violence space, have been appalled by the little attention that women, their safety, financial independence, stability and equity has received this election. The wish list: 1. Immediate action on building more social housing and increases to Centrelink entitlements so women can afford to rent and move into longer-term housing. 2. Urgently redraft the Family Law Act, especially the existing presumption of “equal shared parental responsibility”. 3. Increase access to justice by reducing the amount of pre-action forms required to be completed and fund the pre-action procedure process for vulnerable people. 4. Develop a new pathway for permanent residency to support women experiencing domestic violence on temporary visas, including women who have children who are Australian citizens. 5. Leadership. Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff has tested positive for Covid-19 and will isolate for a week. Rockliff said he woke on Monday morning with mild virus symptoms and took a rapid antigen test. “I have tested positive for Covid-19 and will now follow public health advice and isolate for the next seven days,” he said in a statement. “Due to being fully vaccinated, including my booster, I am feeling well and will recover while working from home.” Rockliff attended the Tasmania JackJumpers’ NBL grand final series game against the Sydney Kings in Hobart on Sunday afternoon. He became the island state’s 47th premier in early April in a Liberal party room vote, after Peter Gutwein quit politics following two years in the top job. Health authorities, meanwhile, have said being vaccinated against flu this winter is especially important with coronavirus still circulating in the community. NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant last week said getting a flu shot was just as important as being vaccinated for Covid-19 as flu cases spike with international borders reopening after two years. Cases of flu in NSW have more than doubled in recent weeks to 1024. Q: Dominic Perrottet says a minority government is good for democracy. Do you agree? Anthony Albanese: I want a majority Labor government. That is my position and I will be working every day for 76 ... I think we should have 150 Labor members in the House of Representatives. That is my starting point. I think we will fall short of that. But my objective is 76. Thanks, very much, see you in Adelaide. And the press conference ends. Q: The debate got fiery last night by both you and Scott Morrison. You mentioned disillusioned voters last night, what are they meant to make of two leaders shouting at each other? Anthony Albanese: Scott Morrison didn’t have anything to say except shouting. He only had smears and that smirk throughout it all. Last night I put forward ideas about cheaper childcare. Our ideas about cheaper energy bills and dealing with climate change, our ideas about making more things here, our ideas about lifting living standards through practical measures to lift wages. Our plans for more affordable housing, for addressing those issues, whether it be social housing or our help to buy program. They are the positive policies we put forward. I ask to you think about what were the policy measures that Scott Morrison said he would do in his fourth term if he’s elected? If he is given three more years, we can’t afford three more years of the same, three more years of smears and scares. That is all this government has got. In their drops to newspapers, breathtakingly reported like Labor has an off-budget program to build social housing, using the interest from the housing Australia Future Fund, then if that is all they’ve got, they are out of time and ideas. Q: You have gone to this election promising to increase wages, given the fact that inflation is going to be double what wages growth is, isn’t that a massive hole in your central platform that you won’t be able to deliver on something you’re promising now? Anthony Albanese: Not at all. There are two approaches towards wages at this election. Scott Morrison and his government, who want low wage growth to be a key feature of their economic architecture, they have said that. Explicitly they have said that, the former finance minister and Labor which understands that we don’t want people to be left behind, we don’t want peoples’ living standards to be falling and that is our approach. That is why we support wage increases for aged care workers. That is why we want to change the definition of the way that areas like the gender issues operate, so there has only been one successful case in the 21 that have been taken over recent years, going way back and in 2012 – you asked the question and now you get the answer. That is the way it works. In 2012, we successfully, as the Labor government, put forward a submission for the social and community services award. What that did was lead to an increase in pay that kept communities sector workers working in that sector. That led to higher wages, particularly for women in that sector. That is what we did. We will continue to make practical measures that make a difference, including same job, same pay and just one difference as well that I can’t understand this government. Government had legislation before the parliament to outlaw wage theft and make it a crime and they withdrew it. They withdrew it even though it had overwhelming support. It says it all about this government. At the same time, they had legislation which wanted to get rid of the better off overall test. You only want to get rid of the better off overall test if you don’t want people to be better off overall. Q: On last night you [said] negative gearing being a good thing. That is the exact opposite of your party’s policy from the last election. Did you not support that policy and just not speak up at all? Doesn’t negative gearing contribute to an overheated housing market? Anthony Albanese: We weren’t successful at the last election. We have come up with a better housing policy that we are taking to this election. Q: On your economic plan, Labor’s budget spending plans are going to see the nation’s debt balloon by another $52bn to pay for your climate change and affordable housing programs. With deficits set to increase by $10bn under your government, doesn’t this threaten your attacks on the Coalition over economic management and will you commit to budget repair? Anthony Albanese: They are getting desperate, aren’t they? Here we have spending that is on the same basis as the National Broadband Network, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that they tried to abolish. This is an investment that produces a return. You only have off budget commitments if it produces a return to the government. For example, our housing Australia Future Fund will see $10bn invested through the Future Fund, by the way, which was established and Peter Costello and others were appointed to and the interest on that, the interest on that to be used to invest in social housing. This is good policy. It makes sense and it will make a difference. Q: You had a meeting with the Archbishop this morning. What did you discuss with him and are you concerned about religious voters going away from the Labor party? Anthony Albanese: Not at all. I know his Grace very well. You won’t be surprised by that, given I am an ex student of this school. We meet regularly and when I meet with a Catholic Archbishop or my local priest, it is not the subject of public information, it was a private chat, wasn’t terribly political. It is on a personal level, I regard Anthony Fisher as someone who is a friend, he is Archbishop, and we discussed a range of personal issues and it included Catholic education and how important it is. Q: On wages, you said last night you will try to lift real wages but you couldn’t guarantee it. Why won’t you make that guarantee and is that the ambitious message you want to take to voters? Anthony Albanese: I am very confident that working with business and unions – you will recall – I think you were at the speech I gave at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week, a serious speech of half an hour to 150 business leaders. The Reserve Bank over a long period of time has warned that one of the weaknesses in the economy was the falling real wages. They referred to that consistently over a number of years. The truth is we have had flatlining wages over 10 years. The key to lifting wages is lifting productivity. One of the things I will do, first things I will do is to convene a full employment summit. We will have a full employment white paper. We will work with business and unions to enterprise bargaining but we will change the Act so secure work is an objective of the Act. We will make gender pay equity an objective as well. We have a range of policies aimed towards that. The other thing we need to do is to recognise that so many people are doing it just so tough. Half a million Australians are working three or more jobs. People in the aged care sector are earning as little as $22 an hour. The minimum wage is $20.33. If you are working $22 an hour in what is a tough job – it is tough physically but it is incredibly tough emotionally and on people’s mental health which is why people are leaving the sector. We need to address that. Our clear objective is to lift up living standards. That is our objective. That is what we will work on. It stands in stark contrast. The prime minister last night – I got two questions to the prime minister, one of them I thought was pretty easy, which is should people be paid the minimum wage? You know what he said? “It depends.” He couldn’t even say that Australian workers should be paid the minimum wage. Q: During the religious discrimination debate you said a Labor government would act to protect all students, gay and transgender. How soon will this occur if Labor wins government? Tanya Plibersek: Labor has been very clear that we support action to protect people of faith from discrimination on the basis of religion. We have been consistently clear that we don’t want to see any child discriminated against, any legislation will be done in the normal way. If we form government we will consult widely on the legislation. We don’t want to do what Scott Morrison has done which is divide the nation by introducing this type of legislation. Anthony Albanese tells the press pack they are going to three states today and there will be a number of opportunities to ask him questions. Anthony Albanese and Tanya Plibersek are at Albanese’s old high school to talk teachers and getting high-achieving students into teaching degrees – and career changes: Last night I outlined positive plans for Australia’s future. Scott Morrison was left with just smears, scares and a smirk. That is all he has got after three terms of government, asking for another three years. We can’t afford to waste another three years. We can’t afford three more years of the same, with a government that won’t acknowledge the problems that are there, let alone provide solutions for it. This government thinks that people have got it easy. The truth is that they haven’t. We are facing real challenges and one of the challenges is how we become a smarter country, how we deal with education and training and that is what today’s announcement is about. Victoria has posted its covid update for the last 24 hours Three lives were lost in NSW Bridget McKenzie also refers to the “teal” independents (of which the Nationals are facing their own threat in Nicholls) as “groupies”. Asked why she calls them that, McKenzie says: “Well, they don’t want to be called a political party. I am very, very happy to call them Simon Holmes à Court’s political party if you like.” In case it needs to be said, receiving support or funding from the same group doesn’t make you a political party – there are multiple businesses and billionaires which donate to the different political parties at the same time in Australia. In her interview with ABC radio RN this morning, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie had the lines and she delivered them. We saw last week, Albanese can’t even handle the campaign press pack, it begs the question how is he going to handle Xi Jinping or Putin?” Which is a ridiculous line by any measure. When asked how much of a drag Scott Morrison was on the Coalition vote, McKenzie said: Well, you don’t have to like him, but you have to recognise who is actually up to the job of being prime minister of a country of about $2 trillion in incredibly difficult times. But she was also put under pressure by the “Barnaby line” – a phrase coined by Gabrielle Chan. I think, those people who bother to get out of capital cities and have a look around, realise that we are a very diverse party, we are very diverse. Gabby lives in regional Australia, on a farm. Liberal MP Dave Sharma has played down the significance of directing his voters to preference the United Australia party candidate in second position in his ultra-marginal electorate of Wentworth, insisting he hasn’t endorsed the party’s policies. Appearing at a candidates’ debate hosted by the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies on Sunday night, Sharma was asked about his how-to-vote material which urges voters to preference UAP candidate Natalie Dumer second, given the party had “platformed neo-Nazi” voices in the past. Sharma responded by saying “preferencing someone does not amount to an endorsement of their policies” and that “it’s just something you need to put on the ballot paper”. He said that given the “historical pattern” of voting in Wentworth, the Liberal candidate finished first so preferences made little difference. Sharma added: “I would say to each of you who are Wentworth residents, number the boxes however you’d like.” Sharma’s comments that preferences aren’t an endorsement of a party’s policies follows his criticism of Allegra Spender, the teal independent challenging him in Wentworth, for not including any preference directions to voters on her voting pamphlets. “She will not say who she will support in a hung parliament, all but guaranteeing the chaos of minority government. She even refuses to disclose her preferences so as not to show her hand,” Sharma told SBS news last week. The Liberal party holds Wentworth on a slim margin of 1.3%, and at Sunday’s debate both Sharma and Spender were appealing to the 12.5% of the electorate who are Jewish. Anthony Albanese will be holding his press conference at his old high school this morning as part of Labor’s teacher scholarship announcement. That’s expected to be held fairly early this morning. The religious discrimination bill became an issue over the weekend, with Scott Morrison saying he remained committed to passing it through the parliament, while also claiming gay students were not being expelled from religious schools. Paul Karp covers that off here: Jason Clare spoke on that too: We support the introduction of legislation to deal with religious discrimination. I got to tell you – as somebody who represents a really multicultural part of Australia in the western suburbs of Sydney, you know, I know that people get discriminated against based on their faith, whether it’s the cross they wear around their neck or whether it’s the hijab that they wear in the streets, you know, I see and hear stories of people being discriminated against. So we should be taking action there. But we should be good enough and capable enough to be able to do this in a way that deals with all sorts of discrimination and doesn’t discriminate others more by trying to solve one problem. You know, we should be able to do all of that and I fear that what the prime minister is doing here is trying to tackle one issue, not another. One of the consequences of that, though, is he’s got a divided party. He’s got his own members here they’ll they cross the floor again. But he also said there was no reason protections for LGBTIQ students can’t be done at the same time: You know, remember – we have some of the highest rates of teenage suicide in the world. Some of the most vulnerable kids here that are affected by this debate are relying upon us to act with maturity, to act with a bit of wisdom here and I think it’s not beyond us as a parliament to do it. Jason Clare says Labor’s policy will have ongoing wider impacts: There aren’t many jobs, aren’t many professions more important than a teacher. I think we can all think of a teacher that shaped our life, changed our life. A quick shoutout to Peter, Peter Valenti if you’re watching today, mate, I still keep in touch with Peter today. We still catch up a couple of times a year. Teachers can change your lives. We got two challenges at the moment. One, we got a general teach shortage. It’s expect that there’ll be a shortage of around 4,000 teachers within the next couple of years. And we’re not getting enough people who get the top marks in the HSC in their Atars going into teaching. If you go back 30 years, then 30% of the people who got top marks went into teaching. It’s now only about 3% and that’s in stark contrast to places like Finland as well as Singapore. These financial payments are about encouraging more people to become teachers, because the evidence from the UK, the work the Grattan Institute has done, is if you can get our best and brightest to become teachers, then it flows on, it helps our young people, our children, to get better results and set them up for the future as well. Labor’s policy announcement today is on education, as Paul Karp reports: High-achieving students who want to become teachers will be given at least $10,000 a year to study education under a Labor plan to improve teacher quality. Under the policy, to be announced on Monday, 5,000 students with an Atar of 80 or more will receive the scholarship to study an education degree, with an extra $2,000 bonus a year for those who teach in a regional area. Labor will aim to double the number of high achievers studying to become teachers over the next decade, from about 1,800 to 3,600 a year. The package will cost $146.5m over four years, and includes an extra 1,500 places in high achieving teachers’ programs. On the opinion polls, Jason Clare says: My advice to you, and I know you don’t need it because you know this – is ignore the polls. Treat them with suspicion, they were wrong last time. I suspect they’ll be wrong this time as well. I do think Australians are fed up ... with Scott Morrison and his government. I think they’re sick of the lies and rorts and incompetence. The fact is Scott Morrison can’t visit a whole bunch of Liberal party electorates at the moment because he’s political kryptonite. If he turns up in some of these teal seats, some of his members will keel over and go in the foetal position. He’s got a problem that most Australians have worked him out and don’t want him as prime minister of Australia. But the next two weeks are a big opportunity for us to tell the story about how we can build a better future for all, the whole bunch, of different policies to tackle the sort of problems that Aussies care about. Jason Clare is continuing his role as the Labor party’s campaign spokesperson, where he has adopted an “everyman” persona to explain things. Here he is on the ABC talking about the debate: One of the things that struck me, was it had all the hallmarks of that first US presidential debate that we saw a couple of years ago with Donald Trump just yelling and being rude. You saw that from Scott Morrison last night. I think that turns people off. All that try-hard bully-boy stuff, might work in the Liberal party, but didn’t work last night. Yes, but Anthony Albanese yelled as well, Clare is told, to which he says: You’ve got to push back. When someone’s trying to bully you or overpower you, you stand up to them. That’s what those did last night. You come back with the facts, you come back with the truth. That’s Scott Morrison’s problem here – you had two leaders going head to head here, one of them had a plan to fix some of the problems that we have in this country, the other just had a pack of excuses which shouldn’t surprise us. That’s been – that’s been Scott Morrison’s stocking trade for the last three year. There is a world where Bob Katter could be one of the MPs holding the balance of power in the lower house. Hopefully not this one, but if the multiverse theory is true, then that universe exists. Today he is worried about Australians being a “vanishing race”. The Katter’s Australian party (KAP) MP says Australians are a vanishing race of people, and we must pull policy levers to encourage people to have families. Double income no kids (DINKS) couples are paying tax at the same rate as families with a stay-at-home wife or husband and three kids. How can anyone consider this to be fair. Income tax splitting should be legalised for families with a single income and children, and prorated down for less deserving situations. The income earner should be able to split their income with the number of people dependant on that income (whether that be their spouse and the number of children they have under 18). ...This policy will encourage people to have children. It is an imperative because otherwise we will vanish as a race of people. I’m saying have one for Mum, one for Dad, one for Australia and one for Bob. Unions are seeking a $2,200 per year rise in the minimum wage, upping their demands as surging inflation reduces workers’ pay in real terms. The Australian Council of Trade Unions had originally asked for a 5% rise but will now ask the Fair Work Commission for 5.5%, less of an ambit claim now inflation is tipped to hit 5.5% by mid year and 6% by year’s end. As runaway inflation has already triggered a mid-election campaign interest rate rise, cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation have emerged as the most important issues for voters ahead of the 21 May election. Unions have responded by increasing pay demands in the understaffed aged care sector and in state public services, subject to a 2.5% pay rise cap that amounts to a real wage cut. In the minimum wage case, which sets the pay of 2.7m workers, the ACTU is now asking for the hourly rate to rise from $20.33 to $21.45. The ACTU’s earlier claim was lodged in late March, after the Morrison government’s budget predicted inflation would peak at 4.25% mid-year. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said “a 5.5% increase is what is now needed just to ensure people tread water, anything less has them drowning in bills”. “Scott Morrison’s government’s submission to the Fair Work Commission is silent on backing a pay increase that keeps up with the cost of living. “Instead it dedicates a whole section to the benefits of low-paid work.” In the earlier round of submissions, the Australian Industry Group called for a 2% increase, or $15.45 a week to the minimum wage. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association called for no increase in the minimum wage, arguing take-home pay is already rising due to job shortages, on top of super increases and budget giveaways. OK Both leaders ended Sunday in Sydney, so they could take part in the debate. They’ll be off pretty early this morning – we’ll let you know where as soon as it’s confirmed There are 12 days to go until election day. Twelve days of campaigning, commentary and complaints. Polls open today though, so if you’ve made up your mind, you can vote and tune out for the rest of the campaign. It’s the morning after the leaders’ debate the night before and anyone who was unlucky enough to watch it is probably still wondering what happened. There was shouting. There was 60 seconds to answer each question. There was more shouting. Scott Morrison said he’d never seen corruption. Morrison was declared the winner, then Albanese was declared the winner, then it was a tie. But really, anyone who didn’t watch it was the real winner. There’s one more to go on Wednesday. The debate happened just as the AFR published an Ipos poll showing Labor remained in an election-winning lead and the Australian published a Newspoll showing the same thing. There is still just under two weeks though and don’t be surprised if individual electorates throw up some wildcards. As has been said many times before and by people much smarter than me, this is an election without a national mood. The last couple of years impacted people differently, depending on which state they lived in. That fracturing will play a role. So it’s going to be slugged out seat by seat. And that’s before you even get to the impact of independents and minor parties. We’ll be sure to cover it all for you, with Katharine Murphy (still recovering from whatever it was she watched late last night) Paul Karp, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst and Josh Butler all here to help you make sense of it. You have Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day. Ready? Sames.

Repatriating 150,000 holidaymakers could mean a bill of £100m. Hoteliers have to be compensated, probably to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. And the biggest cost involves refunding customers for future bookings. The whole bundle could run to £500m. The travel industry has an insurance scheme, but taxpayers could still be on the hook for a shortfall. Consideration must also be given to the pain caused to employees and customers. On social media, you can find desperate former Thomas Cook airline crew and branch staff appealing for new employment opportunities. Operation Matterhorn, the Civil Aviation Authority’s repatriation effort, has been slick but holidaymakers have nonetheless suffered stress and disruption. Should the government have saved Thomas Cook instead? No. That argument was aired immediately after the company’s collapse but its credibility has weakened by the day. Thomas Cook was in an ugly financial state. Even a £200m contribution from public coffers to a wider creditor-led £1.1bn restructuring plan might not have been enough. The high court witness statement from the company’s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, described a balance sheet deficit of £3.1bn. Frankly, Wrightbus, the Ballymena-based Routemaster bus company that was last week’s other major corporate collapse, had a better claim for public rescue – and it wasn’t saved. Postmortems on Thomas Cook’s collapse, however, are essential. The Insolvency Service and the Financial Reporting Council will do their work but the inquiry by the business select committee, chaired by the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, will be the first step. Reeves should not be too obsessed with her idea that the downfall of Thomas Cook “appears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed”. Yes, £35m in pay over 12 years for the past three chief executives looks appalling, but treat the numbers with care. Of Fankhauser’s notional £8.4m haul, about £4m seems to have been in the form of shares he held until they became worthless. Incompetence and hubris in the boardroom look to be the direct causes. Fankhauser, in post for four years, and Frank Meysman, chairman since 2011, must explain why they didn’t fix a fragile balance sheet when it seemed possible. The stock market valued Thomas Cook’s equity at £2bn as late as May 2018. Shareholders would not have cheered a rights issue to raise, say, £500m at that point, but the job of directors is to take the long view. Fankhauser and Meysman could have pitched a reasonable argument along these lines: repay some debt, lower the interest costs and allow more investment in new, company-owned hotels, the focus of the turnaround strategy. In November 2017 in the annual report, Meysman wrote that “a highly competitive environment ... has contributed to the collapse of a number of competitors in the last 12 months”, so he was clearly aware of the external risks. Given that Thomas Cook itself almost failed in 2011, reducing debt should have been the absolute priority. The most astonishing statistic in the whole saga is that the company paid £1.2bn in interest charges after 2010. As for the accounting angle, Reeves’s committee must ask why Thomas Cook recorded so many one-off charges and “separately disclosed items” over the years. The company was in restructuring mode, so heavy use of exceptional items is not unusual, but EY, after it took over from PwC as auditor in 2017, challenged some of the treatments. Why hadn’t the company’s own audit committee done so previously? There must also be an explanation of why a £1.1bn goodwill writedown on the purchase of MyTravel appeared in the interim results only this year – the acquisition itself happened in 2007. Fankhauser and Meysman, no doubt, will issue grovelling apologies to the committee. That’s the usual form for directors who have failed. It’s an explanation for their actions, though, that former employees deserve to hear. If recession is looming, governments must start spending now The economic optimists reject the suggestion from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that everyone should prepare for a global recession, arguing that these institutions missed the last financial crash and are desperate to avoid a repeat of their mistake, even if it means forecasting the next one many years before it actually happens. In her first public statement after being confirmed as the new head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva said last week that the global economy needed to be ready to cope with a fresh economic downturn. The week before, the OECD’s chief economist, Laurence Boone, was notably downbeat, citing the chilling effect of Donald Trump’s trade war with China and the uncertainty created by Brexit as reasons to be gloomy. The main message from both organisations was directed at governments, which they believe must be prepared to step up their spending now that the private sector has seen the warning signs of recession and stopped investing. The last time the global economy dealt with a shock, governments played a part in the rescue. That was in the days when leaders such as Gordon Brown could command the attention of his peers in arguing for a comprehensive and costly lifeboat. Then, after the 2008 crash, the job of rebuilding crisis-hit economies was left to central banks. Hence the era of ultra-low interest rates. The justified fear is that the next crisis will be characterised by governments pleading poverty to justify inaction. Either they will argue they are bereft of the necessary funds or that borrowing is already too high. Georgieva knows central banks have little firepower left after a decade of providing cheap money, which is why she is right to call on governments to open their wallets now, and not wait until it’s too late. EDF is well insulated from cost of nuclear power The UK’s first new nuclear plant in a generation was once expected to cost £12bn. Today, Hinkley Point in Somerset is expected to cost almost double that, and there is no guarantee costs won’t continue to climb. The latest estimate revealed last week by French energy group EDF piled an extra £2.9bn on to the cost of the project, which could reach £22.5bn by the time it begins powering British homes in 2025. EDF delivered the news with a shrug. After all, it is not the first time the French nuclear giant has admitted that work on the Somerset site will cost more and take longer than it first hoped. And it won’t “add a penny” to home energy bills, it said. But the cost increase raises difficult questions over the government’s plan to support another of EDF’s nuclear projects, at Sizewell in Suffolk, by putting the taxpayer on the hook for cost overruns. The government argues that a funding model which shares the financial risk between EDF and British energy consumers would lower the overall energy cost. But given EDF’s track record on cost overruns, many wonder whether the risks are worth taking at all. More worryingly, there are new questions over whether British homes are already paying too much to cushion EDF against the risks at Hinkley. A £2.9bn overspend is no small beer, but EDF will take it on the chin because, despite the multibillion-pound overrun, Hinkley is still a profitable venture. The company expects its rate of return for the project to fall from more than 9% when the deal was first struck to a still-respectable 7.7%. Which raises the question: if the Hinkley nuclear deal was generous enough to cushion EDF against its own cost overruns, was it a good deal for bill payers? And should ministers be striking another?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2020/jan/19/id-like-to-vote-democratic-the-swing-voters-who-want-a-reason-not-to-back-trump-again","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-19T10:00:54Z","webTitle":"'I'd like to vote Democratic': the swing voters who want a reason not to back Trump again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/id-like-to-vote-democratic-the-swing-voters-who-want-a-reason-not-to-back-trump-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/id-like-to-vote-democratic-the-swing-voters-who-want-a-reason-not-to-back-trump-again","fields":{"headline":"'I'd like to vote Democratic': the swing voters who want a reason not to back Trump again","bodyText":"It’s not that James Padot hugely admires Donald Trump or his values. After all, Padot spent more than four decades as a pipe fitter, a skilled trade that provided a good living but relied on the power of his labour union for work and to ensure he was decently paid. He worked on grand projects around the midwest including construction of the nuclear power plant in his hometown of Monroe, Michigan. So Padot is a fan of organised labour and feels a pull to vote Democrat. But after twice supporting Barack Obama in presidential elections, he cast his ballot for Trump in 2016. Nearly four years later, he has yet to be presented with a reason not to do so again. “I’d like to vote Democratic. But I watched the people they have and some of what they’re talking about and some of it’s just crazy,” he said. So, as things stand, Padot will once more vote for Trump in a county that saw one of the largest swings in the country from the first African American president to a divisive leader denounced by his opponents as racist, corrupt and unfit for office. Obama twice took Monroe county, just south of Detroit. But in 2016 Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there, winning by more than 16,000 votes. Those votes alone delivered Michigan to Trump by the narrowest margin of victory – just 10,704 votes – in the history of presidential elections. The state, in turn, was an important part of the electoral college puzzle that put him in the White House. Trump’s slim victory makes Michigan an important target for the Democrats this year along with other states that flipped to the Republican four years ago. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is returning to three counties in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa that swung from Obama to Trump to ask which way they will go in November. Opinion polls suggest that any of the leading Democratic candidates would beat Trump in Michigan although, 10 months before the election, they provide inspiration more than expectation to many Democrats fearful that the wrong candidate – too centrist or too liberal – could let Trump back in. ‘He’ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good’ While Trump commands the unwavering loyalty of a hardcore of voters, his victory was secured by people like Padot whose support is much softer. But, so far at least, many of them are still willing to back the president even though they have plenty of doubts. Trump has the lowest approval ratings at this stage of the campaign of any incumbent running for re-election since the 1970s. Like so many other swing voters, Padot voted for Trump to shake up the system. As things stand, he thinks the president will win again in Monroe county and nationally. “Everybody knew he’s a huckster but they were so mad at the status quo,” he said. “He’ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good.They might say there are these other things but once the curtain closes and they have to vote, then it’s the economy. I just think that’s the way it is.” In places, the definition of the economy doing well is not an indication of prosperity but, rather, a lack of unemployment. Monroe county has jobs but the steady well-paid work relied on by thousands of people for decades disappeared with factory closures. In 2008, the local Ford car plant shut, taking with it 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. The knock-on effect of lost wages was felt by local stores and other businesses in downtown Monroe city, the county capital, dotted with ghost shops. A largely abandoned shopping mall sits on the edge of town. Monroe Democrats, still reeling from Trump’s victory, are split on how to respond. Bill LaVoy, who held the local seat in the state legislature until he was swept out by the 2016 political whirlwind, backs the former vice-president Joe Biden as a safe candidate who can appeal to Democrats who defected to Trump. ‘The Democrats think the only way they win is by appealing to those Trump voters on Trump’s terms’ On the other hand, a younger generation thinks the leadership is running scared when it focuses on trying to win back voters like Padot instead of offering a more radical alternative. “They lost to Trump and they’re just so scared it’s going to happen again,” said Christopher Slat, a 31-year-old Democratic campaign activist. “They think the only way they can do it is by trying to appeal to those Trump voters on Trump’s terms. If the Democrats don’t have a compelling policy answer to address people’s actual problems, then they’re just going to keep being resentful and keep voting for the most spiteful rightwing people.” Slat, who recently declared a run for the state legislature seat lost by LaVoy, backs Bernie Sanders because he said the senator has policies the party can sell to mobilise new voters. “I’m not overly concerned with winning Trump voters back as much as I am activating people who don’t always vote or activating the new populations of young people who are coming into the electorate,” he said. Slat sees young first-time voters as having been dragged into becoming more politically engaged by issues such as the climate crisis and school shootings. Trump is more unpopular among young people than any other age group with polls showing that through most of his presidency twice as many 18- to 29-year-olds disapprove of his leadership as approve. In important swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump won with such slim margins, young first-time voters could decide the outcome in November and the Democrats are working hard to mobilise them in major cities. But a big question remains over how many will actually turn out to vote. Still, Slat is not writing off swing voters. He thinks some can be won back by focusing on what drove them to vote for Trump in the first place, and tying their disillusionment with the system to corporate corruption of politics. He said healthcare is a path into that because the high cost of insurance and treatment can be linked the medical industry’s influence in blocking reforms that might reduce profits. “You tie it to the anti-corporate message because everybody understands the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, especially people who vote for Trump. They understand that the system is corrupt and rigged,” said Slat. ‘Sanders seems sharp but he’s too socialist – him and Warren’ Padot is among those Trump voters who would like to see reform of the health system but he doesn’t have any more confidence in the Democrats than the Republicans to do it. “What’s really stupid is that there are countries all around the world that have healthcare for everybody. One of those has to be the best. So just copy that. How hard is that? But no, this is America. We’ve gotta reinvent the wheel and it’s not gonna work,” he said. But then Padot is not impressed by any of the Democratic candidates. “I don’t think any of them are like Obama. That guy, he came out of nowhere. The guy could talk. He’s very charismatic. I don’t see that on any of these people,” he said. “Joe Biden, I think his time has gone. Bernie [Sanders] seems sharp but he’s too socialist – him and Warren. Their ideas won’t play well in Michigan or Nebraska or Iowa.” Opinion polls show all the main Democratic contenders beating Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin but losing to him in Iowa. . Across the city, at the Oaks of Righteousness Christian Ministries homeless shelter in one of the poorest districts of Monroe, Rob Burgess is equally disparaging not only about the Democratic candidates but all politicians. The former soldier who went on to work for a cable company before deciding to reorder his life by working at a homeless shelter, doesn’t vote because he doesn’t trust any politicians and doesn’t think it will make much difference to Monroe who is president. “I never voted. Never had any confidence in our political system,” he said. “I don’t want to say I would never vote but I still don’t believe in our political system.” His own take on Trump is mixed. He viewed the president’s 2016 election campaign with scepticism, thinking it was all an act “to get attention for his next best thing”. But then he got elected. Burgess sees Trump as his own man, which he likes, and said the president has followed through on some of the promises he made. But he repeats the oft-heard criticisms about Trump on Twitter, although he excuses those tweets widely denounced as racist saying they are the result of the president’s “social ignorance”. There are limits for Burgess. He regarded Trump’s threat to attack Iranian cultural sites as wrong because it is against the Geneva Conventions. Still, he has little time for the Democrats who he accuses of putting all their efforts into trying to unseat Trump. Meanwhile, he doesn’t see any of them helping Monroe forge a new path to prosperity. “I think life’s getting tougher in this community because there’s no good jobs that will pay for people to get above the poverty level. There are some jobs, but they’re minimal. We used to have a Ford factory here. It closed. My father worked there. Lots and lots of people’s fathers,” he said. “There’s not a lot of anywhere else to find jobs besides outside the county. Down to Toledo. Up towards Detroit. But inside Monroe county, there isn’t really any place where I could say unskilled labor where you can just go and work and make a decent living.” “Things are tough here. I do personally believe that a lot of people voted to not vote for the establishment, that they’re tired of it. Those that favoured Trump still favour him and those that didn’t still don’t. Based on that, I would say he will get re-elected again.” Burgess thinks people put too much hope in politicians. He says that working at the homeless shelter, and volunteering to provide free meals for low-income families, has more impact than any change of government. Is there anything a president can do? “Send money. I hate to say it but short of that I am not one that believes that our government can fix any of our social problems,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/aug/28/us-briefing-climate-protest-1mdb-trial-and-purdue-offers-to-settle","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-28T10:37:39Z","webTitle":"US briefing: climate protest, 1MDB trial and Purdue offers to settle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/28/us-briefing-climate-protest-1mdb-trial-and-purdue-offers-to-settle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/aug/28/us-briefing-climate-protest-1mdb-trial-and-purdue-offers-to-settle","fields":{"headline":"US briefing: climate protest, 1MDB trial and Purdue offers to settle","bodyText":"Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email.

Firm behind OxyContin ‘to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits’ Purdue Pharma and members of the multimillionaire Sackler family have reportedly offered to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits from US states and cities for up to $12bn, over the company’s role in the opioids crisis. The Connecticut-based company, owned by the Sacklers, produces the prescription painkiller OxyContin, which has become emblematic of the opioid epidemic that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people in the US over the last 20 years.

Malaysian ex-PM on trial in ‘world’s biggest kleptocracy scandal’ The former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak appeared in court in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday for the first day of his trial over the 1MDB affair, which was described as the “biggest kleptocracy scandal in the world” after its exposure in 2015. Najib, who was toppled last year after almost a decade in power, is accused of involvement in embezzling more than $4.5bn from the 1MDB government fund, which was subsequently spent on Manhattan real estate, Picasso paintings and other extreme extravagances.

As part of Moscow’s efforts to extend its influence abroad, Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company, has approached dozens of African countries to sell them billions of dollars’ worth of nuclear technology. But critics say the reactors in question are unsuitable – and unlikely to benefit the continent’s poorest people. Jason Burke reports.

The 86-year-old justice is a hero to women, says Moira Donegan, but will the advances she made on their behalf be undone after she’s gone? Ginsburg’s perseverance in the face of her own pain and enemies’ eager anticipation of her death is what has made her a beacon, ripe for idolization and symbolism by American women.

Should Brexit Britain yield to pressure from the US and ban Chinese hi-tech manufacturer Huawei from supplying kit to British mobile phone companies? Or should the UK keep the door open to China – and benefit not just from cheaper technology but across the economy in sectors such as nuclear power, where the world’s most populous country has shown it is willing to invest. Concerns about Huawei have been lingering for years. The company was once allowed to supply BT equipment a decade and half ago, partly because intelligence agency GCHQ has long believed it can contain any risk as long as the company’s technology is used judiciously. George Osborne was keen for Huawei to remain in the following years. The former chancellor once endorsed a company investment decision by the firm saying: “There are some western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain.” But the attitude of the US has hardened. The vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeatedly criticised China in recent months. In February, he singled out Huawei, telling the Munich security conference that “Beijing’s vast security apparatus” has “access to any data that touches their networks or equipment”. The US began lobbying intelligence partners – the Five Eyes network that includes the UK as well as Australia, Canada and New Zealand – to join in. Australia banned Huawei – and another Chinese supplier, ZTE – from 5G technology in August last year. Huawei insists it is independent and that it has worked successfully with western partners for a decade and a half. It is a private firm, started in 1987 (although the US points out its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former army officer) and is partly owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. This month, China made a complaint to the World Trade Organization about Australia’s action, saying it was “obviously discriminative”. Australia responded by saying its position could be defended under international trade law. It is a hot debate in Britain’s security and political community, at a time when the country hopes to strike post-Brexit trade deals with the US and Australia. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, warned: “Allowing Huawei into the UK’s 5G infrastructure would cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to Five Eyes cooperation.” Much will depend on the detail of where Huawei technology can be used following May’s decision in principle; whether supplying antennas, for example, can be considered part of the core network. GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre has stopped short of an outright ban, although its warning of last month of “significant technical issues in Huawei’s engineering processes” was hardly reassuring. There are wider considerations too. When May came into office in 2016 she ordered a review of China’s involvement in the building of the Hinkley Point nuclear plant, where China General Nuclear (CGN) is a junior partner to France’s EDF. But May approved the deal, and CGN wants to build more nuclear plants in the UK at a time when others have pulled out. Britain has the dilemma of having to decide how far to take advantage of expanding Chinese capital and knowhow at a point where the Brexit impasse has weakened it internationally. Ironically, May is herself so weak that the decision of the private meeting of the National Security Council leaked immediately. But the underlying argument about the UK’s long-term relationship with China in technology and elsewhere will continue long after she has left Downing Street."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-powerful-blows-by-ukrainian-army-as-russia-hints-at-scaling-back-offensive-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T04:40:07Z","webTitle":"Institute for Study of War says Russians unable to secure Kyiv attack positions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-powerful-blows-by-ukrainian-army-as-russia-hints-at-scaling-back-offensive-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-hails-powerful-blows-by-ukrainian-army-as-russia-hints-at-scaling-back-offensive-live","fields":{"headline":"Institute for Study of War says Russians unable to secure Kyiv attack positions – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is closed. You can find further live coverage of the war in Ukraine here. Russian forces on Saturday continued their unsuccessful efforts to secure positions from which to attack and seize Kyiv despite the supposed reframing of the Russian military’s priorities, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War. In its latest assessment of the conflict in Ukraine, the think tank said the “increasingly static nature of the fighting around Kyiv reflects the incapacity of Russian forces rather than any shift in Russian objectives or efforts at this time”. However it also said that Russian forces were likely to “bisect” the besieged port city of Mariupol, in the south-east, in the coming days and would likely gain control of it in the “relatively near future”. “The scale of Russian losses in the fight for Mariupol will determine whether the city’s fall will permit Russia to renew large-scale combat operations in eastern Ukraine. It is too soon to tell, but current indicators suggest that Russian losses have been and will continue to be high,” the institute added. Meanwhile the captured southern city of Kherson “appears to be resisting Russian control in ways that are driving the Russian military and national guard to concentrate forces on securing it,” it wrote. “The requirement to secure captured cities can impose a significant cost on over-stretched Russian forces and hinder their ability to conduct offensive operations.” On the tarmac of Dubai airport, half way along its main runway, a small terminal has been doing brisk business this month. Daily flights have disgorged dozens of Russians – many among the wealthiest figures in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. A short VIP welcome and limousine ride later, and the oligarchs are into a world that cares little about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine or the attempts to punish Putin, and has instead willingly embraced his enablers. Perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the oligarchs, and other cashed-up Russians are welcome in Dubai, along with their riches, which are flooding to the United Arab Emirates in unprecedented amounts – often via discreet means. The UAE has not followed western governments in using sanctions as retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. Bankers, real estate agents, car dealerships and marinas are reporting extraordinary demand for homes, sports cars and mooring space as the influx settles in to an oil-rich monarchy that has charted its own course on Putin’s Russia and is not afraid to expose glaring tensions with the US in doing so. Transactions, from elite property sales to leases, are largely being conducted using cryptocurrencies, but some have been straight transfers from Russian financial entities linked to sanctioned tycoons, a regional intelligence source told the Observer. Such moves undermine sanctions imposed by the US and EU on the Russian leaders’ allies and are a potent lure for the next rung of Russian businessmen who fear the same fate. For more on how rich Russians are escaping western sanctions in Dubai, read on below: While Russia is distracted by its invasion of Ukraine, Azerbaijan has moved its forces into the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Reuters reports. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday Azeri armed forces had entered a zone policed by Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, in a violation of an agreement, but Azerbaijan challenged these claims, the news agency reported. Russia said it had called on Azerbaijan to pull out its troops, and was “applying efforts” to move forces to their initial positions. It also said Azerbaijan had carried out four drone strikes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s defence ministry refuted Moscow’s version of events and described Russia’s statement as “one-sided”. It said that “illegal” Armenian armed units attempted an act of sabotage, but had to retreat when “immediate measures” were applied. It reiterated Azerbaijan’s commitment to the “three-way statement” - a deal it signed with Armenia and Russia in November 2020 to end the military conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region after more than a month of bloodshed. Azerbaijan emerged as the victor in that conflict, having recaptured territory it had lost in an earlier war between 1991 and 1994. But many questions remain unresolved, including the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenians who live there. Moscow deployed almost 2,000 peacekeepers to the region after the ceasefire, reaffirming its role as policeman and chief power broker in a volatile part of the former Soviet Union where Turkey also wields increasing influence thanks to its close alliance with Azerbaijan. Russia did not complete any of its “set tasks” on Saturday but had “partially succeeded” in some areas while forces in many places across the country were occupied with regrouping, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has said its latest update. It said “certain units of the 35th Combined Arms Red Banner Army of the Far East Military District of the Russian Ground Forces, which suffered significant losses” were being regrouped and that several units had been assigned to the Chernobyl area with the aim of restoring combat capability. “It is possible that after the implementation of these measures, regrouping and strengthening of the occupying forces, the occupiers will resume actions to block Kyiv from the south-western direction,” it noted. “Enemy units” were stopped in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, it reported and added that in two other villages east of Kyiv, Lukyanivka and Rudnytske, Russian forces had suffered “significant losses” and withdrawn to the settlements of Pisky and Nova Basan. In the heavily bombarded city of Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, Russian efforts were mainly aimed “replenishing current losses, restoring equipment and striking on the city’s civilian infrastructure.” Video posted by the Guardian’s Shaun Walker shows the devastation wrought by the Russian campaign against the town of Mariupol: There have been a number of reports that Ukrainian forces have retaken several towns across the country. The Kyiv Independent newspaper reported that two small towns, Poltavka and Malynivka, in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia had been liberated while earlier it reported that the town of Trostyanets in the northern region of Sumy had been regained. CNN also reports that it has geolocated and verified several videos showing Ukrainian troops back in control of a number of villages in Sumy as well as Vilkhivka, a settlement roughly 32 kilometres from the Russian border in Ukraine’s northeast. Some images from around Ukraine on Saturday: Here’s a bit more from Ukrainian president Zelenskiy’s speech earlier, in which he warned Russia its invasion was only working to “derussify” Ukraine, where Russian is widely spoken. By the way, we talked today with our military in Mariupol, with our heroes who defend this city, in Russian,” said the president, himself a native Russian speaker. “Because there is no language problem in Ukraine and there never was. But now you, the Russian occupiers, are creating this problem. You are doing everything to make our people stop speaking Russian themselves. Because the Russian language will be associated with you. Only with you. With these explosions and killings. With your crimes. You are deporting our people. You are bullying our teachers, forcing them to repeat everything after your propagandists. You are taking our mayors and Ukrainian activists hostage. You are placing billboards in the occupied territories with appeals (they appeared today) not to be afraid to speak Russian. Just think about what it means. Where Russian has always been a part of everyday life, like Ukrainian, in the east of our state, and where you are turning peaceful cities into ruins today. Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place on the territory of our state. You are doing it. In one generation. And forever. This is another manifestation of your suicide policy.” The International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed concern for workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, after Russian forces on Saturday seized the town of Slavutych, where many people who work at the reactor live. In a statement, the agency said director general Rafael Mariano Grossi, Remained concerned about the ability of staff at the Chornobyl NPP to regularly rotate and return to their homes in the nearby city of Slavutych to rest. There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now, the [Ukrainian] regulator said ... The regulator said the last staff rotation was on 20-21 March, when a new shift of technical personnel arrived from Slavutych to replace colleagues who had worked at the Chornobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located. There was ‘no information when or whether’ a new change of work shift would take place, it said. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, where a nuclear research facility has reportedly been damaged once again, the IAEA cited the Ukrainian regulator as saying “shelling was for a second day preventing measures to dispose of an unexploded [nearby] rocket”. “Its nuclear material is subcritical and the radioactive inventory is low,” the IAEA continued. “Personnel at the facility were maintaining the operability of the nuclear installation’s equipment and radiation was within ‘standard limits’. However, it was not possible to restore off-site power to the facility due to the shelling, the regulator added.” After the White House backpedalled on comments by president Joe Biden that appeared to call for regime change in Russia, prominent Putin critic and chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov has called the US administration “pathetic”. When a regime is repressive, murderous, dictatorial, and led by someone who has committed war crimes in multiple countries, including his own, what else should be hoped for and worked toward than regime change?” he wrote in the first of a series of tweets. “When the President is right, the White House should stick with him instead of fumbling to apologize to a murderous dictator for speaking the truth. It’s pathetic,” he continued. “Biden isn’t Trump, requiring an English to English translator! No dictator is legitimate. Don’t backpedal when you are right and in the right. Don’t play diplomatic games with a mass murderer.” In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine’s firepower in the skies - rejected earlier this month by the Pentagon as too not “tenable” - Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says the US no longer objects, according to AFP. “As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side,” Kuleba said in written comments to the newswire after a meeting with US president Joe Biden in Warsaw. Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met both Kuleba and Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov in an emphatic show of support for Kyiv. Both ministers had made a rare trip out of Ukraine for the face-to-face talks, in a possible sign of growing confidence in their battle against Russian forces. In the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence update, it says Russia has continued strikes across Ukraine, including on “many targets in densely populated civilian areas”. It also said Russia continued to rely on so-called stand-off munitions – missiles launched from a distance – “in order to reduce their aircrafts’ exposure to Ukrainian air defence forces.” “US reporting of up to 60% failure rates of these weapons will compound Russia’s problem of increasingly limited stocks forcing them to revert to less sophisticated missiles or accepting more risk to their aircraft,” it continued. In his nightly address to the Ukrainian people and the world, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the US and Europe to supply more planes, tanks, anti-missiles defences and anti-ship weaponry, arguing that Europe’s own security was at stake. “This [the weaponry] is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities. After all, this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine - this is for freedom in Europe,” he said. “So who runs the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow because of intimidation?” he added. Referring to those who are defending the besieged port city of Mariupol, he continued: I wish at least a percentage of their courage to those who have been thinking for 31 days how to transfer a dozen or two of planes or tanks ... Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns, which are too much in supplies. And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know that. All defenders of Mariupol know that. Thousands of people know that - citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade. The United States knows that. All European politicians know. We told everyone. And this should be known as soon as possible by as many people on Earth as possible. So that everyone understands who and why was simply afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision.” Hello, I’m Helen Livingstone, taking over the blog from my colleague Vivian Ho. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening over the past 24 hours: US president Joe Biden condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland. Biden appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin, although US officials later said he had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. As he spoke, Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, just 40 miles from the Polish border. The timing of the attacks, only the third on west Ukrainian targets since the war began, and the closest to Lviv’s city centre and its residential areas, was clearly designed to send a message to the White House. The Kremlin has again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could use them to strike an enemy that only used conventional weapons. The comments prompted Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appearing by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. “Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” he said. Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are deploying white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports cannot be confirmed, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Nato leaders earlier this week that Russia had used phosphorus bombs that had killed adults and children. Russian forces seized Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site on Saturday and took its mayor, Yuri Fomichev, prisoner. However, after failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. The Institute of Mass Media in Ukraine has documented 148 crimes against journalists and the media since the start of the Russian invasion. It said five journalists had been killed, six had been captured or kidnapped and seven had been wounded. The Ukrainian parliament has confirmed a fresh Russian attack on the nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv. In a tweet, it quoted the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate as saying, “It is currently impossible to estimate the extent of damage due to hostilities that do not stop in the area of the nuclear installation.” Tens of thousands of people gathered in central London to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine. After a rallying call by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for people everywhere to protest against the bloodshed by taking to the streets, Trafalgar Square was transformed into a sea of yellow and blue. Experts in the UK have warned that the country’s Homes for Ukraine scheme risks operating as “Tinder for sex traffickers”. The warning comes as evidence emerges that UK-based criminals are targeting women and children fleeing the war. An updated tally on the total deaths of civilians in Ukraine thus far, according to the United Nations: It is 1am in Ukraine and Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are deploying white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports can’t be confirmed, this is not the first time Ukraine has talked about Russia using white phosphorus in the invasion. This week, Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Nato leaders that “there were phosphorus bombs, phosphorus Russian bombs”. “Adults were killed again and children were killed again,” he said. White phosphorus is used in war for a number of reasons – when a munition containing it explodes, the chemical inside creates a thick white cloud that many countries have utilized as a way to create a smokescreen for cover or to send a signal to troops. But white phosphorous burns at the extremely high temperature of 800C or above, meaning that it could burn straight through to the bone if it were to come into contact with human flesh. It can also enter the bloodstream with prolonged exposure and poison organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys and cause multiple organ failure. The smoke created by the substance itself can also damage the lungs. When asked about Zelenskiy’s comments on Russia using phosphorus bombs, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia “has never violated international conventions”.

The British government has so far imposed sanctions on banks with total assets of £500bn ($658.65bn) and on oligarchs and family members with a net worth of more than £150bn pounds. Sanctions could be lifted in the event of “a full ceasefire and withdrawal”, said Truss. “What we know is that Russia signed up to multiple agreements they simply don’t comply with. So there needs to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever,” she said. “Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used.” In the latest tally on the destruction wrought so far in Ukraine, the Ukraine minister for communities and territories development is reporting that Russian troops have destroyed an estimated 4,500 residential buildings, 100 businesses, 400 educational institutions and 150 health facilities. Joe Biden sparked some concerns when he said in his fiery speech today in Poland that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. Some said that statement skewed uncomfortably close to calling for a regime change, despite Biden’s foreign policy being firmly against a US-involved regime change. The White House immediately had to walk his statement back, saying that his point “was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region”. This newest development is sure to raise some eyebrows in Moscow as well: a White House readout said that Biden took a phone call on Air Force One with democratic opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya of Belarus. During the phone call, Biden thanked Tsikhanouskaya for attending his speech in Warsaw and “underscored the continued support of the United States for the Belarusian people in defending and advancing human rights, including freedom of expression, and free and fair elections”. Belarus is one of the few allies that Russia has right now. Under Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, reports of torture and mass arrests of political dissidents have been widespread. In December, Tsikhanouskaya’s husband was sentenced to 18 years in prison for challenging Lukashenko, charged with organizing mass unrest and inciting social hatred as he campaigned to run for president. Tsikhanouskaya took his place on the ballot in August’s presidential elections that ended in accusations of vote rigging, mass street protests, and a bloody crackdown on opposition. In Prague today, a striking protest: Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has some numbers on journalists who have been killed or injured since the start of the Russian invasion: Kharkiv is likely Ukraine’s second most-shelled city after Mariupol, with bodies stacked in the courtyard of morgues and missiles and rockets raining down each day. But its people are resilient, digging deep within themselves to keep the city clean and morale high. “We are scared, but we need to show people that the situation is under control and every day we are getting closer to victory,” governor Oleh Synyehubov, told the Observer. Read more about Kharkiv here: Update on Slavutych: the mayor of the small town near the Chernobyl site has made an address saying that though the city is now officially under Russian occupation, the city’s residents met its occupiers with a mass protest and vowed to keep the city Ukrainian. The Ukrainian parliament has confirmed the attack on the nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that the nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv has been hit by Russian shelling. In Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, unarmed residents met the incoming Russian troops with a mass protest. Earlier today, the town of 25,000 residents was surrounded by Russian troops and its mayor, Yuri Fomichev, taken prisoner. After failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square on Saturday – despite deploying stun grenades and firing overhead – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. Read more here: Reuters is reporting that the US intends to provide Ukraine with an additional $100m in civilian security assistance. The funds would go toward building the capacity of the Ukrainian ministry of internal affairs with a view to “border security, sustain civil law enforcement functions, and safeguard critical governmental infrastructure,” said Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. An outdoor concert in Lviv was cut short as air raid sirens sounded – and soon afterwards the city was hit by missiles, wounding at least five. Lviv, in western Ukraine, is about 40 miles from the Polish border and has so far been spared the fighting and devastation experienced in cities located closer to Russia. Nobody was killed in the missile strikes on Lviv today, according to Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv. Reuters is reporting that the missiles were fired from the Sevastopol in Crimea. Maksym Kozytskyy, the governor of the Lviv region, said that the strikes hit a fuel depot and a defence facility. Though no one was killed, five people were wounded. With the Russian invasion now firmly in its second month, Ukrainians fear that the northern city of Chernihiv will be the next Mariupol when it comes to death and destruction. The Associated Press is reporting that, just like Mariupol, Chernihiv is similarly blockaded and pounded from afar by Russian troops, leaving the city’s remaining residents terrified with each blast and bodies lying uncollected in the streets. “In basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,” 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar, told the Associated Press via a cellphone with a dying battery. “Food is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn’t stop,” he said. Chernihiv is located between the Desna and Dnieper rivers, straddling one of the main roads that Russian troops invading from Belarus used on 24 February for what the Kremlin hoped would be a quick hit onward to the capital, Kyiv, just 147km (91 miles) away. More than half of the city’s 280,000 residents have fled, with the mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, estimating the death toll from the war to be in the hundreds. This week, Russian bombs destroyed the city’s main bridge over the Desna on the road leading to Kyiv and rendered the remaining pedestrian bridge impassable, thus cutting off the last possible route for people to get out or for food and medical supplies to get in. According to Reuters, a White House official has already responded to say that Joe Biden was not calling for a regime change in Russia with his comment that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. Russia has responded to Joe Biden’s remarks that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”: In his speech tonight, Joe Biden took a strong stance in saying that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. Some critics see this simple phrase as straying into the dangerous realm of calling for a regime change, while others are cautioning those critics to remember Biden’s penchant for off-the-cuff remarks. Joe Biden also said Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”, appealing to the Russian people against the killing of innocent civilians, and telling Ukraine that the US stands with them. He told a cheering crowd: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power. God bless you all, and may God defend our freedom and may God protect our troops.” And quoting Pope John Paul II, he said: “Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” President Biden also sent a direct message to the people of Russia to say they are not the “enemy”. A free public transport scheme for Ukrainian refugees will be introduced in Northern Ireland. Infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon made the announcement on Saturday, confirming that all Ukrainian refugees arriving in Northern Ireland will be able to receive free public transport from their point of entry to a final destination. The temporary scheme will begin on all Translink bus and rail services from 30 March, PA reports. Mallon said: “In the last few weeks, many Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have been forced to make the heart-breaking decision to leave their homes and their loved ones behind in search of safety. “While many of those refugees are staying in neighbouring countries, some will be travelling to Northern Ireland to join family members or their host family.” Sanctions have been sapping Russia’s strength and its currency has been reduced to rubble, President Biden added. He said: “As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the rouble almost was immediately reduced to rubble.” To applause, the American leader added: “That’s true by the way - it takes about 200 roubles to equal one dollar.” He added: “These international sanctions are sapping Russia’s strength, its ability to replenish its military and its ability to project power. “And it is Putin, it is Vladimir Putin, who is to blame. Period.” Biden’s speech in Poland has now concluded. Joe Biden said Russia had been “bent on violence” and insisted there was “simply no justification or provocation” for the invasion. The US President said: “There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war. “It’s an example of one of the oldest human impulses, using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control. “It’s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War Two.” Issuing a message to the people of Ukraine, President Biden said: “We stand with you – period.” President Biden also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of issuing “obscene” lies when falsely claiming he was working to de-nazify Ukraine with his invasion. The US president said: “Today, Russia has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere, not only in his homeland. “Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, he has invalidated neighbouring nations. “Putin has the gall to say he’s de-nazifying Ukraine. It’s a lie, it’s just cynical - he knows that. “And it’s also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, he’s Jewish, his father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity - like all autocrats before him - to believe that might will make right.” Biden said that Nato is a defensive alliance and it has never sought Russia’s demise. He added that “swift and punishing” costs are the only solutions that will get Russia to change its course. The US president, Joe Biden, said we must “steel ourselves” for a “long fight ahead” in Russia’s war with Ukraine. Speaking in Poland, Biden said: “In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days, or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.” Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko has told thousands of protesters in central London, including politicians and celebrities, to “keep together” with Ukraine. Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, speaking from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson’s Column: “We defend right now the same principles. “Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine.” In an online post, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy said no residential buildings had been hit by the strikes in the city which he said had set fire to a industrial facility storing fuel. Reuters witnesses in central Lviv saw heavy black smoke rising from the northeast side of the city and a strong smell of burning filled the air. Men huddled together on the street to watch a plume of dark smoke rising behind an apartment block. Most residents appeared to stay indoors, peeking out from behind curtains as others hurried past on the road carrying their bags. Professional clown Serhii Shershun has swapped the big top for a checkpoint in Kyiv. More used to juggling and miming, the 50-year-old now totes a machine-gun as part of Ukraine’s huge mobilisation of civil defence volunteers. “I am against the enemy coming to my land and killing my people, my friends, my children, and the women - it’s not right,” he told AFP. Going by the professional name of ShiSh, Shershun says his wife is also a clown while his sons are taking up the trade as well, one as a juggler and the other at circus school. We were on tour, we lived a peaceful life, we made people happy, and suddenly... it stopped,” added Shershun. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will travel to Israel on Saturday and will meet with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, Blinken’s office said, in a visit that could be dominated by discussion of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bennett has been trying to mediate an end to the month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Comments by the US president, Joe Biden, about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin narrow the prospects for mending ties between the two countries, Tass news agency cited a Kremlin spokesman. President Biden referred to Putin as a “butcher” during a visit to Nato ally Poland and said he was not sure Russia was changing its strategy in Ukraine, despite getting bogged down in some areas, Reuters reports. Five people were wounded after two rocket strikes hit Ukraine’s western city of Lviv on Saturday, regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. Local authorities told residents to seek shelter in the wake of the powerful blasts on the city’s outskirts. “There have been two rocket strikes within the (city) limits of Lviv,” Kozytskyy said in an online post. Earlier he had reported three powerful explosions in the eastern edge of Lviv, Reuters reports. Here’s a summary of the most recent developments: Russian forces took control of the town of Slavutych, where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live. The governor of Kyiv region Oleksandr Pavlyuk was quoted by Reuters as saying troops had occupied the hospital in Slavutych and kidnapped the mayor. The US president Joe Biden held talks with Polish and Ukrainian leaders in Warsaw. The White House said they discussed how the US could further support Ukraine in its desperate battle against the Russian invasion. And the Ukrainians said he had pledged “further defence cooperation”. Shortly after Biden met US troops on the Polish side of the border, the nearby Ukrainian city of Lviv was struck by several missiles. It appeared one of the targets may have been an oil refinery around a mile east of Lviv’s city centre, while one missile landed close to the city’s communications tower. The city has so far been spared the worst of the Russian onslaught. The Kremlin again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, warned that Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons. Here’s a summary of the day’s earlier events. That’s it from me. Thanks for reading. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over. Thousands have gathered in central London to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said had endured “unimaginable pain and suffering” over the past month. Following the rallying call by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for people everywhere to protest against the bloodshed by taking to the streets, large crowds assembled in the capital to show support for the embattled country. On their route through London, demonstrators marched beneath Yoko Ono’s Imagine Peace message on a huge electronic billboard in Piccadilly, many waving the yellow and blue of the Ukrainian flag as they passed. The advance of Russian troops means large-scale evacuations from the war-scarred town of Chernihiv are no longer possible, its mayor has said. The northern town has been a centre of fighting between Russian troops and Ukraine’s army. Earlier this week, city officials said Russian troops had deliberately targeted a key bridge linking the northern town with the capital, Kyiv, restricting opportunities to leave. Agence France-Presse reports that the local mayor, Vladislav Atroshenko, has said: “City officials can no longer arrange humanitarian corridors or evacuate the wounded,” adding that a pedestrian crossing leaving the city was under “constant” attack from Russian troops. “We are deciding on how to get the seriously injured out by any means. We can’t operate on them locally,” he said, saying some 44 people, both military and civilians were in need of medical attention. He said that more than 200 civilians had been killed in the city since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24, and that 120,000 remain in the city of an estimated pre-invasion population of nearly around 280,000. Ukrainian prosecutors earlier this month said 10 people were killed by Russian forces earlier while waiting in a line to collect bread in the northern city. Russian oligarchs are welcome in Turkey but must abide by international law in order to do any business, Reuters quotes the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu as saying. Turkey has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but opposes sanctions imposed by its Nato allies on principle. Speaking at the Doha Forum international conference, Çavuşoğlu said: If Russian oligarchs ... or any Russian citizens want to visit Turkey, of course they can. If you mean whether these oligarchs can do any business in Turkey, then of course – if it is legal and not against international law – I will consider it. If it is against international law, then that is another story. Two superyachts linked to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich have docked in Turkish resorts, Reuters reports. Western governments have targeted Abramovich and several other Russian oligarchs with sanctions as they seek to isolate the Russian president Vladimir Putin and his allies over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, was in the region just over the Polish border to meet US troops shortly before the strikes. The west of Ukraine has, until now, been lightly touched by the war, with attacks limited to strikes on a military base and an aircraft work shop. Russia’s strike on Lviv during a presidential visit will be taken as a message to the US president, who called Putin a “butcher” during his visit to Poland. The Kremlin suggested it was focusing its efforts on eastern Ukraine on Friday but the attacks will raise fresh fears that Moscow has ambitions across the country. Lviv has been hit by multiple missile strikes, Daniel Boffey writes from the western Ukrainian city. Smoke is bellowing across the city’s horizon. It appears that there were three missiles, with one landing close to the city’s communications tower. A spokesman for the military administration of Lviv region said: There were three powerful explosions near Lviv on the side of Kryvchytsy, now there is an air alarm, so keep calm and be in shelter. It appears that one of the targets may have been an oil refinery around a mile east of Lviv’s city centre. Igor Zinkevych, an official from Lviv’s city council, said: There have been three powerful explosions near Lviv ... Everyone should keep calm and stay indoors. Joe Biden has risked the wrath of Vladimir Putin by offering Ukraine extra military support as Russian troops appeared to struggle to hold even the territory it has secured since the invasion began, Daniel Boffey and Shaun Walker write. The US president’s pledge over “further defence cooperation” was said to have been made during a meeting with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw on Saturday. Biden’s administration has already made available $1bn worth of military lethal weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft systems Javelin missiles, light anti-armour weapons. Volodmyr Zelenskiy has been pushing the US to also facilitate the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland but the White House is yet to be convinced by the Ukrainian president’s arguments, fearing a widening of the conflict. The Kremlin had hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, said he did not believe that the Kremlin was downgrading its war aims. Describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion, he said: They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines. The US president, Joe Biden, and his secretaries of state and defence, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin, have met Ukraine’s foreign and defence ministers, Dmytro Kuleba, and Oleksii Reznikov, to discuss Ukraine’s military, diplomatic and humanitarian situation, the White House has said. Officials said the talked over “US efforts to rally the world in support of Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression, including through the president’s meetings this week in Belgium and the significant military and humanitarian assistance the United States is providing to Ukraine”. The White House added: They discussed further efforts to help Ukraine defend its territory. They also discussed the United States’ ongoing actions to hold President Putin accountable for Russia’s brutal aggression, in coordination with our allies and partners, including through the new sanctions actions announced by the president in Brussels on 24 March. Poland is taking a “significant” responsibility in the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, the US president, Joe Biden, said during a visit to Warsaw on Saturday, adding that the world should help lessen the burden. Biden also told his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, he views Nato’s article 5 guarantee of mutual defence between member-states as a “sacred” commitment, Reuters reported. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, as I hand back to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. I’ll be back tomorrow morning but goodbye from me for now. Nastia arrived at the Warsaw bus station late at night with nowhere to go. The 25-year-old had made the difficult decision to leave her home and family in Vinnytsia oblast in west-central Ukraine. Russian missiles had destroyed Vinnytsia’s airport, but her father could not leave because he is of fighting age, nor could her mother because she needed to care for Nastia’s two grandmothers, who are too sick to travel, Susie Armitage reports. Now in Poland, terrified and unable to reach her mother, Nastia used Telegram to message someone who might be able to help: Caitlyn Simmons, a former Peace Corps volunteer who had been Nastia’s English teacher a decade earlier. From her home in Columbus, Ohio, Simmons booked her former student a hotel room for the next day, then kept her company over Telegram while she passed a lonely night at the bus station. In the morning, Nastia’s first stop was the US embassy. “Decide who you are with” Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the European Council, pointing to a choice that is becoming increasingly hard to avoid, as the sheer violence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine crystallises the division of the world into two camps. The camp that stands with Russians is becoming easier to define with every passing day of the war. The colour-coded scoreboard at the UN general assembly in recent weeks, recording the votes on resolutions deploring the attack and calling for a ceasefire, could not have been clearer. Among the 193 member states represented on the board, there have only been five pinpricks of red opposing the motion: Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Eritrea - a tight club of autocracies and totalitarian regimes with appalling human rights records. They have been surrounded by a sea of green, the at least 140 countries who have supported expressions of rebuke at the world’s parliament. Most of them are democracies, underlining one of the themes of Joe Biden’s foreign policy outlook, that the world is approaching a decisive struggle between democracy and autocracy, whose outcome is uncertain and therefore requires the active engagement of democratic nations. Ukraine’s new agriculture minister, Mykola Solskyi, said on Saturday that Ukraine’s ability to export grains was getting worse by the day and would only improve if the war with Russia ended. Speaking in a televised briefing, Solskyi said Ukraine, one of the world’s top grain producers, would normally be exporting 4-5 million tonnes of grain per month - a volume that has fallen to just a few hundred-thousand tonnes. He said: The impact [on global markets] is direct, dramatic and large. And it continues. Every day the situation will become more and more difficult. Ukraine has received additional security pledges from the United States on developing defence cooperation, its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Saturday. “We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defence co-operation will evolve,” Kuleba told reporters, the Reuters news agency reported. Hello. I’m Tom Ambrose and will be with you for the next hour or so. The Kremlin again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine as Russian forces struggled to hold a key city in the south the country. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons while Vladimir Putin’s defence minster claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority. The comments on Saturday prompted Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in an appearance by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet. Russia has approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads – the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. In an interview on Saturday, Medvedev said Russia’s nuclear doctrine did not require an enemy state to use such weapons first. He said: We have a special document on nuclear deterrence. This document clearly indicates the grounds on which the Russian Federation is entitled to use nuclear weapons. There are a few of them, let me remind them to you. Number one is the situation when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies. The third is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralysed our nuclear deterrent forces. And the fourth case is when an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons. Medvedev added that there was a “determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence”. The UK’s defence attaché, Air Vice-Marshal Mick Smeath has said Russian forces are continuing to avoid urban warfare in favour of bombarding civilian areas of the cities they are attacking. The Ministry of Defence’s defence intelligence says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralise defending forces. It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties. The US president, Joe Biden, has arrived at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw for talks with his counterpart the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, that will focus partly on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden has been arguing that the “free world” opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and that there is unity among major economies on the need to stop Vladimir Putin. His trip to Warsaw includes meetings with the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and its defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov – his first face-to-face meeting with top Ukrainian officials since the start of the war. Last week, we reported on the death of the Ukrainian gay rights activist Elya Shchemur, who was killed during Russian shelling in Kharkiv. Her colleagues at NGO Women’s Association Sphere have been in touch with a statement in her memory. On 17 March 2022, the 22nd day of the escalation of the Russian military invasion in Ukraine, the body of the activist of KharkivPride and the volunteer of feminist and LGBT+ movements Elvira (Elya) Shchemur was retrieved from the rubble of the Kharkiv administrative building. We started our work in 2020. Together, we staged a number of Pride performances in the city. Since then, Elya was actively involved in the preparation of different actions, fearlessly participating in public events. She was sincerely devoted to our common goal and kept on fighting for human rights in Ukraine. Our last common action was the “Hell Nicholas” (opposed to St Nicholas) at the General Consulate of the Russian Federation in Kharkiv, where we presented an antimilitary message from the LGBT+ community to President Putin. Elya joined the volunteer unit, started helping barely an hour into the invasion and died at its headquarters as a consequence of the bombing of Kharkiv city centre. We will remember Elya as energetic, motivated, positive and certainly inspiring. She will remain in our hearts this way. The US president, Joe Biden, is scheduled to give a major speech on the Ukraine crisis in Warsaw on Saturday, where he is expected to argue that Europe, Nato, and the world’s economies are unified against Russian aggression. Biden’s speech will probably meet an extremely receptive audience in a country whose history has made it pro-American, pro-Nato, and vigilant against Russia. Appeals to the “free world” are not viewed as cynically here as they sometimes are in western Europe. Freedom is a hard-won and fragile achievement in Poland, though the country’s commitment to liberal democracy has been tested in recent years by a tide of rightwing populism and reactionary Catholicism; the president Andrzej Duda’s governing Law and Justice party has been hostile to LGBT rights and independent media and tightened control over the judiciary. Over the past several months, the US has bolstered its eastern European allies with the temporary deployment of thousands of additional US troops in Poland, Germany, and Romania. After some strains in its relationships with the US and the European Union in recent years, Poland – which already hosted numerous American and Nato military bases and is a cornerstone of Nato’s eastern front – is enjoying a centre-stage position. The US and Poland have sometimes disagreed about the best way to support Ukraine. Earlier this month, the US rejected a Polish proposal to send Soviet-era MiG fighter planes to Ukraine via American bases, which the White House viewed as too potentially escalatory. Similarly, when Jarosław Kaczyński – a Polish politician considered even more influential than President Duda – recently suggested that Nato deploy a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, Washington quickly and quietly swept the idea off the table. This is Biden’s second day in Poland. After stopping in Brussels to announce a plan to curb Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, Biden arrived on Friday in Rzeszów, a Polish city about an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border, where he spoke to American paratroopers and received a briefing on the humanitarian crisis. He is scheduled to meet Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw. Against most evidence to the contrary, the Russian military recently declared it has achieved the first phase of its war aims in Ukraine; observers have interpreted that statement as a possible sign that Russia is looking for a way to wind down the war. Western officials believe the Kremlin has lost eight high-level military officers since the invasion began; seven of whom have been killed. They are: Maj Gen Andrey Mordvich: killed in action Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev: killed in action Lt Gen Yakov Rezanstev: killed in action Maj Gen Vitaliy Gerasimov: killed in action Maj Gen Andrei Sukhovetsky: killed in action Maj Gen Andrey Kolesnikov: killed in action Gen Magomed Tushaev: killed in action Gen Vlaislav Yershov: sacked The mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol has said he has spoken to France’s ambassador to Ukraine about options for evacuating civilians, after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would propose to Russia a plan to help people leave. Speaking on national television, Vadym Boichenko, said the situation in the encircled city remained critical, with street fighting taking place in its centre. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has been seen chairing an army meeting and discussing weapons supplies in a video posted by his ministry, Reuters reports; the first time he had publicly been shown speaking for more than two weeks. In the video, uploaded on social media, Shoigu said he had discussed issues related to the military budget and defence orders with the finance ministry. Shoigu, who is overseeing what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine, said: We continue ahead-of-schedule delivery of weaponry and equipment by means of credits. The priorities are long-range high-precision weapons, aircraft equipment and maintenance of engagement readiness of strategic nuclear forces. The meeting was attended by top Russian army officials; including the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, who also had not been seen in public recently. Shoigu appeared on screen in a video clip of a meeting between the president, Vladimir Putin, and his security council on Thursday, but was not shown speaking. Prior to that, he had not been seen in public since 11 March, fuelling speculation about his whereabouts, Reuters reports. Kharkiv is facing perhaps the most intense Russian shelling campaign outside Mariupol. Civilians in Ukraine’s second largest city say they are being punished because troops held off Russian forces. Emma Graham-Harrison and Isobel Koshiw tell their stories: Russian forces have taken control of the town of Slavutych, where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, the governor of Kyiv region Oleksandr Pavlyuk has said. According to Reuters, he said said Russian troops had occupied the hospital in Slavutych and kidnapped the mayor. The news agency said it could not independently verify the reports. On Friday, Ukraine said its troops had repulsed a first attack by Russian troops closing in on the town. An agreement has been reached on the establishment of 10 humanitarian corridors on Saturday to evacuate civilians from frontline towns and cities, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Speaking on national television, she said civilians trying to leave the besieged southern port of Mariupol would have to leave in private cars as Russian forces were not letting buses through their checkpoints around the southern port city. The Reuters news agency reported that it could not independently verify this information. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame when humanitarian corridors have failed to work in recent weeks. Lubkivskyi said he believes Kyiv’s forces could seize back Kherson, the first major city the invading forces took control of. I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities. An adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister remains sceptical over the Kremlin’s claims but has said the invading forces do appear focused on the east of the nation now. Markian Lubkivskyi has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We cannot believe the statements from Moscow because there’s still a lot of untruth and lies from that side. That’s why we understand the goal of (Vladimir) Putin still is the whole of Ukraine. And the last information we got from the ground, a lot of attacks from the air from Ukrainian cities. That’s why I can’t say the information coming from Moscow is correct, because we see a difference. We can see now that the enemy is focused on the eastern part of Ukraine but we are ready for any kind of attacks in different Ukrainian places. In the UK, a government minister has warned that Moscow’s claims should be treated sceptically after hints at a possible scaling back of the conflict. Representing the UK government, the policing minister Kit Maltouse told BBC Breakfast: I’m not qualified to say, but what I do know is there’s an awful lot of misinformation and disinformation flying around in this awful conflict. And we need to take care that what first appears may not in fact be the truth. Let’s hope there may well be a cessation of hostilities as soon as possible. He said refugees have arrived in the UK through the homes for Ukraine scheme, but said the number would not be published until “next week”. He said 20,100 visas had been granted through the extended family route, with another 35,000 “in the process”. The government has been heavily criticised for its reluctance to take in Ukrainians seeking refuge and for placing much of the burden of dealing with the issue on individuals. It’s now 10.10 am in Ukraine. Here is a recap of where the crisis now stands: Joe Biden will argue that the “free world” is united in its efforts to support the Ukrainian people, in a speech to be delivered on Saturday during his visit to Poland. Biden will also talk of efforts to hold Russia accountable “for its brutal war” and defend “a future that is rooted in democratic principles”, the White House said in a statement. In a video address on Friday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had “dealt powerful blows” to Russian troops, adding that their success in repelling attacks was leading the Russian leadership “to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary.” He reiterated Ukraine’s terms, including sovereignty and territorial integrity. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry said the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, and that its forces would focus on the “liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. The comments prompted speculation that Russia is scaling back its ambitions. Russia also said 1,351 of its soldiers have died in combat. Zelenskiy has claimed at least 16,000 Russians have been killed. The UK’s ministry of defence warned on Saturday morning that it appeared likely Russia “will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.” Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, it said. According to a briefing by a US official on Friday, Russia does not at the moment appear to be pursuing a ground offensive towards Kyiv. The official added: “They are digging in, they are establishing defensive positions, they don’t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground.” Airstrikes on Kyiv, however, were ongoing. The immense human cost of the war has continued to mount. The Russian invasion has killed 136 children so far, while a further 199 children have been injured, according to an update posted on Facebook on Saturday by the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. It is not possible to verify these figures. The UN rights office on Friday said that it had confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries. I’m now handing over to my colleague in London, Kevin Rawlinson. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on energy producing countries to increase output so that Russia cannot use its oil and gas wealth to “blackmail” other nations, reports Reuters. Addressing the Doha Forum international conference via video link on Saturday, Zelenskiy said no country is insured against shocks from disruptions to food supply happening because of Russia’s invasion of his country. Russian ex-president and deputy head of the security council Dmitry Medvedev has said western sanctions against Russian businesses will not influence Moscow or prompt popular discontent. Reuters has published a summary of his comments, which were made in an interview with Russia’s RIA news agency: The west has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, but one month into the war, the Kremlin says it will continue the assault until it accomplishes its goals of Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and denazification”. “Let us ask ourselves: can any of these major businessmen have even the tiniest quantum of influence of the position of the country’s leadership?” Medvedev said. “I openly tell you: no, no way.” Medvedev said there are several grounds under which Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons, including an attack on the country or encroachment on infrastructure as a result of which Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces would be paralysed. That demonstrated Russia’s “determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence,” he said. However, negotiations – even in the most difficult situations such as those around Ukraine – are Moscow’s preferred path to proceed, he added. Medvedev said opinion polls showed three-quarters of Russians supported the Kremlin’s decision to carry out a military operation in Ukraine and even more supported the president, Vladimir Putin. While downplaying the economic impact of sanctions, Medvedev said the Russian government would have to find “adequate solutions” on its own to spur the development of the aircraft, automotive and IT industries, among others. The UK ministry of defence has posted its latest intelligence update, warning that Russia is likely to continue to use heavy firepower on urban areas “as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses”. Here is the MoD’s latest analysis: Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large-scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralise defending forces. It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties. The war in Ukraine has killed 136 children so far, while a further 199 children have been injured, according to an update posted on Facebook by the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. It is not possible to verify these figures. On Friday, the UN rights office said that it had confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s defence ministry has said its forces have continued to defend the capital, Kyiv, against Russian attacks, and claimed Russian troops were struggling to “maintain the necessary pace of combat and achieve the ultimate goal of the war”. In a statement, the ministry said Russian forces were facing challenges in replacing personnel and supplies, due partly to international sanctions. Russian equipment was in a poor condition after being kept in long-term storage, it said. Airstrikes by Russian forces had continued, however, the ministry added. In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, it claimed Ukrainian forces had destroyed eight Russian tanks, as well as shooting down three planes and three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These claims have not been verified. In a video address on Friday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there must be serious conversations to end the war. He reiterated Ukraine’s terms, including sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underlined that conditions should be “fair”. Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainians who have fought against the Russian invasion, stating: “Over the past week, our heroic armed forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy, significant losses.” He said more than 16,000 Russians have been killed, including commanders. Russia says 1,351 soldiers have died in combat. “The armed forces continue to repel enemy attacks, in the south of the country, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction and in the Kyiv region,” Zelenskiy said. “By restraining Russia’s actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful, urgent, fair.” The US president, Joe Biden, will say that the “free world” opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and that there is unity among major economies on the need to stop Vladimir Putin during a speech in Poland on Saturday, reports Reuters. Biden will meet with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, on Saturday, following three days of meetings with allies of the G7, European council and Nato. Reuters has further detail: Biden, who took office last year after a violently contested election, vowed to restore democracy at home and unite democracies abroad to confront autocrats including the Russian president and China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Putin’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a “special operation”, has tested that promise and threatened to inaugurate a new cold war three decades after the Soviet Union unravelled. In what US officials were billing as a major address in Poland, Biden “will deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles”, the White House said in a statement. Biden and Duda will also meet privately to discuss security matters, including questions over how to arm Ukraine. Here are some images from the past 24 hours in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. In Kharkiv, residents have faced continued Russian shelling, including of civilian buildings, according to the local authorities. On Friday, a video appeared to show civilians shelled while receiving humanitarian aid in the city. US officials said on Friday Russian forces appear to have halted their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and were focused on gaining control of the Donbas region in the south-east. Photographs captured by Associated Press show damaged buildings, including an Orthodox Church, at Yasnohorodka, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv. The Ukrainian army stopped the advance of the Russian army in the area, according to AP. Some 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion a month ago, according to the UN. Joe Biden will spend a second day in Poland on Saturday, where he will meet with the president, Andrzej Duda, and give a speech on Russia’s invasion. On Friday, a senior US defence official briefed reporters in Warsaw on the state of the war. Here’s a recap of the key points: The US has observed more than 1,250 missile launches since the start of the invasion. It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offensive towards Kyiv, but “they are digging in, they are establishing defensive positions, they don’t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground”. The US is still observing airstrikes on Kyiv, but nothing on the ground “in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritise the eastern part of the country”. “We’re seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offence around Kyiv. That includes to the west of it ... The Russians are in a defensive position around Kyiv on the ground.” Asked if the US has seen indications that Vladimir Putin has become more reckless in his tactics as Russia has not achieved its goals, the senior official said: “You can see for yourself how they have tried to make up for the fact that they haven’t been able to move well on the ground by the increasing use of airstrikes and missile strikes and artillery strikes on population centres.” You can read the full remarks from the background briefing here. On Friday, Russia’s defence ministry said the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, and that its forces would focus on the “liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Has President Vladimir Putin scaled back his ambitions in Ukraine? He has previously stated his aim was to “denazify” the government and “liberate” the Donbas. Associated Press has the following analysis: The dug-in defensive positions taken recently by some Russian forces near Kyiv indicate a recognition of the surprisingly stout Ukrainian resistance. On the other hand, Russian forces might be aiming to continue the war with a narrower focus, not necessarily as an endgame but as a way of regrouping from early failures and using the Donbas as a new starting point, one US analyst said. AP writes that Russian forces are under great pressure in many areas of the country, and that US and others are accelerating their transfer of arms and supplies to Ukraine. A month of fighting has left Russian forces stalled in much of the country, including on their paths toward Kyiv. A senior US defence official said Russian ground forces in the past few days have shown little interest in moving on Kyiv, though they are keeping up airstrikes on the capital. “At least for the moment, they don’t appear to want to pursue Kyiv as aggressively, or frankly at all. They are focused on the Donbas,” the official said. Hello, it’s Rebecca Ratcliffe with you as we continue our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It’s now 6am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of how the crisis currently stands: In a video address late on Friday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reiterated the need for peace talks and said his country’s forces had delivered “powerful blows” to Russia. “By restraining Russia’s actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful, urgent, fair,” he said, adding Ukraine would not give up territory. The Russian defence ministry earlier said the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, saying the country will focus on the “liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. The comments appeared to suggest a downgrading of its objectives. Joe Biden is visiting Poland, in a show of support for eastern European states. He will meet with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, on Saturday, as well as with Ukrainian refugees and the Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, to discuss relief efforts. Poland has received more than 2.2 million refugees from Ukraine. The immense human toll of the war continues to escalate. The UN said a confirmed 1,081 civilians had died and 1,707 had been injured, with the real toll expected to be significantly higher. Authorities in Mariupol have said as many as 300 people were killed in a Russian bombing of a theatre last week, putting a death toll for the first time on the deadliest single attack since Moscow launched its invasion. Putin on Friday signed into law a bill introducing jail terms of up to 15 years for publishing “fake” information about any of Russia’s actions abroad. On Friday, he also claimed the west was supposedly discriminating against Russian culture, comparing the treatment of Russian cultural figures to that of the “cancelled” Harry Potter author JK Rowling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/nov/10/australia-news-live-rba-energy-prices-windfall-profits-tax-cost-of-living-politics-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-reserve-bank","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T07:31:05Z","webTitle":"Greens claim treasurer ‘dodged’ housing scheme question – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/10/australia-news-live-rba-energy-prices-windfall-profits-tax-cost-of-living-politics-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-reserve-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/nov/10/australia-news-live-rba-energy-prices-windfall-profits-tax-cost-of-living-politics-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-reserve-bank","fields":{"headline":"Greens claim treasurer ‘dodged’ housing scheme question – as it happened","bodyText":"Can you believe it? We’ve made it to the end of another sitting week in one piece. Here are the major developments of the day. Labor’s industrial relations bill has passed the House of Representatives, after further government concessions paring back the expansion of multi-employer bargaining. The Joint Select Committee have given “unanimous” support to the national anti-corruption commission bill, while independent MP Helen Haines and the Greens signalled they would move for amendments in the Senate. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has announced a review into the program to resettle former Afghan employees who assisted Australia in Afghanistan. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) revealed it received more than 1,300 complaints about doctors and medical professionals over Covid-related misbehaviour such as spreading conspiracy theories or flouting public health orders. After investigations, 28 had been subjected to “immediate action”. A small number, about 2,800, of Virgin Australia’s Velocity frequent flyer customers have been caught up in the Medibank data breach, the airline has announced. Meanwhile, the ACCC says the number of scams reported to the regulator in the current financial year is up 92%, with almost $500m in losses reported in the four months since July 1. And as the nation grapples with rising Covid cases, Queensland has moved its traffic light system to “amber”, recommending the return of masks to some settings. Independent MP Monique Ryan says Australia is “sleepwalking” into the wave. The minister for finance, Katy Gallagher, says the decision of hackers to release Medibank information related to abortion is “sickening and appalling”. On Thursday morning, on a dark web blog linked to the REvil Russian ransomware group, the attacker posted a file labelled “abortions” alongside claims they had sought US$10m from Medibank to prevent the leak of the data. BoM summer outlook: warmer days for Tasmania and more rain for the east The Bureau of Meteorology has released its latest climate outlook. Shocking none, a wetter than expected summer is likely for much of eastern Australia. Warmer days are likely for Tasmania, central and northern Australia, and cooler days are likely for the south-eastern mainland. The outlook is driven by La Niña, a negative Indian Ocean dipole event, a positive phase of the southern annular mode and record warm waters around Australia. The BoM: December to February rainfall is likely to be above median for large parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and eastern Tasmania. Northern Queensland has at least twice the average chance of unusually high rainfall. Below-median rainfall is likely for large parts of Western Australia and the western Top End. December to February maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for Tasmania, and most of western and central Australia. Below-median temperatures are likely for south-eastern parts of Queensland, central and eastern New South Wales, and parts of Victoria. December to February minimum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of Australia. Areas where this is not the case are the north-west coast and southern interior of Western Australia, and the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, extending into southern parts of Queensland. Fencing failure allowed lions to escape exhibit, Taronga review finds Remember that brief but extremely exciting moment when lions were on the loose in Sydney? We have answers. Taronga Zoo says failed clamps that join wire cables were behind the escape. Preliminary independent engineering advice has confirmed that swages (clamps that join wire cables together) failed, enabling a lacing cable that connects the fence mesh to a tension cable to unravel. The lions were then able to create and squeeze through a gap. The preliminary review has recommended the engagement of an independent tensile-structure engineer to conduct detailed investigations and provide specialist advice on the failure and repair. The ongoing review also found that while inside their exhibit, the lions played and interacted with the fence for approximately 20 minutes before four cubs, and later adult male Ato, were able to breach it. Lioness Maya and one cub chose to remain in the exhibit. Lioness Maya and the cub who chose to remain in the exhibit were recalled into their dens by keepers. The review is ongoing. Independent member for Kooyong Monique Ryan says Australia is “sleepwalking” into the latest Covid wave in the absence of a national strategy to deal with the pandemic. Here’s what Greens Senator David Shoebridge, the party’s justice spokesperson, had to say about the unanimous support of the national anti-corruption commission bill announced today. He echoed Helen Haines’ sentiment that the party would move amendments to the bill in the Senate while supporting it in principle. This unanimous report is a landmark moment, and shows we have the numbers to deliver a Federal ICAC with teeth before the end of the year. The overwhelming evidence supported removing the “exceptional circumstances” test for public hearings. Former judges, past and current ICAC commissioners, transparency advocates all want this fixed and we’ll be moving amendments to do this in the Senate. Doctors Without Borders welcomes review of Australia’s Afghan locally engaged employee program Some more on the announcement earlier today that the Australian will conduct a rapid review into the program to resettle former Afghan employees who assisted Australia in Afghanistan. Simon Eccleshall, the head of programs for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) Australia, said the organisation “welcomes the Australian Government’s announcement today that it is conducting a rapid review of the Afghan Locally Engaged Employee (LEE) program that supports humanitarian resettlement in Australia”. MSF is acutely aware of the risks faced by Afghans who worked with Australian and other foreign missions, militaries and aid organisations, and would stress the importance of including aid workers in any revised LEE definition. MSF highlights the threat posed by the Islamic State, which released a publication in August 2022 condemning the work of international medical organisations in Afghanistan, threatening the lives of local and international humanitarian workers and medical staff. MSF views this announcement as a demonstration of the Australian Government’s commitment to a broader shift in refugee and asylum seeker policy, and calls on the Government to fast track the implementation of their election promise to restore permanent protection for all refugees in Australia. Earlier today, foreign minister Penny Wong announced a review of the ‘locally engaged employee’ (LEE) program, run by the former government, of which she has been highly critical. She told a Senate estimates committee hearing this afternoon that in some cases the former government got caught up in “legalism” about the employment arrangements. Wong said the Taliban - which seized control of Afghanistan’s capital Kabul in August last year - didn’t stop to check whether a person had been directly employed by a specific department or had been engaged by a subcontractor. Announcing the review, Wong said: I have got the agreement of Dr Vivienne Thom … who will lead an independent review into the Afghan locally engaged employee program and I hope as a consequence of that we can make changes necessary to deal with the concerns which were raised both publicly by family members and LEEs themselves but also identified by the Senate inquiry [during the previous parliament]. Rain and storms forecast to hit central and eastern Australia The Bureau of Meteorology has warned “warm and unsettled conditions” are bringing widespread rain and storms across central and eastern Australia which will increase over the weekend with possible renewed flooding. Parts of New South Wales are already experiencing flooding. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals of 91mm were observed at Dorunda in far north Queensland, while wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h were recorded in Cloncurry. The BoM: On Thursday, a surface trough over South Australia will move into western parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and showers and thunderstorms will extend east through the day, including Tasmania. Severe thunderstorms are also possible across western parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and eastern South Australia and may produce damaging wind gusts, flash flooding and large hail. The BoM warned there was a “high to extreme” pollen risk across Victoria in the coming days due to the thunderstorms, which will raise the risk of asthma throughout Thursday. The BoM: Showers and thunderstorms will continue in coming days across large parts of central and eastern Australia, along with humid conditions. A significant band of rain and thunderstorms with a cold front will develop on Saturday, and then move over the eastern states from Sunday. This system has the potential to bring moderate to heavy falls that may impact already flood-affected communities. Major flood warnings continue across several rivers in northern Victoria and inland New South Wales, while minor to moderate flooding continues through other parts of eastern Australia. New acting president of the Fair Work Commission Employment minister Tony Burke has announced Adam Hatcher SC will serve as acting president of the Fair Work Commission. Burke: Hatcher has provided strong leadership as Vice President of the FWC since 2013, and I thank him for agreeing to the Acting President role for three months. He brings extensive experience to the role, and I am confident he will continue to execute his duties with impartiality and diligence. Hatcher’s three month term will commence on 19 November following the retirement of the Hon Justice Iain Ross AO. Burke: On behalf of the Australian government m, I thank Justice Ross for his stewardship of the FWC as President since 2012. The FWC will remain fair and just, transparent and open under this Government. Small nuclear reactors in Australia ‘not a competitive option’, CSIRO says The CSIRO has told Senate estimates that it isn’t investigating small modular nuclear reactors as a viable power option for Australia until at least the end of this decade, noting it isn’t currently “a competitive option”. Dr Peter Mayfield, the CSIRO’s executive director of environment, energy and resources, was asked by Labor senator Deb O’Neill about the prospects of nuclear power in the near future. The Coalition has tried to begin a debate about nuclear energy in Australia, as the Labor government pursues clean energy policies in pursuit of a net zero by 2050 goal. Mayfield flagged that CSIRO’s ‘GenCost’ report into power generation, released in July, reported “there is no prospect of a [Nuclear SMR] plant being deployed before 2030”. We don’t even look at it before 2030 because we don’t think it’s viable in that timeframe. It would need some significant cost reductions for it to become a competitive option. Asked about what Australia needs to achieve a reliable power network in coming years, Mayfield listed new clean energy options, better storage, a transition from fossil fuels which includes gas options, and carbon capture &amp; storage technology. Keep building out renewables, improve storage options we have, a transition from fossil fuels that makes sense. We believe at this point in time it needs gas for quite some time and it needs CCS in the later decades to get to net zero… CCS we see as very important as well. Greens MP accuses treasurer of dodging question on affordable housing Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather has accused the treasurer of avoiding his question over how many affordable homes will be built under a federal government scheme to build one million dwellings in five years. The Treasurer dodged my question, as much as admitting that the one million homes won’t be affordable for low income renters. We know that over the last five years the private sector built one million homes, and the housing crisis got worse. In estimates, we’ve heard that the great bulk of these million homes will be left up to the private sector to build how and wherever they will. We need public and affordable homes, not luxury apartments. Haines says proposed integrity commission a ‘good bill’ but urges government to act on committee recommendations Independent MP Helen Haines says the federal government should adopt the joint select committee recommendations on the national anti-corruption commission bill, and “consider further improvements”. The committee tasked with scrutinising the bill, of which Haines was deputy chair, handed down its report today unanimously supporting the bill with six recommendations. Haines: It was clear to the Committee that the overwhelming majority of groups and individuals supported the establishment of a national anti-corruption commission – and there was broad agreement in relation to a number of core elements of the bills. The best decisions are reached through collaboration and consensus. If the NACC is to withstand changes of government and the whims of the times, it needs multi-partisan support from the beginning. It is my sincere hope that this consensus continues beyond the Committee and that all members of this Parliament vote as one to pass this Bill. Haines said while it was a “good bill” she would move amendments when it comes up for debate. I am hopeful the Government will consider them in the same good faith way the Committee has engaged with the Bill. The Committee did not hear compelling evidence from the Government in favour of retaining the exceptional circumstances test for holding public hearings, and many experts questioned why it was necessary. Together with other members of the committee I have recommended the Government consider adding measures to increase the transparency around the budget of the NACC, and measures for a special majority of the oversight committee to approve appointments of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. She also recommended “pork barrelling” be explicitly included in the definition of corruption. Australians now expect that Government money only goes where it is politically advantageous, not where it is most needed. My recommendations would go towards improving that trust. Redress delays ‘compounds the distress’ of child sexual abuse survivors, researchers say Researchers have warned any delay in providing redress to survivors of child sexual abuse threatens to “compounds the distress many victim survivors feel”. Last week, the Guardian revealed the backlog of claims before the national redress scheme had more than doubled in two years. A rapid surge in claims this year - up from 300 per month to 700 on average in 2022 - had not been matched by any significant increase in resources or decision-making. The government announced $15m in new funding for the scheme this week. Social services minister Amanda Rishworth said the money would help better resource the scheme and help it deal with the increased demand from survivors. Swinburne University of Technology professor James Ogloff said the commitment would hopefully help to alleviate the suffering of survivors. Waiting for their applications for financial support to be finalised compounds the distress many victim survivors feel. The commitment to hire additional staff for the National Redress Scheme will help clear the claims backlog and hopefully help alleviate victims’ suffering. Albanese wraps up last question time of the parliamentary sitting The last question for the last question time this parliamentary sitting is to the prime minister Anthony Albanese, on what upcoming summits he will be attending abroad. He’s a busy bee. Tomorrow after Remembrance Day commemorations in Sydney he will travel to the Asean summit in Cambodia, followed by the G20 Bali summit in Indonesia and Apec leaders summit in Thailand. In the next fortnight, meetings have been lined up with the UK prime minister “and other friends”. He has accepted Joko Widodo’s invitation to be one of three speakers alongside prime minister Modi at the summit. As we know, the two have shared a special affinity ever since their bamboo bike ride. The treasurer will be joining me … for the beginning of the G20 in Indonesia … and I congratulate president Joko Widodo, our friend, the work that he has done in organising this summit which is an important recognition of the standing that Indonesia has as it rises along with India to be in the top economies in the world over coming decades and on that note Mr Speaker I would asked further questions be placed on the notice paper. Bowen and Pike trade barbs on cost of living and energy Liberal MP and member for Bowman Henry Pike has asked Chris Bowen a question about the “spiralling cost of living occurring under the government’s watch”. The climate minister says he is “more than happy” to answer the question “because the budget provided $20bn of funding to ensure that we rewire this country”. After years of indolence over there … we also funded 400 community batteries across Australia which will help families store the renewable energy that they generate and use it at a time and a place convenient to them because batteries store renewable energy, something the leader of the opposition has some trouble coming to terms with. Bowen says Dutton was on 2GB this morning, where he “always goes to get his toughest questions” and poo-pooed renewable energy. The leader of the opposition … still doesn’t understand that just because the sun doesn’t always shine in the winter, the wind doesn’t always blow nor does the rain always fall but we manage to store water, we manage to drink water when it is not raining. Laming says he “didn’t ask for a history lesson” but rather was asking about the cost of living. We don’t have to go back too far to be reminded of the former prime minister … who said a big battery was as useful as a big prawn. Nothing has changed over there. No King Charles III on our notes soon, RBA says WA Liberal senator Dean Smith has been pressing Michele Bullock, the RBA deputy governor, over whether or not the RBA will approve King Charles III to appear on $5 notes. As our colleague Amy Remeikis noted earlier this month, RBA governor Philip Lowe has been in talks with Labor about the matter. All Australian notes carried a monarch between 1923 and 1953, so estimates heard today. Anyway, it seems the decision will be between a depiction of the new King “or some sort of Australian-style design”, Bullock said. We shouldn’t expect an early revision of our fivers, though, with the decision likely to take 12 months at least, and require the Buck House signing off on the note should they be graced by KCIII. Perhaps pessimistically, Smith intones, “it’s quite a heavy burden for the RBA board to get wrong”. Well, right or wrong will depend on which side of the ledger you fall, Bullock says. Dutton thanks veterans on eve of Remembrance Day The leader of the opposition Peter Dutton is up. On the eve of Remembrance Day, he thanks all the veterans in the chamber for their service. To all of those veterans who will be commemorating Remembrance Day … to all of those family members … it is important we recognise their service to keep our country safe not just in generations past, but in future generations as well. Albanese says Australia has ‘fallen behind’ on climate but can be part of global shift Independent MP for Warringah Zali Steggall has asked a question about Cop27. The planet has already warmed by 1.2C but current pledges including your government’s inadequate 43% by 2030 have us on track for 3C of warming. Will your government stop making the problem worse by funding and approving further fossil fuel projects? Anthony Albanese is up. The PM thanks Steggall for her “genuine engagement on the issue of climate change”. As the member pointed out in the preamble to her question, she spoke about what was happening at Cop27 and spoke about the global effort, because indeed climate change does require a global effort. He says the previous chair of Cop27 “welcomed Australia back” as part of the global effort to tackle climate change, and reiterates the commitment of 43% by 2030 as a pathway to 2050 net zero – which Steggall called inadequate. Australia has fallen behind where we should be because we have had a decade of deny and delay, and we didn’t have any climate policy. This government understands that we need to deal with energy policy, transport policy, housing policy, we need to make homes more efficient, we need to change the make up of our transport network with accordance of what’s happening around the world and we need to move to the cheapest and cleanest form of the new energy which is renewables. We need to do that in partnership with the rest of the world, and I look forward to in the coming days meeting with global leaders, talking about how we co-operate. I am optimistic that the world can move. I want Australia to be a part of that and my government’s commitment is to do just that. ‘You can’t drive on a press release’: infrastructure minister defends Labor’s roads plan Nationals MP for Nicholls Sam Birrell is up and about on roads. As someone who has driven on a road recently, I can testify the situation is dire. He refers infrastructure minister Catherine King to the $9.3bn in cancelled infrastructure funding in the budget including $208m already committed by the Coalition to stage one of the Goulburn Valley highway bypass of Shepparton in his electorate. Is the government “abandoning regional Victoria”? King says Birrell “means well” but the government has inherited an “absolute mess” when it comes to the infrastructure investment pipeline. This government is investing $123bn over the next 10 years, increasing funding to regional communities by over $4bn over the next 10 years, I am very proud of that investment. She says the money for the bypass remains in the budget and Labor is “fully committed” to the project, then has a dig at the Coalition for being all about “announcement and not able to deliver”. You are more interested in getting an announcement on the papers, putting a press release out. You can’t drive on a press release. You can’t actually build a road if you don’t have enough money for it and that is the problem. GP bulk billing in the ‘worst shape’ in Medicare’s history, Mark Butler says Centre Alliance member for Mayo Rebekha Sharkie relates a story about pensioners who can’t afford medical treatments. She says “every day” she is hearing similar stories with constituents being left sick and untreated. Minister for health and aged care Mark Butler says he shares her concerns, that general practice is in the “worst shape it has been in the almost 40 year history of Medicare” and “all of the trends in general are bad”. We know that bulk billing rates have been dropping … I suspect every member of this house are talking to GPs and patients who say that billing rates are plummeting. GPs will tell them how distressed they are at having to change their bulk billing policies. We know that about one in three Australians pay a gap fee in this country and those gap fees have skyrocketed. He says this is the fault of the opposition. It is the leader of the opposition who tried to ram through attacks that make every Australian pay a fee for every consultant in general practice and when he couldn’t do that, pursue the Medicare rebate for six long years. I am not going to pretend that it is going to be a quick or an easy job to fix up nine long years of cuts and neglect but … we have already invested $160 million in a rural general package, we’ve invested more than $220 million to strengthen general practice grants which will be rolling out in the coming weeks and months and only last week again I met with the strengthening Medicare taskforce to advise the government on our investment of $250 million each and every year. Here’s a nice short and sweet exchange. Shadow minister for business Paul Fletcher asks Chris Bowen: At a time when Australia urgently needs more gas supply, why has the government funded $9.8 million over four years to activists who oppose and stop new gas projects? Bowen: We have not. Ahpra receives more than 1,300 The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) has revealed it received more than 1,300 complaints about doctors and medical professionals over Covid-related misbehaviour such as spreading conspiracy theories or flouting public health orders. In a Senate estimates hearing, Ahpra said it had taken action against 28 doctors including for actions such as not wearing masks, claiming the pandemic was fake or that vaccines were “government mind control”. But the health regulator hit back at criticisms from Liberal senators Alex Antic and Gerard Rennick, refuting allegations it was “silencing” doctors and defending its actions in taking action against practitioners working against government advice and scientific evidence. Ahpra was among government agencies appearing before the health committee in Parliament House on Thursday. CEO Martin Fletcher said it had received 1,303 notifications against 1,006 practitioners (including doctors, nurses, psychologists and other professionals) for Covid-related actions. He said after investigations, 28 had been subjected to “immediate action”: 11 were suspended from practise over spreading misinformation, with examples given such as claiming Covid was fake or that the vaccines were “government mind control”; 10 were suspended over actions including failing to comply with health orders, faking the administration of vaccines, or concerns over large-scale vaccine exemptions given to patients; while seven were not suspended but had restrictions placed upon them, such as additional supervision while on the job. Concerns were also raised about doctors giving vaccine exemptions that did not follow government guidelines, behaviour like refusing to wear masks, practising while unwell, or online conduct including “spreading conspiracy theories”, Fletcher said. In response to questions from Rennick about workers losing their jobs over refusing to get Covid vaccinations, and claims that some doctors were fearful of giving vaccine exemptions to people who reported having side-effects from the vaccine, Fletcher said Ahpra did not want doctors to be fearful of the regulatory body: But I don’t step back from the fact that our fundamental focus is on public safety and patient safety, and if concerns are raised with us about risk to safety, we’re obliged to look at them and if there’s a need for us to take regulatory action, we’ll take it. Antic asked Fletcher how Ahpra decided what was “accurate” information, to which Fletcher responded it relied on expert government advice. Antic asked whether Fletcher believed it was a “great big bureaucratic stitch-up” and a “cartel of regulatory totalitarianism”. Prof Brendan Murphy, the health department secretary and the nation’s chief medical officer during the first part of the pandemic, shot back “it’s a regulatory environment that works on the best available evidence”. Bowen bristles at Liberal MP’s question on gas prices Liberal MP and member for Fairfax Ted O’Brien is up and about on the energy crisis, running the old wives tale that Labor doesn’t know how to handle the economy. He asks energy minister Chris Bowen about a projection in the budget that gas prices will rise by 44% in two years. Since the budget, government ministers have spoken about price caps, no price caps, direct assistance, no direct assistance, extra supply, limited supply, taxes on companies, no extra company taxes on companies. Does the minister have any idea what he is doing, or is this just yet again Labor proving it doesn’t know how to manage money, doesn’t know how to manage the economy? Bowen says he is “trying to take a statesmanlike tone … but it’s hard, when you get questions like that”. Questions from an opposition about gas prices and how much they are going up, when on the day the member for Hume became the minister of energy, gas was $9.40, and at the time of the election it was $34.75! That’s pretty good! Some would say that’s fantastic! Maybe the gas companies would say that’s fantastic but Australian consumers would not. Tony Burke just got on such a roll his time expired. The question was on a motion earlier today moved by Peter Dutton on changes to enterprise bargaining. Burke says: Everybody wants to get wages moving. We kept hearing from people on each side of the debate that they want to give people pay rises. Yet there are two tests, one, are you willing to do anything about it, and secondly, we ended up with a vote that was designed to do the exact opposite. Today, in a motion moved by none other than a leader of the opposition, it said that they were calling on us to have changes to enterprise bargaining … so in the same time that this parliament was debating on the need to get wages moving with people facing higher inflation, those opposite took to a vote, took to a vote to bring back the 2020 legislation. What does it mean if you suspended the better off overall test? It means a part-time level to hospitality worker aged over 21 could see the hourly New Year’s Eve rates slashed from $46. Instead of earning $375, they would earn $166. Labor’s housing plan will increase investor ‘appeal’ for affordable homes: Chalmers Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather asks a question about the housing affordability crisis. Using the standard definition of affordable housing as used by the Victorian government where a person on a low income pays no more than 30% of the income on rent or other housing costs, what proportion of the government’s promised one million homes will be affordable? The federal government promised to build one million homes in the latest budget as part of the housing accord, including “affordable” properties. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government recognises extremely low vacancy rates and extremely high rents are hitting Australians (as a Sydney renter, this is a big mood). What we have done is brought together state and territory governments and local governments, the building industry, the … and other institutional investors to sign up to a target of affordable homes to be built from 2024- 2029, in the hope that by bringing people together, and by providing an element of government investment, we can subsidise the rental returns for builders, the community housing providers and super funds to take something which is not appealing enough to investors to make it a bit more appealing, but most importantly we have to build more housing stock. We do have a problem in this country when it comes to the supply of affordable rental properties. We are trying to do something about it, we do see a role for the commonwealth … in dealing with the problem that has been with us for too long, that is what the housing accord is all about, building more affordable properties, and that’s what we intend to do. Dreyfus says anti-corruption commission is ‘biggest integrity reform’ in decades Mark Dreyfus is up, and boy is he on a high! If you missed it, the joint select committee on the national anti-corruption commission bill tabled its unanimous report in parliament today. He takes a little trip down memory lane: On the 28 September 2022 I introduced a bill to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anti-corruption commission. On the same day a joint select committee was established to enquire into the bill. The committee called for submissions addressing the provisions of the bill and held four days of public hearings. Today Helen Haines and the deputy chair of the committee tabled its report in the house … I am delighted that the committee made up of government, opposition and cross-bench members of both houses has delivered a unanimous report today. This is the parliament at its finest, with members and senators coming together to find common ground and to find a constructive way forward. In doing so they have respected the mandate given by the Australian people on the 21 May to the Albanese government to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anti-corruption commission. Dreyfus says this is the “single biggest integrity reform” parliament has seen “for decades”. The government will now carefully consider this report and its recommendations ahead of the resumption of debate on the bill in the next session of parliament. We are determined to pass this legislation and have the commission up and running by mid 2023. Clare O’Neil ‘genuinely shocked’ at Karen Andrews question about Medibank The former minister for cybersecurity Karen Andrews asks Clare O’Neil what she, specifically, is doing for people that have been victims of the latest Medibank attack as opposed to “just expressing sympathy”. O’Neil says she is frankly shocked. It is so regrettable that at a moment like this, the opposition wants to politicise the pain and suffering of Australians. I am genuinely shocked. I have been a member of parliament for nine years and usually in moments like this, we have a rare time to come together as a parliament to help people. And I just cannot believe that people who are suffering, who have had personal information about them revealed, that you are trying to politicise this. I am just genuinely shocked. This is an incredibly embarrassing question from someone who was the minister for cybersecurity five months ago. O’Neil says Australia’s ‘smartest and toughest’ are coming for Medibank hackers Labor MP and member for Blair Shayne Neumann has asked Clare O’Neil how she is responding to the latest revelations in the Medibank attack, which included specific references to abortion. She says it was indicated yesterday the consequences of the Medibank hack were likely to get worse, and today, “those fears have been realised”. She says what has occurred is “morally reprehensible and it is criminal”. I want to say, particularly to the women whose private health information has been compromised overnight, as the minister for cybersecurity but more importantly, as a woman, this should not have happened, and I’d know this is a really difficult time. I want you to know that as a parliament and as a government, we stand with you. You are entitled to keep your health information [being kept] private and what has occurred here is morally reprehensible and it is criminal. The concerns and issues that citizens will face … have many variations. Some will need technical questions answered, some will be victims of crime, some will need … and much more vulnerable citizens who are affected here are going to require intensive case management … our focus as a parliament is on Medicare stepping up on this, but of course there are requirements here are as a government. We are very focused on how to make this easy and simple for citizens. O’Neil spoke with the Medibank CEO twice today and made it “abundantly clear” the expectations of the Australian community. They owe that people who need help are able to get it. Medibank is providing a clean one-stop shop … and it is important that that support is scalable and I received the assurance from Medibank today that if a large data dump occurs, they are fully ready to provide services when and if they are needed to Australians who need them. We are supporting that work … I want the scumbags behind this attack to know that the smartest and toughest people in this country are coming after you. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has announced a review into the program to resettle former Afghan employees who assisted Australia in Afghanistan. Wong was highly critical of the handling of the locally engaged employee (LEE) program by the former government. She told a Senate estimates committee hearing this afternoon that in some cases the former government got caught up in “legalism” about the employment arrangements. Wong said the Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan’s capital Kabul in August last year, didn’t stop to check whether a person had been directly employed by a specific department or had been engaged by a subcontractor. Announcing the review, Wong said: I have got the agreement of Dr Vivienne Thom … who will lead an independent review into the Afghan locally engaged employee program and I hope as a consequence of that we can make changes necessary to deal with the concerns which were raised both publicly by family members and LEEs themselves but also identified by the Senate inquiry [during the previous parliament]. A government statement issued a short time ago said Thom’s review would examine how program decisions were made, including the application and appeals process, record keeping and departmental resourcing. It would also consider whether the legislative instrument that underpins this program remained fit for purpose. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said in the statement: Our current and former ADF personnel have been clear about the painful impact of leaving people behind in Afghanistan. Dr Thom’s review is critical to ensuring our ADF personnel can have confidence that Australia will stand by those help us. The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, said Australia had a duty to ensure that its humanitarian efforts focused on those whose safety was most at risk, especially those who may face harm due to their involvement in Australia’s mission in Afghanistan. The Thom review is due to report back to government early next year. Meanwhile, a Dfat official said the department was currently assessing 261 applications for certification. The review was one of the recommendations of a damning Senate committee report - you can see that previous coverage here: Alright you know what time it is … question time, of course! Dreyfus says Labor committed to protecting journalists and sources On the national integrity bill, Dreyfus was asked if he agreed that journalists and whistleblowers needed more protection. He said it was a “longstanding commitment” of the Labor party to uphold press freedom: This bill contains protection for journalists. It contains protection of journalist sources. It is a longstanding commitment of the Australian Labor party. A clear commitment of this government that there should be protections for journalists. No journalist should be punished for doing their work. Independent MP Helen Haines said she was surprised at the exclusion of the exceptional circumstances test in the bill. Was this done to secure support of the Coalition? Dreyfus: We will give complete consideration to all recommendations of the committee and indeed, all of the well considered suggestions made during the course of the parliamentary hearings and submissions made. I can say very directly there have been no deals done anywhere in the parliament or the passage of this legislation. The bill that I brought to the parliament on 29 September is a bill that our government thinks is the best possible model for establishing, at long last, a national anti-corruption commission in Australia. The joint select committee on the national anti-corruption commission bill has tabled its unanimous report in parliament today. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus said the unanimous support of a committee made up of both houses, the opposition and crossbench “gives confidence” to the Australian people. I am delighted that the report is a unanimous report because it is the best possible basis for going forward in this parliament with this really important piece of legislation. It has been a long time coming. He said the bill would be brought back for debate on 21 or 22 of November. Our intention is the legislation will pass through the parliament this year so that we can then get on with the very important job of setting up the commission with a view to it commencing operations around the middle of next year. Sussan Ley labels industrial relations bill ‘extreme’ Deputy Liberal party leader Sussan Ley is not a fan of the industrial relations bill, which she labelled “extreme”. She said businesses had “abandoned” the Labor party’s legislation. We have seen lining up, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and industry, the Council of Small Businesses, the Minerals Council, the National Farmers Federation, all saying that this bill is not in a fit state to pass. The prime minister loves to list these organisations are supporting his government’s agenda. I think today Anthony Albanese needs to come into the parliament and update the house on what this very same organisations are saying about his extreme industrial relations agenda. Many thanks to the equally lovely Natasha May for keeping us informed today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine Thursday. Question time is coming up shortly. Thanks for your attention this morning, I am handing over to the lovely Caitlin Cassidy for the rest of the afternoon. Helen Haines, the member for Indi, said: The issue around the size of small business is I think a universal concern amongst virtually everyone that I have spoken to, to have had the opportunity to speak to [in the] short period of time that we have had to consider this bill. Zali Steggall, the member for Warringah, highlighted there were nuances that undermine the government’s claim that the bill was a step forward for gender pay equality: It is disingenuous of other government to claim that this is to assess feminised industries when many small businesses are run by women, and they will be the first to suffer when this legislation brings an absolute stall to sectors like childcare. Omnibus IR bill created ‘Sophie’s choice’, Scamps says We brought you the news of the government’s IR bills passing the lower house but here are some of the concerns raised by the crossbench who voted with the Coalition. Sophie Scamps, the independent member for Mackellar, said: The problem I have with the omnibus nature of the fair work legislation Amendment is that many of these excellent policies are bundled up with the more controversial ones, and this has created a Sophie’s choice when it comes to voting. As with many of my crossbench colleagues, I too have serious concerns for the consequences of this legislation will have on small business. HECS debt wiped for rural health workers The government is offering to wipe the study debt of doctors and nurses who choose to live in rural and remote areas, in an attempt to address the shortage of medical staff in the bush. Under new legislation to be introduced by the government today, eligibility will depend on the remoteness of the placement and the length of time worked. A doctor or nurse practitioner who works in a remote or very remote town for a time period of half the length of their course would have their entire HELP debt wiped. Those who live in a large, medium or small rural town for a time period equal to the whole length of their course would have their entire HELP debt wiped. The government also said that those living in “an eligible place for a period of time equivalent to half the time required is eligible to half the applicable debt reduction.” Approximately 850 doctors and nurse practitioners are expected to be attracted to rural and remote areas every year, the government predicts. The measures would be effective from the first day of the new year. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said: Zero HECS debt is a great incentive for young graduates to live and work and build their careers in rural and remote communities. The health minister, Mark Butler, indicated he thought the measure would also help make working outside the cities a more likely long term option too. We recognise the challenge of recruiting and retaining primary health care workers in rural and remote communities. These measures will make country practice a more attractive long-term career option for doctors and nurse practitioners. Guardian Australia’s rural network recently highlighted that long term solutions for the healthcare crisis in the bush could also be found in local populations, particularly by tapping into demographics like men that haven’t been part of nursing recruitment drives: RBA ‘not bankrupt’, Bullock reassures senators The Reserve Bank’s deputy governor Michele Bullock has been asked about the huge losses and negative equity of $12.4bn as of the end of June, by the National party senator Matt Canavan. We covered the big losses reported by the RBA and negative equity issue here: Anyway, Canavan asks: “Is the RBA bankrupt?” “No, the RBA is not bankrupt,” Bullock replies. As the central bank, it can print money, and so is not like a commercial bank. (Cue, phews.) The reason why the RBA has such large unrealised losses – about $37bn last financial year – is that the central bank snapped up many billions of dollars of Australian government debt during the Covid pandemic to force interest rates down. As interest rates have risen, the value of the holdings has dived if “marked to market”. Anyway, the bank plans to let most if not all the debt mature, hence the “unrealised” bit about those losses. Canavan’s fellow Queensland LNP colleague Gerard Rennick, meanwhile, was eager earlier to press the RBA to reveal its exchanges with the Bank of International Settlement (the “central bank of central banks”). That information, not surprisingly, is confidential, and the RBA is not about to cough it up. Rennick says the BIS had a “notorious history”. “They melted down the gold, Nazi gold,” Rennick said, tugging on a rather long bow when it comes to current discussions. Early childcare worker speaks on IR bill and better wages: ‘It gives us all genuine hope’ Burke finishes by inviting an early childcare worker in Canberra to speak after him: I think this story is best told by one of the workers themselves, so before we go to questions I would like to invite Laura to say a few words. She says: Hi, my name is Laura, in Canberra, I am a mum of three, and I have been an early educator for 18 years. What this Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill will mean for us is hope and I really want to thank the minister and the Albanese government for giving us this hope. It is going to give us the opportunity to see wages moving, wages that have remained on hold for the better part of a decade under the previous government. So we now have that hope that we can no longer have to work two jobs to keep our lives running. I talk with educators every day that are really struggling with the cost of living, with our wages, and what this does is it gives all of us that real genuine hope that we can keep the passion for what we do, the passion for early childhood education and care and that we can start to see a real difference in our lives and in the lives of the children we look after. So I really want to thank you again for the hope you has given us today. Peter Dutton’s IR bill amendment about ‘pay cuts’, Tony Burke says Tony Burke goes on to speak about the opposition leader Peter Dutton’s amendment: There is amendment that was moved this morning that a lot of people won’t know about. It was moved by Peter Dutton. And he called on the parliament to go back to the changes to industrial relations that were brought into this place in 2020, when Christian Porter was the minister. They were changes that allowed the full suspension of the better off overall test for two years through agreements that would remain intact for a further four years. They were about pay cuts that could last six years and more. So we had two votes, effectively, in terms of the major parties. We had a vote brought on by Peter Dutton and the Liberal party that called for sustained wage cut and we had a vote, supported in the House by the government and a number of crossbench members of parliament, that said let’s get wages moving. And in doing that, let’s prioritise those areas that have been left behind in bargaining. Tony Bourke says ‘feminised’ workplaces ‘left behind’ on bargaining and wages The minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, just spoke in Canberra after the workplace relations bill passed the lower house: Too many workplaces that have been left behind in bargaining. In particular, feminised industries. And I’m really proud that at the exact moment that the House of Representatives makes this decision, I’m standing here with these workers. Early childhood educators, workers who provided the example of how a sector where the enterprise by enterprise bargaining had been really hard and they hadn’t benefited from that system, but were able to work together across a number of workplaces and provide that great Victorian example of wage rates that are now well above the award. When wages aren’t moving, people are feeling that in every household at the moment. And we hear lots of people in this building talk about cost of living. The cost of living has two sides. It has prices and it has wages and you can’t seriously care about cost of living unless you are doing something about wages. Labor’s industrial relations legislation has passed the House of Representatives, after further government concessions paring back the expansion of multi-employer bargaining. The secure jobs, better pay bill – the most extensive changes to workplace laws in two decades – will now pass to the Senate, where ACT independent David Pocock is the swing vote who has driven a suite of changes to accommodate business concerns. The bill passed 80 votes to 56 shortly after 1pm, with independent MPs Zoe Daniel, Monique Ryan, Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie joining Labor and the Greens in favour. The Coalition, along with MPs Kate Chaney, Allegra Spender, Sophie Scamps, Helen Haines, Rebekha Sharkie and Dai Le voted against at both the second and third reading stage. Robodebt royal commission hears about Morrison’s desire for ‘welfare cop’ The robodebt inquiry also heard more details of a key meeting in 22 January 2015 when Pratt and Wilson met with the then new social services minister, Scott Morrison. Pratt did not recall Wilson being there but said it was possible she was. He also did not recall any mention of discussion about the welfare compliance measure that became robodebt, and there was no reference to it in his notes. His handwritten notes, shown to the commission, did mention the phrase “welfare cop”. Morrison had flagged in media at the time his desire for a “strong welfare cop on the beat”. Pratt said he had no knowledge of the use of income averaging – the unlawful debt raising method used in the scheme. Asked if Wilson had raised the issue of the legality of the scheme with him, Pratt said he no recollection of that, though he did not rule it out. Robodebt royal commission probes which department was ultimately responsible for scheme The former social services minister, Christian Porter, called the head of his department at the initial height of the robodebt scheme and asked words to the effect of “what the hell is this all about?”, a royal commission has been told. Finn Pratt, then the secretary of the Department of Social Services in late 2016, told the inquiry: Mr Porter might have said something in the order of, ‘What the hell is all this about?’ I think my response was ‘You are reading the same media I am. This is clearly something which DHS is doing.’ Guardian Australia reported on the controversy in a series of stories in December 2016. Pratt said he had connected Porter with the acting secretary of the Department of Human Services, because that department was running the debt recovery scheme. Kathryn Campbell, who is being called to the inquiry, was on leave at the time. The question of which department was ultimately responsible for the program is one of the key questions being asked by the royal commission. At the time, the Department of Social Services held internal advice saying the scheme was likely unlawful. However, Serena Wilson, a deputy secretary and one of a handful people who was second in charge to Pratt, said she did not share the advice with Porter, and likely didn’t share it with Pratt either. Thunderstorm asthma warning in Victoria Victorians are being warned of risk of thunderstorm asthma today, with a “high risk” warning issued for the Mallee and the Wimmera. The bureau of meteorology said there was also a moderate risk in the western and central districts, including Melbourne. A combination of high levels of grass pollen in the air and thunderstorm conditions can trigger thunderstorm asthma. The advice warning on VicEmergency says: Be aware of an increased chance of experiencing breathing difficulties or an asthma attack. Prepare now – carry your asthma reliever puffer with you at all times today. RBA’s Michele Bullock defends RBA over interest rate comments The Greens senator Nick McKim has been using Senate estimates to ask about the RBA’s accountability over statements last year that interest rates wouldn’t rise until 2024. (Let the record note that the comments were always qualified, “based on conditions and so forth”, but the message many people would have taken was the bank’s cash rate wasn’t about to budge soon.) The issue, deputy governor Michele Bullock says, was that economic conditions during Covid were “dire” and that the settings reflected that. As economies roared out of the lockdowns, supply shortages contributed to the emerging inflation. (Add Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the global energy and food price spikes, and inflation suddenly loomed large.) Bullock said: We were caught by surprise as was everyone. Nobody at the bank, though, lost their jobs over the miscalculations, she conceded. Gender and sexuality questions could be included in the next census, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics telling the Senate economics committee it is on a “journey” and the census adapts in line with changes in society. The inclusion of the question became embroiled in controversy ahead of the 2021 census after it emerged that the then assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, had expressed “a preference” for the questions not to be included. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg asked the head of the ABS, David Gruen, about its advice to the previous Coalition government. Gruen said the advice had included both “pros and cons” for asking questions about gender and sexual orientation, but had not expressed a preference, with the decision left up to the government. When pressed on what the pros and cons were for inclusion of the questions on sexuality and gender, Gruen said that the advantages were access to information of “considerable interest” for groups in the community, while the disadvantage was the inclusion of a “sensitive” question that went to a household, rather than an individual. The aspect of it that makes this more complicated than many things is that you send the census to a household and you ask someone to fill the census in, and these are highly sensitive personal pieces of information that perhaps some members of the household have not shared with other members of the household. He said that the ABS collected similar information in individual surveys, but the census was a “different kettle of fish”. The general manager of the census for the ABS, Duncan Young, said that when they had done some testing ahead of the 2021 census there had been “some confusion” with people not understanding the difference between questions about sex and gender. They thought they were being asked the same question twice; there is not a universal understanding across the community. However we are on a bit of journey here, and these things do change from census to census, and the censuses continue to adapt to the society that it is run in and we will start our public consultation process early in 2023 ... and we expect this will be an area of interest in that process. Gruen said new advice would be provided to the government “well in advance” of the 2026 census after consultation with the community. The Northern Territory Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has criticised the government’s plans to appoint an ambassador for First Nations people, sparking some heated exchanges at Senate estimates. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the position would enable connections to be made that contributed to Australia’s international influence: This is about telling the full breadth of the story about who we are. Price contended that the role was about the “continuing theme of segregation of First Nations people”. Wong replied: I reject that. It’s not about segregation. It’s about inclusion. Wong said it was elevating First Nations voices to “a place in our international story that we have not told” to date. Price suggested that it would be better to recognise everyone as Australians, saying the move was “ideologically driven”: As someone who has Indigenous heritage, I do find it divisive. Price, a long-standing critic of the plans for an Indigenous Voice to parliament and who doesn’t believe the Uluru Statement from the Heart represents the view of all Indigenous Australians, told Wong: Well, I doubt that you would accept 0.03% of the Asian community on anything with regard to any decisions made with regard to the Asian community of Australia, which is on the same sort of principle. Wong replied: Well I’ll answer that. You want to talk about my ethnicity and my heritage. I am deeply proud and deeply grateful that the Australian people have chosen to put more people from diverse backgrounds into our parliament. Price: I’m glad you’re proud. Wong: I am. I think it is a good thing for our country. You asked me a question about being Chinese so I’m responding. Price: I didn’t ask you a question on that. I put it to you that that’s what the premise is ... You would probably feel insulted if that was the case for Asian Australians and that’s the point I wanted to make. Price went on to suggest the ambassador for First Nations people was a “another international PR role for the Voice referendum internationally”. Wong said the government would continue “articulating and projecting the reality of modern Australia”, including multicultural and First Nations heritage. Reserve Bank deputy governor Michele Bullock and assistant governor Christopher Kent are appearing at Senate estimates this afternoon, with inflation and interest rates high on senators’ agendas. Interestingly, to underscore the central bank’s independence, related ministers are absent from today’s hearing. (Not sure if that applies to any other agency.) NSW Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has opened the session, with a query about whether the RBA’s leadership team has met with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, a question taken on notice. Getting into the questions about what’s causing inflation, we learn the RBA takes the projections about energy prices next year from the federal budget (rather than doing their own number crunching). The budget predicted electricity prices would rise 20% this fiscal year, most of it already turning up on bills, and another 30% next year. Gas would go up 20% in both. (Those numbers are a bit rubbery, since it’s a national number and states vary a lot, especially Western Australia with its gas reservation keeping a lid on power prices that the east can only look on with envy.) Anyway, we’ll have about two hours of hearings to cover. Not quite “strap in” but more “stay tuned”. A small number of Virgin Australia’s Velocity frequent flyer customers have been caught up in the Medibank data breach, the airline has announced. It is understood about 2,800 Velocity membership numbers have been included in the initial drop of the hacked data from Medibank being posted on the dark web. A Virgin Australia Group spokesperson said: After being notified late yesterday, Virgin Australia is acting to protect a small number of Velocity frequent flyer membership numbers [that] may have been compromised as part of the Medibank cybercrime event. As a precautionary measure, we have locked the accounts of impacted members. We are notifying impacted members this morning and are in the process of creating new membership numbers for those members. Keeping the accounts of our members safe from unauthorised activity is our priority and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. Those affected will still be able to fly, access lounges and earn points while new numbers are being issued, but will not be able to redeem points or log in online until those numbers have been replaced. Government kicks off $15m plan to increase energy efficiency of homes and businesses The federal government has begun consultation for a national energy performance strategy to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses. The government has set aside $15.2m over four years for development of a framework for demand-side improvements. The review will examine ways to both lower energy demand and improve energy performance and will consider whether energy efficiency targets should be set across the economy. Such targets already exist in countries including Japan and the European Union. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, said more energy efficient homes and businesses would take pressure off energy bills, the energy system and the climate. She said Australia was lagging behind other countries in making these kinds of improvements. We want to support affordable energy for Australians, ensuring no one gets left behind, while taking strong action on climate change. Action on the demand-side of the market will mean Australians can take control of their energy use. This is an issue directly affecting the health and welfare of our nation, including low-income and disadvantaged households, and regional communities. The government has released a discussion paper which says energy efficiency improvements – such as more efficient buildings and appliances – could significantly reduce Australia’s emissions, with residential buildings and the commercial and services sectors responsible for about 11% of Australia’s emissions. The consultation paper is seeking submissions on issues including energy efficiency targets, governance and the residential, commercial and industrial sectors until 3 February. Iran’s senior diplomat in Canberra has been “called in” by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade three times over human rights abuses in Iran. Australian officials have also told a Senate estimates hearing that they have raised “very concerning reports about intimidation of people here in the community”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the government had condemned the crackdown on protesters and the repression of women and called for a prompt and impartial investigation into death of Mahsa Amini. Marc Innes-Brown, a first assistant secretary for the Middle East Africa and Afghanistan Division, told the Senate committee: I have called in the Iranian chargé d’affaires on three occasions during this period to convey in the strongest possible terms our concerns about what has happened. I’ve also spoken to him on another occasion about very concerning reports about intimidation of people here in the community. Wong did not speculate on potential further sanctions ahead of such decisions being made, but said she understood the call for further steps. The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, said the issue of whether Magnitsky-style sanctions could be applied was “under active consideration”. The Liberal senator Claire Chandler said the Iranian community in Australia was looking for tangible action. ‘You’re asking me to foresee the future’: Wong on recognition of Palestine The Australian government does not recognise the state of Palestine but acknowledges “their future aspirations for statehood”, a Senate estimates committee hearing has been told. In both 2018 and 2021, Labor’s national conference backed a resolution that “supports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognised borders” and “calls on the next Labor government to recognise Palestine as a state”. However, those resolutions did not set a specific deadline, saying only that the party expected “that this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor government”. The Coalition’s Simon Birmingham asked the government to outline its position on the recognition of Palestine. Marc Innes-Brown, a first assistant secretary for the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, replied: The Australian government does not recognise the state of Palestine. We obviously acknowledge their future aspirations for statehood but we at this time do not recognise a state of Palestine. Wong said the government urged all sides to “resume negotiations towards a just and enduring two-state solution”. She said that principle was “part what drives the reversal” on the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Birmingham asked whether the government’s policy on Palestinian statehood would remain the same in the life of parliament absent a resolution on two-state solution. Wong said: You’re asking me to foresee the future. In a clear attempt not to be locked into a position, Wong distinguished the Labor party platform from the government’s position: The government’s position is, as Mr Innes-Brown outlined, and I’m sure you would be aware of this: obviously there are many parts of the community who feel deeply about this issue on both sides of the debate. Just as there are communities who feel deeply supportive, as the Labor party has been, of the establishment of the state of Israel and the right of Israel to live in security behind intentionally recognised borders, there are also people who have a very strong view about the lack of progress towards a two-state solution and the consequences of that for the Palestinian people. This has been a discussion in the community for many years. The resolution that the Labor party has arrived at is an expression from the national conference about the will of the national conference but a recognition that this is a matter for government. The ACCC says the number of scams reported to the regulator in the current financial year is up 92%, with almost $500m in losses reported in the four months since July 1. Under questioning from Labor senator Deb O’Neil, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Australians were losing more than $2bn a year, describing it as “both a financial loss and a source of emotional trauma” for people who were affected. We also have found that consumers, the victims, are disproportionately older than younger, so all groups you expect to be more vulnerable and experience vulnerability – the Indigenous community, the CALD [culturally and linguistically diverse] community, refugees, for instance, will receive threats of being deported if they don’t take action transfer money etc, so scammers are incredibly capable of targeting people with vulnerability, and the data we receive in our reports indicates that there is a disproportionate impact in each of these more vulnerable members of the community. She said that the number of reports received by the ACCC was more than 177,000 in just four months, with these figures suggesting a dramatic increase in the incidence of scamming. She said that the $2bn in losses last financial year was a likely underestimate. Cass-Gottlieb said the ACCC was pleased to receive a $12m government grant which it would use towards the establishment of a national anti-scam centre, whose primary task would be to “make Australia a harder target for scammers”. She said: They will target countries that they think are the most vulnerable. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says “it’s time to be alert – not alarmed” as the state has switched from green to amber in the state’s Covid-19 traffic light advice system. Winners from IR bill ‘will be the unions and lawyers’: Zali Steggall Daniel Andrews calls for federal funding to treat long Covid Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he expects state leaders will be united in calling for further commonwealth funding to treat long Covid. The state government has called for further funding for overwhelmed hospital clinics treating Victorians for long Covid but has not put a dollar figure on the requested investment. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Andrews said if the government was re-elected this month it would push for a continued partnership with the federal government for Covid support: I don’t think we’ll be on our own there. Whether it’s NSW, every state has been having really important discussions with the commonwealth government about this next phase of Covid. Last month, the federal budget revealed the equal sharing of Covid-related hospital costs would end at the end of the year, despite peak health bodies and state leaders calling for the arrangement to be extended. The industrial relations debate is grinding on in the House of Representatives, with crossbench MPs putting up (largely) doomed amendments. One detail from earlier when the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, made fresh concessions. Labor has agreed to exclude the entire commercial building and construction industry from multi-employer bargaining, replacing the clause targeting the construction union for breaches of industrial law with a general exclusion. Burke told the House this decision – likely to exclude electricians, plumbers and other trades bargaining together – was “not taken lightly”. The government does “not believe it is appropriate or necessary to extend multi-employer bargaining to this industry at this time”, he said. ACCC looking to boost gas purchasing power of small manufacturers The ACCC is also looking at ways to boost the purchasing power of small manufacturers in gas price negotiations, pointing to the potential of collective bargaining. Nationals senator Susan McDonald raised concerns about the retail end of the supply chain, saying that without any restriction on what retailers can charge, households and small manufacturers “who have the least control in the market place” would be hard hit. Gina Cass-Gottlieb reveals that the ACCC is also looking at ways to improve the purchasing power of smaller players. She said: We are considering the questions about whether there are other mechanisms for small manufacturers to participate potentially in a collective bargaining capacity in terms of an acquisition from producers so we are trying to test the question of bargaining power and improving bargaining power in multiple ways. She also said that while the initial focus of the ACCC’s work was on the “top of the supply chain”, the ACCC was also looking at the retail picture. We do watch this situation ... that at the retail level the market operates in a properly competitive fashion. If the parties are not operating in a properly competitive fashion ... we will watch it very closely and take action. The immediate focus is looking at the top of the supply chain, but we are seeking to ensure that all parties, including all parties who are users and purchasers, would also be subject to obligations. McDonald then asks about the need to increase supplies, pointing to projects in Queensland and the NSW Narrabri projects as ways to increase supply into the market. She suggests that price controls may make these projects less likely to go ahead, and asks Cass-Gottlieb her view. The ACCC chair says this view had been put forward by some producers, and it would “take them into account”. Teal independents named women of the year by Marie Claire Independent MPs elected on platforms of climate action and integrity in politics at the May federal election have been named as Women of the Year by Marie Claire magazine. The “change makers of the year” award went to (in the order they appear on the cover shot) the independent member for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, for Curtin, Kate Chaney, for Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, for North Sydney, Kylea Tink, and for Warringah, Zali Steggall. Ryan said it was an honour but that “the people of Kooyong and across Aus who sent Independents to parliament are the real change-makers”. Wong regrets lack of consultation on West Jerusalem reversal The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has conceded she had not intended to announce a change in policy on the recognition of West Jerusalem when she did. At a Senate estimates hearing, the opposition’s foreign affairs spokesman, Simon Birmingham, asked whether it was always her intention to make the announcement in mid-October: No. I don’t generally do things that way. I think you know that, Senator. I like to be a little more prepared. Wong has declined to say who authorised the change in the Dfat website on 17 October to remove the previous Morrison government’s language recognising West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. She said that change occurred “ahead of government processes”. There was a mistake made. This was not how we would have dealt with this … Let’s be clear, a mistake occurred and I’ve taken responsibility for it. Wong said cabinet made a decision the following morning – 18 October – to approve the change in government policy. She implied that the decision was fast-tracked to ensure there was no confusion about the government’s position: Cabinet made a decision that morning … A mistake was made, I took responsibility for clarifying the government’s position as quickly as possible. I thought that it was best for that to happen and, as a consequence, there were a range of consequences to that, which we’ve discussed. But the decision was made by cabinet on the morning of the announcement. As a consequence, obviously there was not the consultation and advice that would usually occur … including with Australia’s ambassador to Israel and others and it is not the process we would generally engage in or I have engaged in. A senior Dfat official told the hearing he had spoken with Australia’s ambassador to Israel, Paul Griffiths, on 17 October, around the time of the media reports. The Dfat official said he had “advised [the Australian ambassador] what the situation was at that point in time, which at that point in time there was no change in policy”. The following day Israel summoned Griffiths to a meeting to register the Israeli government’s displeasure with the cabinet decision. Asked whether a communications plan had been presented to her office, Wong said: I think self-evidently the sequence of the events has been well publicised, so it’s pretty obvious there was no communications plan. Origin shares soar after $18.4bn takeover bid lobbed Origin Energy shares have jumped by more than a third this morning after it received a takeover bid from Canadian asset manager Brookfield and LNG group MidOcean Energy. Brookfield, you may recall, made a tilt at AGL Energy in February that was rebuffed. (Although Brookfield’s partner in that bid, Mike Cannon-Brookes, later became AGL’s biggest shareholder and will have a big say over that firm’s governance at next week’s AGM.) Anyway, a takeover by Origin would place a big question mark over the timing of the company’s plan to shut Australia’s biggest coal-fired power station, the 2,880-megawatt Eraring plant, in 2025. If the consortium confirms its bid of $9 a share (compared with $5.80 of yesterday), Origin’s board would unanimously support the takeover bid. The current share price, recently at just under $8, has a bit higher to climb by the looks. More to come. ‘A mistake was made’: Wong on reversing West Jerusalem recognition The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed that the change to its website – removing the language that recognised West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel – was made on Monday 17 October. The Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, told a Senate estimates hearing that was “also the date that it was first reported by the Guardian”. Birmingham said: So it was reported within a 24-hour window or even less. Does the department have any idea how the Guardian came to be aware of the change to the website? The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, quipped: I can’t speak for the Guardian, I’m afraid. Presumably they have a good monitoring system. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the hearing it was “a deeply sensitive issue for many people in this country and elsewhere”. Wong said the majority of the international community considered the status of Jerusalem was a final status issue to be resolved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. She said Labor reinstated the longstanding bipartisan position. Wong reiterated her previous comments that the timing of the announcement was “deeply regrettable”. Referring to the website being change prior to the cabinet signing off on the change, Wong said: A mistake was made. I don’t intend in this hearing or anywhere else to point the finger of blame. I took responsibility as minister to ensure there was clarity around Australia’s position. Identifying greenwashing an ‘enduring priority’: ACCC Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is asking the ACCC about its focus on “greenwashing” where it investigates claims made by companies about their green and environmental credentials. Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb says that they are looking across the board, but focusing on claims made to consumers through advertising, with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission focused on the corporate side. Hanson-Young asked about “sweeps” of various sectors being undertaken by ACCC to identify misleading environmental claims. We are very conscious of the importance for the community to actually have trust that claims that are made for environmental sustainability are true. Cass-Gottlieb said that a sweep undertaken in October aimed to identify which claims were being made in which sectors, and what was the likely verification for such claims being made. She said the preliminary analysis of the ACCC was that there was a “higher prevalence” of potentially misleading content in the sectors of cosmetic and personal care, food and beverage, energy and fashion. Cass-Gottlieb said that identifying greenwashing would be an “enduring priority” for the ACCC. Bluey and Bananas in Pyjamas visit parliament Parliament yesterday received a few special guest visitors from some of the ABC’s most beloved children’s programs. Which left some saying the talking bananas were a “definite improvement on the characters you usually see in this place”. Australian Passport Office admits they underestimated pent-up travel demand The number of Australian passport applications in the queue has dropped from 428,000 in early September to 180,000 this week, officials have told a Senate estimates hearing. The hearing has focused on problems with passport processing following the Australian border reopening. The executive director of the Australian Passport Office (APO), Bridget Brill, said officials had anticipated an increase in passport applications after the border reopened, but it “far exceeded anyone’s expectations”: We doubled our workforce – we had already started to upscale our workforce ahead of the border reopening. We predicted we would need to at least double our staffing by May [2022], which we did. On the modelling we had done, based on the data received from the travel industry and other sources, we anticipated we were going to be able to meet the demand based on the modelling. When asked by the Labor senator Nita Green whether the modelling was wrong, Brill replied: Correct, Senator. Unfortunately, the surge in travel [and] the wish to travel internationally far exceeded anyone’s expectations around the timing of that. It was around April/May that we got demand that far exceeded what we had modelled across the scenarios. A similar thing played out in the travel sector itself. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said that on coming to office “it was very clear to us that there were passport processing delays because the post-Covid surge in applications had been inadequately prepared for”. Wong said the new government had further increased staffing and had now issued 1.4m passports: I understand Australians’ frustrations about this and staff in this area have worked very hard since the election with us to try and deal with this situation to clear the backlog. Craig Maclachlan, a Dfat deputy secretary, said the department regretted “the inconvenience caused to Australian travellers through this processing time”. He said the high point of applications that were “on hand” reached 428,000 on 7 September, but as of this week it had fallen to 180,000. He said the average processing time “has dropped from well over 30 days to about 23 days”. Any interactions with Russia at G20 summit to be used to express opposition to ‘immoral’ invasion: Dfat secretary The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has been asked about Anthony Albanese’s forthcoming attendance at summits, including the G20 in Bali next week. Wong tells the Senate estimates hearing the prime minister “will be looking to meet with as many counterparts as he is able” but she doesn’t confirm whether that will include China. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, asks whether China has made any direct requests of Australia when it comes to policy, in a series of meetings with Australia since the election. Wong said she did not propose to go into details, and neither did predecessor Marise Payne, of conversations with counterparts – but Wong added that Australia’s government has changed but its strategic policy interests have not. She said the government would not walk away from Australia’s interests. Wong said the relationship with China “has been in a difficult and challenging place for some time”: Dealing with that requires a careful considered process and strategy. In part that includes a great deal of thinking about how we publicly articulate and articulate to the PRC [People’s Republic of China] how we envisage the relationship. In order to [explain] that more clearly, including to the Australian people and publicly, I released my opening statements for each of those two bilaterals publicly ... They are, I think, clear about the issues we were raising on the face of it. The questions shift to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s potential attendance at the G20 next week. The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, said the attendance level by Russia was “yet to be made clear”. Adams said Australia would not let down the summit hosts by refusing to attend, but any interactions with Russian delegation would be “very restricted and will be used to express our clear opposition to the illegal, immoral and unacceptable invasion of Ukraine”. The government has pledged to work with Indonesia on these issues. The House of Representatives has voted on crossbench and Coalition amendments to Labor’s secure jobs, better pay bill. Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie proposed that the carveout for “small businesses” to opt out of single-interest multi-employer bargaining be expanded from businesses with 15 employees to 100 employees. That amendment was defeated 79 votes to 57, with Labor and the Greens voting together against it. Crossbenchers Bob Katter, Dai Le, Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Sophie Scamps voted with the Coalition. Procedural amendments from the Liberals and from Spender, who wanted a longer inquiry on some aspects of the bill, were also defeated. The bill got a second reading, with 80 votes to 58. On this vote: Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan voted with the government and the Greens. Spender, Tink, Chaney and Le voted against the second reading. The bill now passes into its consideration in detail phase. The leader of the House and workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is tabling a new explanatory memorandum with government amendments. These go further than was thought. The new amendments are designed to ensure the “primacy” of enterprise bargaining (between one employer and its workforce) over multi-employer bargaining. He said: Under our amendments, employers who have agreed with an employee organisation for a single enterprise agreement are exempt from the single-interest stream. The Fair Work Commission will also be able to exempt an employer from the single-interest stream if they have a “history of effective bargaining”. Victorian Labor pledges $42m for neighbourhood batteries Some news out of Victorian state politics. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has promised to install 100 neighbourhood batteries if his government is re-elected on 26 November. Foreign minister to actively offer briefings to parliamentary committee on China The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says she will actively offer briefings to federal politicians on the relationship with China, saying the previous Morrison government’s reluctance to do so was “a lost opportunity for the nation”. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is up at Senate estimates today. Wong began the session with a pledge to work closely with parliamentarians across the political divide, saying advancing the national interest is a shared responsibility. Australia could deliver a powerful message project through bipartisanship and unity of values: We need not agree on every government decision. But we should all look to the national interest first rather than partisan political interests. And in pursuit of that purpose we we should seek out ways to better prepare and brief this parliament because our democracy and our country are more robust if parliamentarians are better informed. This was my view as shadow minister and it remains my view as foreign minister. The committee will recall that in opposition I asked the Morrison government to engage the parliament more deeply to help foster unity, especially on the complex issues surrounding Australia’s relationship with China. I believe their refusal was a lost opportunity for the nation and for all of us as custodians of the national interest. So I’m being clear with the committee: I wish to take a different approach. I will routinely offer this committee briefings. If additional briefings are requested I will seek to facilitate those – and the same applies to parliamentarians generally. And I am pleased to announce a new initiative to start next year, NS23 National Security 23, which will offer national security-related training to parliamentarians – a collaborative effort between the Australian government and the national security college of the Australian National University. The recently appointed Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, who is a former Australian ambassador to China and Japan, said she wanted to lift Dfat’s capability: Conflict comes when diplomacy does not succeed. I therefore see the mission of the department as central to our national interests. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, agrees that it is important for Australia to seek bipartisanship on foreign affairs wherever possible, but he also says it is important to scrutinise government decisions. ACCC says wholesale gas and price caps ‘a possible option’ From Peter Hannam and Sarah Martin: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says it is looking at including legally binding measures to force down prices in gas negotiations as part of a new mandatory code of conduct for the gas sector. The regulator, which has been tasked by the Treasurer Jim Chalmers to come up with options for the government to consider, has also said that both retail and wholesale price caps are under consideration. Appearing before the Senate economics committee this morning, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb gave more details of what the regulator was considering, with its advice to go to government by mid November. She said: The ACCC has been asked by the Treasurer to give advice, the specific request is directed to looking at the voluntary code of conduct in respect to gas purchase negotiations and advising as to whether there are methods and options to supplement that with the intention of it becoming mandatory, so that there can be an assurance of supply with reference to reasonable pricing. So far no supplier has signed up the voluntary code, Cass-Gottlieb notes. McKim asked whether the ACCC’s scope had “hard boundaries” or whether the regulator could potentially look at capping retail prices. Cass-Gottlieb said: The initial part of the requested advice is directed to the sale of the wholesale level between producers and their purchasers who will generally be either gas power generation....commercial and industrial users and retailers, it would not be at the retail price level. [But] we are also asked a second question more generally to advise if there are any regulatory gaps relevant to the current circumstances facing the east coast gas market, so there is a possibility that the second more general one would address that [retail price caps]. McKim also asked whether capping wholesale prices of gas and coal prices was on the table. Cass-Gottleib said: It is a possible option that we will need to consider in the scale of all possible options. At present we are considering the question really in terms of the scope as framed - we are considering enhancements to what is currently a voluntary code to which no supplier has yet signed, and enhancements that would in legal terms provide greater transparency, certainty and binding outcomes. Asked by LNP senator Susan McDonald what assumptions were behind the ACCC’s July report that found eastern Australia faced a 56-petajoule shortfall in 2023 and that “every extra molecule of gas” would be exported, Cass-Gottlieb said it was based on forecasts by the producers themselves. (ACCC “did not make assumptions” about that export forecast, she added). Of course, what needs to be made clear (but is often skimmed over) is how much gas prices would drop if supply rose since east coast gas prices are linked directly to global ones. Perhaps one of the senators could ask that one. ACCC giving government advice on energy prices The consumer watchdog is up before parliamentary estimates where it has confirmed it is providing advice to the government to address high energy prices. Baby boy dies after Sydney house fire A six-week-old baby boy has died after being critically burned in a house fire in Sydney’s south-west. NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Mark Gibbs says paramedics were called to the boy’s Campbelltown home on Wednesday afternoon. He said: The baby had sustained burns to between 80 and 90% of its body and this was a very confronting scene for our paramedics. Paramedics provided treatment for the burns, alongside a specialist medical team from the Toll Ambulance Rescue helicopter. The baby was taken by road to Campbelltown hospital in a critical condition but died. A second child was assessed for smoke inhalation, but did not require further treatment. The death will be investigated and a report sent to the coroner, police said. - from AAP ‘Important to do everything … to engage in dialogue and diplomacy’ with China: Peter Khalil The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is trying to meet with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, next week. Khalil is asked where this review into former Australian defence personnel being approached by Beijing leaves diplomatic relations between the two nations: Any type of dialogue at the leadership level is a good thing. We want to be able to engage with China through dialogue, and it will be a good thing if the prime minister does meet with Xi Jinping. Of course, our foreign minister [Penny Wong] has had multiple conversations with her counterpart, Wang, and our defence minister [Richard Marles] has met with his counterpart as well. That’s good because, for us as Australians, it’s important to do everything that we can to engage in dialogue and diplomacy to reduce tensions that might exist, to address some of the issues around economic sanctions and barriers that have been placed there, and to try and get a good result or good outcomes in that respect. But we’ll always stand up for our values and our position. The prime minister has been very strong on that. He won’t be budged on, you know, our particular commitment to human rights and democracy and our values, but he’s always open to talking to our partners, and it would be a very good thing for that dialogue to occur in some of these international fora in the coming weeks. ‘Obligations are made very clear to defence personnel’: Khalil The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, has said the personnel may need to be educated about their obligations. Khalil responds to that idea, saying “more education is always good” but he believes defence personnel’s responsibilities are already made “very clear”: Education may be part of the process, absolutely. Having said that, I know for a fact that, having worked in this space in the past, that the responsibilities and the obligations are made very clear to defence personnel, people working in national security agencies, in the commonwealth public service about their responsibilities around sensitive information. I think there is a very strong level of understanding about what your responsibility is during your work, but also outside of your work, and when you leave your work you sign off on a number of documents to confirm that responsibility. So, look, education - more education is always good, but certainly people know what their responsibilities are. ‘A breach of trust with your fellow Australians’: Khalil on Australians training Chinese military As the defence minister, Richard Marles, launches a review over China approaching former personnel to help train the Chinese military, the chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, Peter Khalil, spoke to ABC News. Just how concerned should Australians be about these latest revelations? Oh, I think very concerned … there is an enduring obligation, as the minister said, when you leave that service to protect that sensitive information because effectively you’re protecting Australia and fellow Australians. And when you breach that obligation, that enduring obligation, that is really a breach of trust with your fellow Australians, so it’s seriously concerning. The government did move very speedily … Yesterday [Marles] pointed out there was enough serious concern that he’s gone into a much more detailed examination of the policies and procedures around former defence personnel and the way that framework works. And if there are any weaknesses, he’s going fix them pretty quickly. RBA up before estimates as China clouds gather As noted in an earlier post, the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Michele Bullock, used an evening speech to highlight that inflation is still expected to peak soon, perhaps next month. That’s even with flood impacts on farming pushing up grocery prices and the full whack of energy price increases still to land for many households and businesses. The RBA, meanwhile, will appear before Senate estimates later this morning (after the ACCC kicks off proceedings for the Treasury portfolio), so expect more grilling about whether the central bank should have acted sooner to curb inflation so we wouldn’t be jamming the brakes so hard now. (They’re reviewing their models, and rightly note that most economists didn’t pick Russia’s war, etc.) One thing worth keeping an eye on is the deteriorating Chinese economy amid a sagging property market and rolling Covid-zero policy lockdowns. As we noted in August, China’s economy was showing signs of a big slowdown. We shouldn’t lose sight of this notable stat provided by Michael Pettis, an economist at Peking University*: China’s GDP is roughly three-quarters that of the US and Europe, but the value of property assets are double those in the US and triple those in Europe. The mother of all property bubbles, it seems. Anyway, China’s producer prices fell last month for the first time in almost two years we learnt yesterday, quite at odds with most other parts of the world. Deflation is not a good sign about the health of the local economy. Not surprisingly, then, Bullock cited China as the top uncertainty in the international economy. “A significant concern from our perspective is the downside risks in China,” she said, with the real estate woes at the core. Bullock said: Residential property sales have declined sharply over the past year, and housing starts have also fallen to be lower than they have been for over a decade. The way Australia might feel the pinch directly is via lower iron ore prices, but since China is the biggest consumer of most other things dug out of the ground, the implications could end up being a lot wider. However, a flood of goods that can’t be sold at home should ease price pressures in Australia and elsewhere. * “Peking University” is the official name in English, in case you’re wondering why it’s not “Beijing University”. ‘Hallmarks of a Russian-based ransomware gang’: shadow cybersecurity minister on Medibank attack Asked about reports Russian-linked criminals are behind the Medibank hack, James Paterson responded: It’s not yet confirmed that it is Russian hackers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out to be the case. It certainly has some indications and hallmarks of a Russian-based ransomware gang. It does appear, on the face of it, to be criminal in nature at this time. It is certainly true that there is a convergence in between online criminals and nation states. It’s been revealed in previous attacks. What should Australia be doing? I think the most important is we have to demonstrate that there’s a cost for this activity. So one thing which we have done in the past is to attribute it because a lot of nation states are uncomfortable being called out on it, China included. We also need to make use of the sanctions within the Magnitsky regime, which we legislated a couple of years ago, which now allows the Australian government to sanction people from [cyber behaviour] that’s never been used. It should be used because I think that will have a powerful disincentive. If you want an explainer on the human rights sanction regime named after late corruption whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, Guardian has you covered (Australia’s legislation is modelled on the UK): ‘Safe harbour’ mechanism needed to boost company confidence to disclose cyber-attacks, opposition says Patterson says the director general the Australian Signals Directorate, Rachel Noble, is “very supportive” of his proposal for a “safe harbour” mechanism to allow companies to disclose data attacks without immediate fear of legal ramifications. Before estimates this week, I discussed with the director general the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), Rachel Noble, whether or not some kind of safe harbour is needed so that in a crisis companies have confidence that they can share information with ASD to help deal with the threat in the immediate aftermath of an attack before they have to start worrying about legal ramifications from the privacy commissioner and others. And Rachel Noble was very supportive of that idea. It’s an idea that’s been put to me by industry because they say they are anxious that their companies will think twice about whether they should cooperate to defeat the threat because they’re worried about those legal ramifications and those fines. And, if that is the case, that’s very unproductive and it will stall or an effective response to these crises. Opposition says if new Medicare card numbers needed, government should pay The shadow minister for cyber security and countering foreign interference, James Paterson, follows Bill Shorten on ABC radio, giving his two cents on this latest news of the Medibank data leak. Paterson says he welcomes the measures the government has put in place, including supporting state police. He goes on to say there are “other things that government will need to contemplate in the coming days and weeks”: My No 1 focus today is Medibank customers who will be very distressed by the news that their data appears to be leaked on the web by the hackers. They’ve made good on their threat, unfortunately. This is the worst-case scenario. There are other things that government will need to contemplate in the coming days and weeks. For example, as we saw in the Optus case, where the government issued identification, like Medicare numbers need to be reissued. If that’s the case, that should be done free and, it should be done promptly. Shorten urges victims of data breach to ‘contact us’ to replace government ID NDIS minister Bill Shorten is asked about data breaches after the latest Medibank leak as part of his ABC Radio interview. Shorten supports Medibank not giving into ransom demands, saying this would “incentivise it happening”: In terms of people whose ID is compromised, where it’s government identification, contact us, so we can help replace it and help change it. Patricia Karvelas: Will that be free of charge? Shorten: Yes, for the person. The hackers allegedly behind the theft of Medibank data linked to 9.7 million customers have revealed they allegedly demanded a US$1 per customer ransom from the health insurer. In a chilling message posted on the dark web overnight, the ransomware group also claimed it had released sensitive details of customers’ medical procedures. The post said: Added one more file abortions.csv ... Society ask us about ransom, it’s a 10 millions usd. We can make discount 9.7m 1$=1 customer. The group began releasing Medibank data on the dark web in the early hours of Wednesday morning under “good-list” and “naughty-list”. The first wave included names, birthdates, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, health claims information, Medicare numbers for Medibank’s ahm customers and passport numbers for international student clients. Medibank confirmed on Wednesday: The files appear to be a sample of the data that we earlier determined was accessed by the criminal. We expect the criminal to continue to release files on the dark web. Medibank revealed this week it had rejected hacker demands it pay a ransom in return for the data not being released. Asked what people should do if they were contacted by someone claiming to have sensitive information about them, federal minister Annika Wells reiterated the government’s advice was not to pay ransoms. She told Nine Network today: You do not pay the ransom. You’re making the assumption that that is true and what we’re saying is that may not necessarily be the case – plenty of scumbags out there are going to try and make the most of this situation. Medibank had warned more customer data would be uploaded to the dark web, which is what appears to have happened in the early hours of Thursday. Australian federal police are ramping up efforts to catch those behind the huge data breach. – from AAP Coalition’s staff cap has fuelled lack of payment integrity, Shorten says Bill Shorten goes on to criticise the NDIS staff cap implemented by the Coalition government: When there were 180,000 participants in the scheme, the staff numbers were around 3,500 to 4,000. And the government of the day said, ‘OK, no more staff.’ Now the scheme has half a million people-plus, and what’s happened is that we’ve brought in contractors or labour hire or partners in the community and the scheme hasn’t been well, in my opinion, supervised and well loved. And as a result you know, the payment system. I don’t think there’s sufficient scrutiny on the invoices that gets submitted for services which are provided. We’re going to have to put more effort into payment integrity, more effort into monitoring the invoices. ‘It was to be a 50/50 split’ RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks Bill Shorten if that means he thinks some of those kids shouldn’t be on the NDIS. Shorten: I don’t blame someone for seeking to get support for the child. What does make me wonder is the state school systems providing the support for kids with developmental and learning delays? Are they doing enough or not? How can you force their hand to do it so that these people aren’t going on the NDIS? Originally, when the NDIS was created, it was to be a 50/50 split, at the moment the federal government is paying 64% to 66% of the scheme and states are paying in the mid 30s. NDIS ‘can’t be the only lifeboat in the ocean’, Shorten says Bill Shorten goes on to say that the distribution of responsibilities for funding needs to be distributed more evenly with other bodies like state governments stepping up, so the burden doesn’t only fall on the government scheme: I also think there’s a challenge with the state’s what’s happened is now the NDIS exists, everything becomes an NDIS matter. It can’t afford to be the only lifeboat in the ocean for people with a disability. [The NDIS] was designed for the most profoundly and severely impaired Australians, not for everyone with a disability. All of the coverage of it looks at the cost and that’s legitimate, but it’s not cost in a vacuum. We are seeing improvements is half a million people who for the first time in many cases, most cases are receiving support, which previously fell to a crisis-driven system. So this is an investment and it’s delivering good returns with more kids getting better results in terms of our education. There’s more people with disabilities participating in work. We’re seeing improvement in terms of the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people and their families. Bill Shorten addresses NDIS cost blowouts The minister for the NDIS, Bill Shorten, is speaking to ABC Radio this morning about those cost blowouts to the disability scheme of up to $100bn a year predicted in last month’s budget. ABC Radio asks Shorten if the rapid growth in participants has been driving the blowouts: The scheme hasn’t been well managed in the nine years. There’s a variety of reasons why the scheme is growing at the rate it is. There are certainly more kids coming onto the scheme than was originally forecast. So that’s true. But just the point about those kids, they tend to be pretty minimal cost. So, it is a factor but I don’t think it’s the only feature, what I do think is that there has been clunky decision making within the organisation, there’s been a lack of attention on the payment side … In other words, what service providers are charging, who’s taken the scheme for a lend? My focus is not that people with disabilities, profound disabilities, are doing the wrong thing. They’re not. I do think there is rent-seeking behaviour by some providers, and not all of them, but some of them. Department of Defence officials say they are hoping to fix problems with the Guardian-class patrol boats in coming weeks after revealing an “ongoing issue” with hydrogen sulphide from the vessels’ waste management systems. Australia has so far given 15 Guardian-class patrol vessels to regional neighbours, starting with the delivery of one to Papua New Guinea in November 2018, but the government announced four months ago that it had found a number of problems, including carbon monoxide entering part of the boat. Hugh Jeffrey from the Department of Defence mentioned the hydrogen sulphide issue during questioning by the Greens senator David Shoebridge at a Senate estimates hearing last night. Hydrogen sulfide, or H2S, is a colourless toxic gas that can smell like rotten eggs: As with all new capabilities, we have some maintenance issues. There has been a specific issue in relation to H2S, a toxic gas, created by the ship’s grey-water and black-water systems. We’ve been working this issue intensively with Austal, the ship manufacturer. They have been committed to resolving this, as have we, and they’re currently trialling steps to improve the robustness of the grey-water and black-water sewerage systems on those boats. The head of maritime systems, Rear Admiral Wendy Malcolm, said Austal was “working in Cairns at the moment to trial those [steps] and subsequent to those trials proving effective over the next two to three weeks, we will look to roll out those fixes across the fleet”. She said safety was “absolutely paramount”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, added that the patrol boats were “a very important part of Australia’s engagement with and support to the Pacific” and the government was committed to fixing the problems as quickly as possible. Last week an Austal spokesperson provided Guardian Australia with an update on the other issues: Working with our component suppliers, Austal has rectified both the engine muffler and the Vulcan Engine Coupling, and also supported the Commonwealth in optimising the design to improve ventilation in the sick bay. Workplace relations minister attacks Dutton’s amendment The House of Representatives is due cast votes this morning on the government’s IR bill, including an amendment from opposition leader Peter Dutton to reintroduce the previous government’s changes to the “better off overall” test. Workplace relations minister Tony Burke has taken to social media to criticise the amendment, saying it would only cut wages. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has joined a joint employer statement urging that Labor’s industrial relations bill not be passed in its current form. This is significant because Cosboa gave conditional support for more options for multi-employer bargaining before the jobs and skills summit, signing up with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in a move that allowed workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, to say there was consensus for the idea. Consensus no more. The employers said the bill “would introduce fundamental and highly problematic changes to Australia’s bargaining system that would be detrimental to Australia”: The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Australian Industry Group; Business Council of Australia; Minerals Council of Australia; the Cosboa; and National Farmers Federation are united in a call for the Government to either abandon or substantially amend various contentious elements of the bill relating to bargaining. The bill, as currently framed, should not be passed by Parliament. We jointly call on the Government to permit time for a thorough consideration of the content and implications of the Bill. This deeper consideration should include removing the provisions to allow widespread use of multi-employer bargaining backed by strike action. The Australian Parliament should remain open to making further amendments. The legislation as drafted does not reflect broad consensus arising out of engagement with industry at the Jobs and Skills Summit or subsequent consultation. It is crucial these proposals are thoroughly examined. The council said national employer associations were particularly concerned that the bill: unjustifiably expands the scope for multi-employer bargaining; fails to articulate clear parameters around where multi-employer bargaining would be available in either the supported bargaining or single-interest streams; and undermines the system of enterprising bargaining that has delivered many significant benefits to Australia over several decades and currently operates effectively in many sectors. The currently proposed framework for arbitrating bargaining disputes also risks unreasonably subjecting broad sectors of the economy, and community, to the centralised setting of terms and conditions over and above the comprehensive system of modern awards already in place. The government is being urged to address “additional deficiencies” in the bill and to allow “detailed examination of the multi-employer bargaining elements”. Flood warnings Good morning! Natasha May on deck with you now. NSW and Victoria continue to face a weeks-long flood emergency. In NSW, the far west of the state could see flooding while in Victoria, new watch and act warnings have been issued overnight. The full list of warnings in Victoria are available here. Gas prices ‘expected to rise again’ With energy bills front and centre in consumers’ minds, it’s also clear that they are central to thinking in Martin Place right now as well. RBA deputy governor Michele Bullock said in a speech last night that the situation in Europe remained clouded in uncertainty, AAP reports: While gas prices have declined lately, they are expected to rise again, particularly if there is an unusually cold winter or Russia’s war on Ukraine escalates further. Speaking in Sydney, Bullock said high global energy prices boost Australia’s export earnings as a major coal and gas exporter – but also put upwards pressure on prices. The government has flagged regulatory intervention in the energy markets to keep gas and electricity prices down, after the October budget revealed they are expected to soar by a combined 50% over the next two financial years. Bullock said the bank had built a substantial hike in energy prices into its outlook for the economy but said “there is a risk we haven’t incorporated enough”: On the other side of the coin, however, global supply chain pressures are easing quite quickly and that could turn out to be more of a dampening force than we are currently expecting. Skyrocketing rents were another area of inflationary concern, she said. Good morning and welcome to the blog. I’m Martin Farrer, bringing you the early headlines before Natasha May takes control. There are two big foreign stories overnight that we should look at to begin with. First, the Republicans have failed to secure the resounding victories in the US midterm elections that were widely expected. Democrats did much better than predicted, leaving control of Congress in the balance. That’s also bad news for Donald Trump who reportedly fumed in his Mar-a-Lago lair as he watched several of his high-profile backers go down to defeat. Follow all the latest at our US election live blog. The second big story is that the Kremlin has ordered its troops to withdraw from Kherson. The Ukrainian city was the first large target captured by the Russians at the beginning of their invasion and their withdrawal is a huge blow to President Vladimir Putin. You can follow those developments here. At home, a poll shows that almost 90% of people want the government to do something about energy bills, either through export controls or a windfall profits tax, or both. It comes after Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy also backed the need for intervention in the energy sector. Interesting as well that RBA deputy governor Michele Bullock said in a speech last night that the situation in Europe remained clouded in uncertainty and that energy prices could rise rapidly again. And we’ve also got a cracking story from the campaign trail in Victoria where it has emerged that deputy Liberal leader David Southwick has used his campaign manager and a part-time staffer in campaign ads to attract young voters – without declaring that they work for him. Also today, Chris Dawson, the former teacher found guilty of murdering his wife Lynette 40 years ago, will be back in court to hear arguments about what sentence he should be given."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/07/power-mini-nuclear-plants-cost-more-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T15:30:54Z","webTitle":"Power from mini nuclear plants 'would cost more than from large ones'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/07/power-mini-nuclear-plants-cost-more-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/07/power-mini-nuclear-plants-cost-more-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"Power from mini nuclear plants 'would cost more than from large ones'","bodyText":"Electricity from the first mini nuclear power stations in Britain would be likely to be more expensive than from large atomic plants such as Hinkley Point C, according to a government study. Power from small modular reactors (SMRs) would cost nearly one-third more than conventional large ones in 2031, the report found, because of reduced economies of scale and the costs of deploying first-of-a-kind technology. The analysis by the consultancy Atkins for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said there was “a great deal of uncertainty with regards to the economics” of the smaller reactors. However, the authors said such reactors should be able to cut costs more quickly than large ones because they could be built and put into service in less time. Advocates have argued that the reactors could be built in factories and achieve savings through their modular nature. While the report covers the technology being used by several of the international companies seeking government support, it does not apply to the design being pushed by businesses including Rolls-Royce. A government source said nuclear companies had told officials that the cost of the technology had come down since the report, which was finished in July last year but only published on Thursday. As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, ministers confirmed that SMR developers would receive £56m of public funding for research and development over three years. A further £86m was announced for work on nuclear fusion. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the backing would help the nuclear sector compete globally. Chris Lewis, infrastructure lead at the big four consultancy EY, said the government research showed there was a case for SMRs. “While the study recognises that the economics to build SMRs are challenging, measures can be taken to achieve greater cost reduction through the standardisation of technology, greater modularisation, and the ability to standardise design and repeat manufacturing,” he said. The government also defended Britain’s need for new nuclear power in the face of falling renewable costs. Richard Harrington, the energy minister, said the record low subsidies recently awarded to offshore windfarms emphasised the challenge for the French, Korean, Chinese and Japanese companies building the UK’s new generation of nuclear plants to be competitive on price. The minister argued that the lower cost of wind did not spell the end for new nuclear. “We are trying to avoid … this simplistic view – well, as some people say, oh well, with the way the price of offshore wind has gone down that means bye bye nuclear and bye bye everything else,” he told an industry conference in London. “We know this is not the case. That’s a very naive and very simplistic way of doing it.” Lord Hutton, the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, criticised “simplistic” comparisons of the guaranteed prices awarded to nuclear plants and windfarms. He also described wind and solar as “intermittent and unpredictable”. However, green groups and politicians accused the government of talking down renewables. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “Instead of downplaying the rapid advancement of UK renewables, the government should concentrate on the export opportunities for this UK success story.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, called the UK’s energy policy a mess. “Ministers are ploughing huge sums of money into supporting overpriced nuclear, while retaining a de facto ban on onshore wind and failing to give solar the support the sector needs,” she said. Ministers also announced that they would be looking in the new year at plans for a long-term underground nuclear waste dump. The government has been searching for several years to find a community willing to play host to a so-called geological disposal facility, but without success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/oct/24/zero-support-the-democratic-presidential-candidate-who-refuses-to-give-up","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-24T06:00:59Z","webTitle":"Zero support: the Democratic presidential candidate who refuses to give up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/24/zero-support-the-democratic-presidential-candidate-who-refuses-to-give-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/oct/24/zero-support-the-democratic-presidential-candidate-who-refuses-to-give-up","fields":{"headline":"Zero support: the Democratic presidential candidate who refuses to give up","bodyText":"Joe Sestak, three-star admiral, two-term congressman, and Democratic presidential candidate, strode into his campaign event in New Hampshire last Tuesday to something of an anticlimax. There was only one person there. “Hello,” Sestak said, shaking the hand of the lone attendee: a woman named Kath Allen. The rally had been billed as a discussion of government’s role in society, and was held in the downstairs room of a public library in Peterborough, south-east New Hampshire. It was an inauspicious start to the two days the Guardian spent with Sestak, 67, who is spending three weeks campaigning in New Hampshire – including walking 105 miles (169km) across the state – as he seeks to build momentum for his little-known campaign to take on Donald Trump in the race for the White House in 2020. But it was also an insight into the difficulty that even seemingly well-qualified candidates have in breaking through the noise of a densely populated Democratic field, and the money and effort spent on campaigning that runs under the radar. Sestak, 67, spent four years in the House of Representatives, representing a traditionally Republican Pennsylvania district, until 2010. He announced his run for the presidency on 23 June. Before this New Hampshire sojourn, he had spent three months in Iowa, holding 235 events, driving 17,000 miles (27,000km) and, according to his campaign, “shaking nearly 30,000 hands”. He started his ramble across New Hampshire on 13 October, and is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days. So far, all that effort has had little impact. The most recent polling shows Sestak has the support of 0% of Iowans and 0% of New Hampshirites. Both states vote in three and a half months. A Quinnipiac nationwide poll released on Monday also bore bad news. Of 1,195 registered voters, Sestak was the choice of … 0%. On the same day, Sestak met Allen in Peterborough, the 12 leading Democratic candidates were debating in Ohio on CNN. The audience was 8.3 million: disappointing for CNN, but priceless exposure to someone like Sestak. Yet, to his credit, Sestak persevered with his one-person crowd in Peterborough. He’d walked there, after all – seven miles, from Dublin. Sestak’s staff will pick him up and drive him to some of his farther-flung New Hampshire events, but he plonks a stick in the ground at the end of each walk, and starts there again the next day. That same persistence was eventually rewarded at his Peterborough event, when, after speaking to Kath Allen and three journalists for half an hour, a second person showed up. And after listening to Sestak, Allen was impressed. He had answered her questions about senior care, and healthcare – he prefers the centrist Medicare-for-all-who-want-it-style plan, rather than the more progressive, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposal of Medicare for All. He had confidently fielded queries from the latecomer, about nuclear power. (He is in favor, but wants to use thorium reactors, not uranium.) But Allen wasn’t planning to vote for him, and she was skeptical about whether he will be the Democratic nominee. “I don’t think he can get it,” Allen said. “People want the flamboyant. And he’s not well-known.” “I like other candidates, I like Tulsi, I like Joe. I really like what Joe has to say on most of the things,” Allen said. “But I don’t know. I’m gonna see how this plays out.” By the time Sestak entered the race, most of the other candidates had been running for months. (John Delaney, a businessman and three-term congressman, had been running for almost two years.) Sestak announced his candidacy late because he was caring for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time. Happily, she is now in recovery, but his late entry means other candidates have pulled ahead. It goes without saying that his rivals have drawn larger crowds. Some 15,000 people attended an Elizabeth Warren rally in Seattle in August, and her campaign said 20,000 came out to an event in New York City in September. As the 12 leading candidates prepped to go onstage, Sestak attended his third event of the day: a local Democratic party meeting in Goffstown, 40 minutes north-east of Peterborough. It was 6.30pm before Sestak arrived and started speaking – 10 people had shown up – and he had another event in Windham, 35 minutes away, at 7.30pm. He promised to keep it short, and started with a joke. “I’m actually in the debate tonight,” Sestak told the crowd. “Congratulations!” someone said. They sounded surprised. “Online,” Sestak said. “We’re doing a live stream, in a Dunkin’ Donuts.” Sestak had used the same gag at the Peterborough library, where Allen had been halfway out of her chair going for a high five before he dropped the punchline. As promised, that night Sestak held his own online debate. He answered the same questions posed to the candidates on stage, live from a Dunkin’. Sestak was sitting quite far away from the camera and it was difficult to hear him. At 9.57pm, just three people were watching the live stream on Sestak’s Facebook page, and the Guardian was one of them. Part of Sestak’s problem may be that he is a centrist, white, older man, in a field with plenty of centrist, white, older men. Sestak’s USP, though, is his foreign policy experience and, given the chance, he ties it well to other aspects of the presidency. Climate change, for example. Sestak tells voters the US could pass the Green New Deal – the sweeping progressive proposal to tackle the climate crisis and inequality through economic reform – but it won’t make a difference to rising temperatures, given 80% of emissions come from the rest of the world. “We need someone who can unite this country and convene the world,” Sestak says, promising to bring the country together in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidency. The Guardian met Sestak again the day after the debate, in Peterborough, where he had planted his stick on Tuesday. He had 18 miles (29km) to walk on Wednesday, and he expected to be on the road until 11pm. We set off walking east, uphill, at a fast pace, Sestak wearing black hiking boots. He walked across Pennsylvania in 2015, when he campaigned for the Senate – he lost in the primary – and believes the benefits outweigh any potential pain. “It seems to be catching a little bit,” he said of his campaign. As well as walking and meeting people, Sestak is running a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire. “We see people who are seeing our ads. It’s coming to a point of once you know I’m out here serving, trying to serve you, and they’re interested.” Sestak doesn’t regret entering the race late. But he agrees he missed out on early exposure. “Would my position have been enhanced if I had got in earlier? With the town halls happening, I think it would be a bit easier,” Sestak said. With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won’t book him for interviews – even on foreign policy, despite his experience. He raised almost $375,000 in the third quarter of 2019, a total that pales in comparison with the $25m Warren raked in, or even the $2.3m raised by Steve Bullock, the Montana governor running at a more Sestak-esque 0.2% in national polls, but not a bad start. That fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the Guardian he had no plans to drop out. “I wouldn’t go through this if I didn’t think we have a possibility of winning,” he said. He had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day – a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat’s choice in the race for the White House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jun/10/political-expediency-chernobyl-catastrophic-continues-today","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-10T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl is still horrifyingly relevant – the lessons have not been learned | Natalia Antonova","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/political-expediency-chernobyl-catastrophic-continues-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/political-expediency-chernobyl-catastrophic-continues-today","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl is still horrifyingly relevant – the lessons have not been learned","bodyText":"I was two years old and living in Kyiv when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster happened. In spite of my grandfather’s fairly high military rank, we weren’t the first to know. When we did find out, I was, like many other children, shipped off to St Petersburg with my mother. My father, who was an engineer and had visited Chernobyl during his student years, later recalled how empty and ghostly Kyiv became. I don’t remember my grandfather speaking about Chernobyl, but I can imagine what it must have felt like for him. He was a combat veteran of the century’s most terrifying war and had hoped that his family would live out their lives in peace — and then this absolute horror happened. It was a tragedy compounded further by official cruelty and incompetence, by secrecy and the state’s inability to tell the full dark tale of what happened to a vulnerable populace. To a Russian-speaking child, the word itself conjures up a dark fairytale: a real-life story – byl – rendered in black hues – chernaya – (though the etymology of the name has to do with a type of plant). This week I forced myself to watch the HBO mini series Chernobyl about those terrible events. Despite a rapturous reception of the programme, which was released in May, I had previously been very reluctant to take a look. It has been hard for Ukrainians and Russians to grapple with this legacy in art – perhaps it is telling that this series has been made by Americans and is performed in English (though a great film about the tragedy, Aleksandr Mindadze’s Innocent Saturday was made in 2011). When references to Chernobyl and memes emanating from the TV series came across my feed, I would feel a sense of panic. One of my parents’ closest friends was a doctor who rushed to save people in the wake of the disaster – she has been disabled as a result for decades, and had to fight to get compensation. My mother once spent time in a Kyiv hospital on the same floor as some of the surviving victims. “They were slowly dying down the hall,” she said, weeping, about that experience. After leaving the USSR, I did most of my growing up in North Carolina: “You’re lucky you don’t glow,” a friend’s father snapped at me once when I tried to tell him about the place that I am from – beautiful Ukraine. Of course that wasn’t the real reason why I was afraid to watch, as I found out after reading dozens of ecstatic reviews from Ukrainian and Russian writers, then gritted my teeth and turned it on. What I was afraid of, what hit me square in the chest, was that Chernobyl is familiar in more ways than one. I didn’t recognise only those intelligent, earnest Soviet men and women – dying because people more powerful than them needed them to die to protect their own standing – but I also recognised how the mind-numbing lies and the political expediency of the horror is not something we can safely put away into a box. We can’t say, “That’s what happened then, and sure, it was incredibly awful and sad, but it doesn’t apply to us.” Whether it’s the demagogue sitting in the White House, the people who engineered Brexit, or the chorus on the right and corporate interests telling us that the climate crisis is nothing but an alarmist hoax, there are people who do the expedient thing for their own ends all around us. Many are powerful enough to decide our collective fates. Today, I regularly encounter people who think that life in a communist paradise will help humanity solve its current predicaments. Some are mean and cruel, delighted by the prospect of purging all those they consider their enemies. Some are decent and kind, unable to comprehend the brutalities of life in the USSR and genuine in their belief that Vladimir Lenin, the man whose name the doomed nuclear plant carried, foresaw a beautiful utopia – or, as us Soviets once called it, an age of mercy. I want to urge such people, as well as the Trumpers, the Brexiteers and everyone else, to watch Chernobyl. To do so is to be reminded of the fact that life is precious, and the least we can do is honour each other truthfully as human beings in the time that is allotted to us. The great power of the Chernobyl series is that it digs much deeper than the catastrophe itself. It shows us that people everywhere, whether in their heroic or cowardly moments, are still bound by a common thread. It’s what makes the characters so recognisable, even if you never knew anything about a place called Soviet Ukraine. It’s what makes the story live on. • Natalia Antonova is a journalist and playwright.

But you can follow all the latest developments in Russia’s war against Ukraine at our new blog here: Moldova’s foreign minister Nicu Popescu has said his country is approaching a “breaking point” in its ability to shelter those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. The number of refugees staying in Moldova is around 100,000 but represents a 4% increase in the national population and would be equivalent in proportion to 2.5 million refugees arriving in the UK in a fortnight, the BBC reports. Popescu told the BBC that Moldova was “Ukraine’s most fragile neighbour” with fewer financial resources, and less resilience in security, health care and education. A full Russian assault on Ukraine’s third largest city of Odesa, 48km from Moldova’s border, would likely trigger an “overwhelming” influx of refugees and would be a “complete catastrophe for the humanitarian situation”. Refugees fleeing the war are seen boarding trains across Ukraine en route to neighbouring European countries. Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics” in Ukraine to break the country apart, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation on Saturday. Posting a video to his social media accounts late Saturday evening, Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s regions, including Kherson, which was captured by Russian forces, not to repeat the experience of Donetsk and Luhansk. Zelenskiy said: The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics. They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe.” City council members in Kherson, a southern city of 290,000, on Saturday rejected plans for a new pseudo-republic, Zelenskiy added. Meanwhile, the Russian military say they have installed a new mayor in the occupied south-eastern Ukrainian city Melitopol following the alleged abduction of mayor Ivan Fedorov on Friday afternoon. Quick snap from US president Joe Biden, who issued a stern reflection on Russian president Vladimir Putin’s objectives. Putin was counting on a divided NATO, a divided West and quite frankly, a divided America. But he got none of that,” Biden tweeted on Saturday afternoon. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said Russia may use chemical weapons following its invasion of Ukraine and that such a move would be a war crime. Reuters reports that Stoltenberg told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that the Kremlin was inventing false pretexts to justify the possible use of chemical weapons: In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories. Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime.” Stoltenberg added that although the Ukrainian people were resisting the Russian invasion with courage, the coming days are likely to bring even greater hardship. The town of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region of Ukraine has been particularly hard hit by Russian shelling. A local hospital was destroyed, forcing people to gather in the basement as pro-Russian separatist troops were seen standing guard nearby. The regional governor told Ukrainian TV “Volnovakha with its infrastructure as such no longer exists”. The Russian military has reportedly installed a new mayor in the occupied south-eastern Ukrainian city Melitopol following the alleged abduction of mayor Ivan Fedorov on Friday afternoon. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier said Fedorov had been kidnapped and detained by a group of 10 armed men from the Russian forces. The Ukrainian foreign ministry called Fedorov’s detention an “abduction” and a “war crime.” Melitopol’s newly installed mayor is believed to be Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the city council, according to a statement on the Zaporozhye regional administration website, as reported by Ukrainian media, CNN and the BBC. Danilchenko was reportedly introduced as the acting mayor on local TV where she made a televised statement saying her “main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal.” She claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilise “the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behaviour.” “I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” Danilchenko said. “I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens.” “This committee will be tasked with administrative responsibilities on the territory of Melitopol and the Melitopol region,” she added. Russia’s central bank will continue to keep the Moscow stock market closed to trading next week with the Moscow Exchange to remain closed from March 14 to 18, the central bank announced on Saturday. The foreign exchange market, money market and repo market will remain open on those days, the statement said. A decision on trading next week will be made in the coming days. Online auction site eBay has said that it is blocking all transactions involving Russian addresses due to “service interruptions by payment vendors and major shipping carriers.” A spokesperson told CNBC: We stand with Ukraine and are taking a number of steps to support the Ukrainian people and our sellers in the region. As a result of service interruptions by payment vendors and major shipping carriers, we have temporarily suspended all transactions involving Russian addresses and transactions involving Ukraine addresses may experience delays.” The company is taking a number of steps to support Ukrainians and sellers in the region, including waiving seller fees, protecting sellers from late shipment penalties and negative feedback and matching employee donations to organisations helping Ukraine. The e-commerce company has already removed all products related to Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing its policy against items that promote or glorify hatred or violence. The Ukrainian ministry of defence has just released its daily operational report as of 10pm Saturday, local time. According to military officials, an “uncertainty of the military leadership of the Russian federation in matters of strategic objectives” and fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces has hindered Russia’s operational goals. “Measures are being taken to restore combat capability and regroup troops. The enemy is trying to reconnoitre and clarify the positions of the armed forces of Ukraine and possible ways of attack,” the report reads. Officials also warn of a “high probability” of direct participation of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus against Ukraine as well as an increase in operation reserves from the airborne forces. “Military and civilian infrastructure continues to be destroyed,” while Russian forces continue attempts to storm the city of Mariupol. Here is what the UK Sunday papers are reporting about Ukraine, with the government’s offer of £350 a month for people to house Ukrainian refugees the most popular top line: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another national address, claiming Russian forces have neither the strength nor the spirit to conquer Ukraine. Posting a video to his social media accounts late Saturday evening, Zelenskiy pleaded for more aid while noting humanitarian corridors in Ukraine have been working with 12,729 people evacuated on Saturday. The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible. I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe. The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going. All of the humanitarian corridors, by the way, which were agreed to – they have worked,” he said, adding “and then there will be humanitarian aid to Mariupol [but] because of difficulties, they had to stop in Gdansk.” The seven women and children who Ukraine said were killed when Russian forces attacked a convoy escaping a village in the Kyiv region on Saturday were not as previously stated in an agreed evacuation corridor, the defence ministry said in a statement about midnight. Ukraine’s intelligence service initially said Russia fired at a convoy of civilian evacuees who had been in a “green corridor” agreed with Russia from the village of Peremoha. A defence ministry statement later said people had in fact tried to escape by themselves, “so they began evacuating without the ‘green corridor’ agreed by the parties”. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met Russian President Vladimir Putin for several hours on Thursday evening in a bid to end the war in Ukraine, Germany’s Bild am Sonntag (BamS) reported, although it was unclear what was achieved. Citing a person with detailed insight into Schroeder’s activities, the newspaper said Schroeder had also had a long talk with one of Putin’s closest advisers. He left Moscow early on Saturday morning with his wife and flew to Istanbul, the paper said, without disclosing any further details of the conversations. The former chancellor, who is a personal friend of Putin and has links to Russian companies, had met a group of Ukrainians with links to the country’s delegation for peace talks with Russia in Turkey on Monday evening, reported BamS. The source told BamS that Schroeder was currently the only person to have had direct contact with both Putin and top Ukrainian officials. Politico reported the meeting had not been agreed to with German government sources. Chancellor Olaf Scholz declined to comment on the meeting beyond saying that he would take note of any results and include them in other efforts he was involved in. Schroeder, Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor from 1998 to 2005, is on the board of Russian oil giant Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholders’ committee of the company in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been shelved. He has faced calls from some German government politicians to step down from his roles over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Brits who open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion will get £350 a month under a “cash for accommodation” scheme, as ministers try to make amends for the UK’s chaotic response to the crisis. In a humiliation for Priti Patel, the home secretary, who has been heavily criticised for failing to remove bureaucratic visa requirements for refugees that have been waived by other European countries, fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove announced the plan last night, calling for a “national effort” on behalf of people in desperate need. Gove, secretary for levelling up, housing and communities said: “The crisis in Ukraine has sent shock waves across the world as hundreds of thousands of innocent people have been forced to flee their homes, leaving everything they know and love.” Under the scheme Ukrainians who are matched and housed with a UK “sponsor” will be granted leave to remain for three years. They will be able to work, claim benefits and access public services in that time. It’s 2am in Ukraine now. New satellite imagery of Mariupol is showing the widespread damage suffered since Russian forces surrounded the city 12 days ago. More than 1,500 civilians have been killed, and humanitarian aid groups say those remaining have not had access to water or medications in days. The constant shelling of the city has made it difficult to evacuate civilians and bring in supplies. The rate of refugees crossing the Ukrainian border has slowed, but Ukraine’s neighboring countries are still struggling to provide shelter for the estimated 2.6 million who have fled since the Russians invaded last month. About 13,000 refugees were evacuated through humanitarian corridors today. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke to Russian president Vladimir Putin by phone on Saturday and urged him to order an immediate ceasefire. But a French official said: “We did not detect a willingness on Putin’s part to end the war”. Ukrainian officials informed the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, that Russia was planning to take “full and permanent” control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant – an allegation that Russia denies. The Russian army has suffered its biggest losses in decades, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He said 31 Russian battalion tactical groups have now been rendered incapable of combat. At least 79 children have been killed and more than 100 have been injured so far in the war, according to Ukrainian officials. Seven civilians have died after coming under Russian fire while trying to flee fighting near Kyiv. Ukraine initially accused Russia of firing at a convoy of civilian evacuees from the village of Peremoha while they were in a designated humnitarian corridor, but later said it was not such a route. People have taken to the streets of cities all over the world to protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including in Berlin, Warsaw, London, New York and Los Angeles. US president Joe Biden has authorised $200m in weapons and other assistance for Ukraine, the White House has said. That’s all from me. I’ll be turning over coverage to my colleague, Samantha Lock. Thank you for reading. The Maxar Technologies satellite photos of Mariupol, released today, shows just some of the devastation wrought by Russian forces since they surrounded the southern Ukraine port city 12 days ago. More than 1,500 civilians have died. Humanitarian aid groups on the ground are reporting that the residents remaining have no access to running water or medications. Across the US, protesters gathered at “Close the Sky” rallies to call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. While the rate of refugees streaming over the Ukrainian border has slowed as of today, Ukraine’s neighboring countries are still struggling to provide shelter for the estimated 2.6 million refugees, Reuters is reporting. Hungary has received over 230,000 refugees, with 10,530 arriving on Friday. Romania reported 380,866, including 16,348 on Friday. Slovakia said it had 185,660 arrivals, with most continuing their journey further west, often to the Czech Republic, where officials on Friday estimated the number of refugees at 200,000. Two-thirds of those fleeing have gone to Poland, an estimated 1.3 million - Poland’s border guard said 76,200 people arrived on Friday, which was actually a 12% drop from the day before. Ukraine officials informed the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, that Russia was planning to take “full and permanent” control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant – an allegation that Russia denied. Russian forces seized control of the plant – the largest of its kind in Europe – last week after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors and drew condemnation from a number of world leaders as being reckless and irresponsible. Since then, about 400 Russian soldiers were “being present full time on site” and the plant remains under the control of the Russian military forces’ commander, as Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, wrote in a letter to the UN. Efforts to repair damaged power lines at the Chernobyl nuclear plant were also ongoing. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke to Naftali Bennett, the Israeli prime minister, about receiving assistance in securing the release of Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who was taken captive by Russian forces on Friday. At least 79 children have been killed and more than 100 injured in the Russian war on Ukraine: In addition to death and injury, in the chaos of trying to escape the bloodshed, children are going missing at the Ukrainian border, with humanitarian aid groups reporting instances of human trafficking. Read more here: Reuters is reporting that about 13,000 Ukrainians were able to be evacuated through humanitarian corridors today. However, out of the besieged port city of Mariupol, where at least 1,582 civilians have already been killed, the convoy failed to leave. The regional governor of Donetsk has said that the constant shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of 430,000 people has complicated getting aid and supplies through to those who need it, as well as complicated the ability to get people out safely. “They are bombing it (Mariupol) 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said during a video address. Russian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach Mariupol and blocked another, a Ukrainian official told the Associated Press. Russian forces have had Mariupol surrounded for at least 12 days, and Ukraine’s military said today that Russians forces had captured the city’s eastern outskirts, tightening their hold on the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports along the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. But as of today, Mariupol remained in Ukrainian control. While Ukrainians continue to defend their homeland on the ground, elsewhere around the world, others are putting pressure on their governments to punish the Russian government through other means besides warfare. In London, protesters took aim at Polina Kovaleva, the 26-year-old stepdaughter of Sergei Lavrov, the Russian minister of foreign affairs. They are calling for Kovaleva and the rest of Lavrov’s family to be sanctioned and ejected from the United Kingdom, under an unexplained wealth order order – under British law, a “politically exposed person” must explain the origin of assets that “appear to be disproportionate to their known lawfully obtained income”. Croatian officials criticized Nato today for what they described as a slow reaction to a military drone crashing into a field near a student dormitory in the Croatian capital, the Associated Press is reporting. The Soviet-era Tu-141 “Strizh” reconnaissance drone apparently flew from the Ukrainian war zone through the airspace of three Nato member states – Romania, Hungary and Croatia – before coming down in the capital city of Zagreb, damaging about 40 parked cars. No one was hurt. Both Russia and Ukraine have denied launching the drone, but military experts say Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141. Nato, which exists in part to help protect and alert its member states from surprise occurrences such as this, said the alliance’s integrated air and missile defense had tracked the drone’s flight path. But Andrej Plenković, Croatian prime minister, said Nato reacted only after questions were posed by journalists. “We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,” Plenković said while visiting the crash site. “This was a pure and clear threat and both Nato and the EU should have reacted,” he said. “We will work to raise the readiness not only of us but of others as well. “ Reuters is reporting that new satellite imagery from today revealed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure and buildings throughout the city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine. Russian forces had surrounded Mariupol more than a week ago, and have been shelling it steadily ever since. Today, Russian forces shelled a mosque that had been sheltering 80 adults and children, as well as Turkish citizens. Footage posted on Twitter today also showed a Russian tank firing at apartment buildings. At least 1,582 civilians have been killed in Mariupol. Despite the constant attacks, Mariupol is still under Ukrainian control. While 2.5 million Ukrainians have now fled their homeland and become refugees, the state border guard service is reporting that hundreds of thousands are returning as well – many to fight for their country. All around Europe today, demonstrators protested the Russian invasion of Ukraine and gathered in solidarity with Ukrainians. The Russian defense ministry said that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is continuing to decline rapidly, Reuters is reporting. Amid accusations today that Russian troops shot civilian evacuees, including children, the Russian defense ministry is also saying that Ukraine is not opening up humanitarian corridors to Russia. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that the Security Service of Ukraine has intercepted phone calls that prove that Russian troops near Kharkiv were ordered to shoot at civilians, including children. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights has documented, as of Tuesday, at least 170 people killed in the Kharkiv region – including five children. Hey there, Vivian Ho here, taking over our rolling coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: vivian.ho@guardian.co.uk. It is 8.30pm in Ukraine now. The Associated Press is reporting that about 6,500 Russian tourists are stranded in Thailand’s beach resorts because of the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. With many of their assets frozen because of sanctions and their flights canceled by airlines that have stopped flying to Russia, many have no way of getting home. A select few, according to Yuthasak Supasorn, the governor of the tourism authority of Thailand, are also choosing to delay their return. In addition to the 6,500 Russians stuck in Thailand, there are 1,000 Ukrainians who are unable to return to their homeland because it is under attack. The Ukrainian intelligence service says seven civilians have died after Russian troops fired at an evacuation convoy in the Kyiv region. Ukraine accused Russia of firing at a convoy of civilian evacuees from the village of Peremoha. US president Joe Biden has authorised $200m in weapons and other assistance for Ukraine, the White House has said. In a memorandum to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, Biden directed that the funds be allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act and designated for Ukraine’s defence. The Ukrainian foreign minister said Russia is using similar tactics in Ukraine to what it did in Syria and that Mariupol is besieged but still under Ukrainian control. Dmytro Kuleba also said that Russia tried to make a logistics base near Chernobyl. The US has said it is willing to take diplomatic steps to help the Ukrainian government. A state department spokesperson made the comments on Saturday after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the west should be more involved in negotiations to end the war. That’s it from me for today. Handing over now to my colleague Vivian Ho. Thanks for reading. Russia will have to seek alternative sources to reinforce their “overstretched regular forces”, the UK’s ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence update. The MoD tweeted: President Putin has publicly welcomed the recruitment of ‘16,000 mostly Middle Eastern volunteers’ to support his invasion of Ukraine. Syrian mercenaries have deployed alongside Russian proxy forces in Libya since late 2020. This follows earlier reporting that Russia was also planning to deploy experienced mercenaries from Russian Private Military Companies to support the invasion. Russia this week has also been forced to acknowledge the use of conscript soldiers in its operations against Ukraine. As losses mount, Russia will be forced to draw on alternative sources to reinforce their overstretched regular forces. The regional governor of Donetsk has said that constant shelling is complicating bringing aid into Mariupol, reports Reuters. The Ukrainian intelligence service says seven civilians have died after Russian troops fired at an evacuation convoy in the Kyiv region. Ukraine accused Russia of firing at a convoy of civilian evacuees from the village of Peremoha, reports Reuters. “After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village,” the intelligence service said in a statement. Russia has denied targeting civilians since the start of the invasion on 24 February. Thousands of people filled one of Florence’s biggest squares today to show their support for Ukraine. Residents of Florence, which is the twin city of Kyiv, watched a speech by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and waved blue and yellow flags in Piazza Santa Croce as church bells tolled 17 times – once for each day since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Russians are under a dictatorship and cannot understand why they came to destroy our cities and kill our children,” Lesia Mykhailenko, who was born in Donetsk and now works for a law firm in Florence, told Reuters. “I cannot hate them because our bonds have lasted for centuries,” she added. In his speech, which was broadcast to dozens of European cities as part of Cities Stand with Ukraine, Zelenskiy said that 79 children had been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. He also called for more sanctions against Moscow and a no-fly zone. Residents in Kyiv awoke to the sound of air raid sirens in the early hours of this morning which were followed by gunfire and explosions. Sirens also reportedly sounded in Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Cherkasy and Sumy. Thousands of people protested in the Ukrainian city of Melitopol earlier today after the alleged arrest of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by Russian forces. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of violating international law by abducting the mayor after he was falsely accused of terrorism. Here is video footage of the protest, provided by the deputy head for the president’s office in Ukraine: US president Joe Biden has authorised $200m in weapons and other assistance for Ukraine, the White House has said. In a memorandum to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, Biden directed that the funds be allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act and designated for Ukraine’s defence, reports Reuters. The new funds can be used for weapons, defence articles from the stock of the defence department and military education and training. It comes after the US Congress approved $13.6bn in emergency aid for Ukraine. The Ukrainian foreign minister said Russia is using similar tactics in Ukraine to what it did in Syria and that Mariupol is besieged but still under Ukrainian control, reports Reuters. Dmytro Kuleba also said that Russia tried to make a logistics base near Chernobyl. He said that although Russia and Ukraine are talking and that they remain open to diplomacy, Russia is still putting forward demands that are unacceptable. Ukraine is ready to negotiate but will not surrender, he said. Kuleba said Ukraine needs help to investigate and prosecute possible war crimes and that more needs to be done to hit the Russian economy. If they had more planes, he said more civilian lives would have been saved. He said he believes that Belarus is not willing to send troops to Ukraine – despite being under pressure from Russia. The US has said it is willing to take diplomatic steps to help the Ukrainian government, reports Reuters. A state department spokesperson made the comments on Saturday after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the west should be more involved in negotiations to end the war. “If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian government believes would be helpful, we’re prepared to take them,” the spokesperson said. “We are working to put the Ukrainians in the strongest possible negotiating position, including by increasing pressure on Russia by imposing severe costs and by providing security assistance to help Ukrainians defend themselves.” Hi, I’m looking after the blog for the next couple of hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk It’s 6pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand now: Russian forces are advancing towards Kyiv, with the bulk of ground forces now about 25km from the centre of the capital, according to the UK’s latest defence intelligence report. Air raid sirens were sounding in Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday morning. Russian forces bombarded cities across the country on Friday and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault. Two oil depots near Kyiv caught on fire after Russian attacks, one in the town of Vasylkiv which is also home to a large airbase and has become a major Russian target, local media reported. More than 2,000 people took part in a protest outside the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol after the alleged arrest of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by Russian forces, Ukrainian state TV said. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of violating international law by abducting the mayor after he was falsely accused of terrorism. Belarus has denied plans to join the Russian invasion. The country’s armed forces’ chief of general staff, Viktor Gulevich, said Belarus had no plans to enter into the war but is sending five battalion tactical groups to its border with Ukraine on rotation to replace forces already there. The Russian army has suffered its biggest losses in decades, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy said 31 Russian battalion tactical groups have now been rendered incapable of combat and that 500 to 600 Russian troops surrendered on Friday. The Guardian cannot independently verify these figures. Speaking at a news briefing today, Zelenskiy insisted any negotiations with Russia must begin with a ceasefire, but that he was open to discussions with Putin. The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the possibility of negotiations being held in Jerusalem with the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. They echoed Zelenskiy’s call for a ceasefire as a condition for structured negotiations, but a French presidency official said Putin did not appear ready to end the war. Russian forces are reportedly planning to conduct a “pseudo referendum” in Kherson, the Ukrainian city under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the local council in Kherson told Reuters that it wants to create a new breakaway republic. Italian authorities seized a €530m (£444m) superyacht owned by Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko as part of EU sanctions. Sy A – short for Sailing Yacht A – was seized on Friday evening in the port of Trieste after being identified by Italian police as belonging to the billionaire owner of EuroChem Group, a major fertiliser producer, and the coal company SUEK. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today as I hand over the blog to my colleague Miranda Bryant. Goodbye for now. The eastern Ukrainian town of Volnovakha has been completely destroyed following the Russian invasion, Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said today, Reuters reports. Fighting continues for territory there to prevent a Russian encirclement, he said. From the Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko: A French presidency official said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, did not show a willingness to end a war with Ukraine during a call today with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Reuters reports. The French and German leaders reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine as a condition for full negotiations, the official said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, where he told reporters that Russia can only take the Ukrainian capital if it “razes the city to the ground”, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy said he was open to discussions with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, adding that he had discussed the possibility of negotiations being held in Jerusalem with the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. He said he hoped Bennett would have a “positive influence” on peace talks with Russia. Zelenskiy’s comments came after an unidentified Ukrainian government official said the Israeli PM had urged Zelenskiy to accept an offer made by Putin to end the war, as reported by Israel’s Walla news, the Jerusalem Post and US news site Axios. Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, denied the media report while a senior Israeli officer described it as “patently false”. At no point did Prime Minister Bennett advise President Zelenskiy to take a deal from Putin - because no such deal was offered to Israel for us to be able to do so. Bennett has at no point told Zelenskiy how to act, nor does he have any intention to. Footage appears to show the mayor of the south-eastern Ukraine city Melitopol being marched away by Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, had been kidnapped by a group of 10 armed men from Russian forces, who put a plastic bag over his head. Speaking at a news briefing, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said around 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the start of the Russian invasion. He also claimed that around 500-600 Russian troops surrendered to Ukrainian forces on Friday. The Guardian cannot independently verify these figures. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams had started discussing concrete topics rather than exchanging ultimatums. The west should be more involved in negotiations to end the war, he said. The European Union faces soaring energy prices in the wake of sanctions imposed against Russia over events in Ukraine, a Russian foreign ministry official said, Reuters reports. Russia was a reliable supplier of energy but was ready for a tough confrontation in the sector if necessary, Interfax quoted Nikolai Kobrinets as saying. He did not provide details of what that confrontation might entail. The EU could end up paying at least three times more for oil, gas and electricity, he said. I believe the European Union would not benefit from this - we have more durable supplies and stronger nerves. Russian forces may be deliberating attacking Ukrainian food supplies in their attacks, Channel 4 News’ Lindsey Hilsum says. Russian forces are reportedly planning to conduct a “pseudo referendum” in Kherson, the Ukrainian city under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the local council in Kherson told Reuters that it wants to create a new breakaway republic. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine in a call with Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Reuters reports. According to a German government spokesperson: The conversation is part of ongoing international efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The spokesperson said the participants agreed to say nothing further about the substance of the phone call. Scholz had earlier spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about the situation, they added. During the call, Putin briefed them on talks between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin told the news agency. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that any negotiations with Russia will have to begin with a ceasefire as he accused the west of insufficient involvement in peace talks. He said Russian and Ukrainian negotiating teams have started talking about concrete topics as opposed to exchanging ultimatums, reports Reuters. He also said some small Ukrainian towns have ceased to exist as a result of the war. He said he does not see bravery from Nato on Ukraine and doesn’t see common consensus to accept the country joining the alliance. British people who want to host Ukrainian refugees in their home under a new government scheme will have to do so for a minimum of six months, reports the Times. At the moment Britain’s visa scheme for Ukrainian refugees is limited to those with family members already settled in the UK. But under another plan, expected to be launched on Monday, individuals and companies will be permitted to sponsor Ukrainians with no ties to the UK. However, the Times reports that hosts taking part in the scheme will have to commit to a minimum of six months. A government source told the newspaper: It’s about making sure we have secure offers. Unfortunately it’s going to need to be a long-term scheme as it doesn’t look like they’ll be going home any time soon. More details of the SY A superyacht sezied by Italian authorities last night: Italian authorities have seized a €530m (£444m) superyacht owned by Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko as part of EU sanctions following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Sy A – short for Sailing Yacht A – was seized on Friday evening in the port of Trieste after being identified by Italian police as belonging to billionaire owner of EuroChem Group, a major fertiliser producer, and the coal company SUEK. Video footage reportedly showed police cars with flashing lights approaching the yacht, said to be one of the largest in the world, and boarding it. EuroChem and SUEK said in statements on Thursday that Melnichenko had resigned as a member of the board in both companies and withdrawn as their beneficiary, effective on Wednesday. It comes as Roman Abramovich’s superyacht, Solaris, was pictured arriving in Tivat, Montenegro, on Saturday. The vessel left a port in Barcelona earlier this week as the UK government sanctioned the Russian billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club. On Thursday it was tracked off the coast of Sicily after reportedly undergoing repairs earlier in the week in Barcelona, one of a number of apparently hurried sailings of Russian billionaires moving their superyachts to avoid seizure. His other yacht, the more luxurious Eclipse, was on Thursday located to the west of the Canary Islands. A senior Russian diplomat has warned that from now on Moscow will consider arms shipments to Ukraine as “legitimate targets”. The comments by the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, reported by Sky News and BuzzFeed News, are likely to raise fears over a potential escalation in the conflict in Ukraine. Ryabkov said that Russia had made its position clear to the US. He said that Russia “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. Denouncing US sanctions against Moscow, he said they were an “unprecedented attempt to deal a serious blow to various sectors of the Russian economy”. But he insisted that Russia did not intend to expel western media and businesses, adding: “We aren’t going to escalate the situation.” Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League board. The decision comes after Abramovich was hit by UK government sanctions on Thursday, in turn imposing severe operational restrictions on Chelsea. A Premier League statement reads: Following the imposition of sanctions by the UK government, the Premier League board has disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club. The board’s decision does not impact on the club’s ability to train and play its fixtures, as set out under the terms of a licence issued by the government, which expires on 31 May 2022. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called on the leaders of France and Germany to help secure the release of Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who Kyiv says was abducted by Russian forces, AFP reports. Zelenksiy was speaking in his latest video address, where he said 2,000 Ukrainians demonstrated in Melitopol on Saturday against the Russian invasion and to demand the release of their mayor. Do you hear, Moscow? If 2,000 people demonstrate in Melitopol against the occupation, how many are there in Moscow against the war? He said: During the night and today we are talking to our partners about the situation with our mayor. Our demand is clear: he must be released immediately... I have already phoned (German) Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I have spoken to (French) President Emmanuel Macron... I will speak to all the necessary people to get our people released. We expect world leaders to show us how they can influence the situation. Evacuations of civilians from frontline towns in Ukraine’s Kyiv region were proceeding, Reuters cites regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba as saying. Speaking to local media, Kuleba said evacuations are planned to continue into tomorrow. We will try to get people out every day, as long as it’s possible to observe a ceasefire. The leaders of France and Germany have started another round of phone talks with Vladimir Putin. The French presidency said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, have started a call with Putin over the war in Ukraine. Macron had said at a European Union summit on Friday that he and Scholz would hold a fresh call with Putin in the coming hours after a previous three-way exchange on Thursday. In his latest video address to the nation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed 31 Russian battalion tactical groups have now been rendered incapable of combat. The Russian troops are suffering great losses. We could even now talk about the greatest blow to the Russian troops in tens of years. Zelenskiy urged Russia to uphold an agreed ceasefire to allow evacuations to proceed from the besieged port city of Mariupol, after blaming Moscow for the failure of previous attempts He went on to demand the immediate release of Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who Ukraine says was kidnapped by Russian forces. Zelenskiy said he was in constant talks with Ukraine’s international partners about the situation with Melitpol’s mayor. We appeal to all world leaders who speak to Moscow – France, Germany, Israel, and others. The bombings are hundreds of kilometres away from here, in Lviv, and yet the war is still visible in all of its tragic proportions, Lorenzo Tondo reports. At least 200,000 internally displaced people are currently living in Lviv, stretching the capacity of this amazing Unesco world heritage site to its limits. Lviv’s deputy mayor said: We’re using all our facilities to shelter them. We will not let our people down. At the same time, our resources are not infinite and we are close to reaching the limit. As the Russian bombardments in the east intensified, thousands more displaced have been flowing into Lviv, widely regarded, at least up to now, as one of the safest cities in the country. Belarusian armed forces’ chief of general staff, Viktor Gulevich, said Belarus has no plans to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine but is sending five battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to its border on rotation to replace forces already stationed there. On Friday, a top Ukrainian security official warned Belarus not to send troops to Ukraine amid fears that Belarus was planning to join Russian armed forces within hours. Gulevich denied plans to invade Ukraine today: I want to underline that the transfer of troops is in no way connected with (any) preparation, and especially not with the participation of Belarusian soldiers in the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian troops, missiles and aircraft, but it has not deployed its own forces in active battle. Ukraine yesterday accused Russian aircraft of firing at Belarusian border villages from Ukrainian air space to provide an excuse for an offensive. The alleged attacks took place as the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, was meeting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, according to Ukraine’s state centre for strategic communications. BBC News’ Orla Guerin travelled to the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to shed light on the devastating emotional impact on soldiers, older people and fleeing families from the frontline. Russian attacks continue in areas where Ukraine is trying to evacuate people and bring aid through “humanitarian corridors”, the governors of two Ukrainian regions, Kyiv and Donetsk, said in separate statements, Reuters reports. The Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, told local media: Humanitarian cargo is moving towards Mariupol, we will inform you how it develops ... The situation is complicated, there is constant shelling. Children are going missing and cases of human trafficking are being reported by aid groups and volunteers along Ukraine’s borders amid the chaos of the refugee crisis triggered by the Russian invasion, Katy Fallon reports. Charities and rights groups working in neighbouring countries to receive refugees said they had seen cases of trafficking, missing children, extortion and exploitation as more than 2.5 million people crossed into neighbouring countries to escape the escalating violence. Karolina Wierzbińska, a coordinator from Homo Faber, a human rights organisation based in Lublin, Poland, said the charity had seen cases of children being sent alone by desperate parents to meet relatives or friends across the Ukrainian border and arriving without anyone to meet them. This is obviously extremely distressing for a child and can lead to them wandering around the station alone, disoriented and in the worst-case scenario, disappearing altogether. This, unfortunately, is not a hypothetical case – it has happened already. We are also already getting reports of cases of human trafficking and women being offered work in Poland only to find the workplace is illegitimate, the employer is mistreating them, refusing to pay their salary on time. There are cases of extortion of personal documents or money. Homo Faber has been working at all four border crossing points to mitigate the risks and has set up a 24-hour helpline, operated by Ukrainian speaking volunteers trained to support women and children crossing the border. Russian forces have shelled a mosque in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, where more than 80 adults and children, including Turkish citizens, have taken refuge, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. The ministry claimed the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent mosque in Mariupol had been shelled by Russian “invaders”. It did not provide details about casualties. Moscow has denied targeting civilian areas. A former Nato official said she is “sceptical” Russian forces will gain “much success” in an assault on Kyiv. A massive convoy of Russian forces massed outside the Ukrainian capital is believed to have dispersed, in preparation for an advance. This morning, the UK’s ministry of defence said “the bulk of Russian ground forces” were around 25km from the centre of Kyiv. But Rose Gottemoeller, a former deputy secretary general of Nato, told the BBC today that this could be taken as a sign of weakness. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme, Gottemoeller said: I’m wondering if they have the ability to regroup at this point, because their logistics are in such bad shape, they don’t really have the fuel supplies they need for a push on to Kyiv. More than 2,000 people took part in a protest outside the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol after the alleged arrest of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by Russian forces, Ukrainian state TV said. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of violating international law by abducting the mayor of Melitopol, a Ukrainian city that fell under Russia’s control during the invasion, after being falsely accused of terrorism. In a video message late on Friday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned the abduction, calling Fedorov a “mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community”. A new wave of Russian attacks is expected to hit the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Donbas regions, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff said. Speaking today, Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukraine did not expect Belarus to join the Russian invasion force. Where have Russian forces been seen around Kyiv? Sanctions against Russia could cause the International Space Station (ISS) to crash and lead to a 500-tonne structure to “fall down into the sea or onto land”, the head of Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said. Dmitry Rogozin, a vocal supporter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, called for sanctions to be lifted as they could disrupt the operation of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS. As a result, the Russian segment of the station - which helps correct its orbit - could be affected, causing the 500-tonne structure to “fall down into the sea or onto land”, the Roscosmos chief wrote on Telegram. Publishing a map of the locations where the ISS could possibly come down, he said it was unlikely to be in Russia. But the populations of other countries, especially those led by the ‘dogs of war’, should think about the price of the sanctions against Roscosmos. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has previously said it was trying to find a solution to keep the ISS in orbit without Russia’s help. A frozen goods warehouse caught fire due to Russian shelling in Brovary district, north-east of Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s interior ministry. The shelling took place in the village of Kvitneve about 5.30am local time (3.30am GMT), the ministry said. Preliminary reports show there were no casualties. Earlier we reported that two oil depots near Kyiv had also caught fire after Russian attacks. Ukrainian officials have said Kyiv is “ready to fight” as Russian forces renewed their bombardment on the capital and observers warned of “an unimaginable tragedy” unfolding after more than two weeks of war, Tess McClure, Peter Beaumont and Luke Harding report. Air raid sirens and shelling rang out over Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning amid warnings from western defence officials that the Russians were beginning to gain ground around the capital. There were reports of loud explosions in Dnipro in the country’s east on Saturday, as well as Mykolaiv, Nikolaev and Kropyvnytskyi. But Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the capital was “ready to fight”. He called it a “city under siege”, with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place. Kyiv will stand until the end. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies on Saturday has shown homes and buildings on fire and Russian artillery battalions appearing to fire on towns surrounding to the north-west of the Ukrainian capital as forces advance. The Guardian has not independently verified the images. A senior US defence official said at a Pentagon briefing on Friday: “We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east.” The UK Ministry of Defence said on Saturday morning that “the bulk of Russian ground forces” were around 25km from the centre of Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and continued to suffer heavy Russian shelling. Several humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, including from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, will be open today for civilians to evacuate, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. In a video address, Vereshchuk said Ukraine plans to evacuate residents of several towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv and Sumy and some other areas where there is ongoing combat. It follows repeated failed attempts this week to allow a humanitarian convoy to reach Mariupol, where civilians remain trapped without power or mobile phone network, and water and food are running out. Vereshchuk said today: I hope that the day will go well, all the planned routes will be open and Russia will fulfil its obligations to guarantee the ceasefire regime. At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said in an online statement on Friday. The Guardian has not been able to verify casualty figures. In the embattled northeastern city of Sumy, regional head Dmitry Zhyvytsky said in a post on Telegram that humanitarian corridors have been agreed on Saturday morning. Evacuation efforts starting at 9am local time (7am GMT) will see vehicles departing from six destinations around the region to the central city of Poltava, he said. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong here to take you through the day’s rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. As always, please feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag. You can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian troops have destroyed 3,491 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities in Ukraine so far, Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Saturday, according to Reuters. Russian forces “continue the offensive in Ukraine on a broad front”, Konashenkov said. Reuters was not immediately able to verify his statement. In the week since the Kremlin blocked Facebook, hundreds of thousands of Russians have sought to circumvent the ban using a virtual private network, the Guardian’s global technology editor Dan Milmo reports. A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your device and a remote server, which can be anywhere in the world, so in theory you can access sites blocked in your country. Nikolay*, a Russian who now lives in the EU, says his friends back home bought a VPN in order to communicate with him and others amid fears that access to the outside world could become limited. “There is a lot of talk that people should get these VPNs as soon as possible,” says Nikolay. Over the past week VPNs have been in strong demand in Russia. Internet searches for VPN services in the country almost doubled between 4 March and 10 March compared with the previous week, according to Top10VPN, a UK company that reviews and recommends private network services. There were at least 260,000 searches on 5 March alone, the day after Facebook was banned. “By replacing their Russian IP address with that of the remote server, which will typically be in another country, using a VPN means Russians can access internet services that are blocking Russian traffic,” says Simon Migliano, head of research at Top10VPN. Read more here: In case you missed it earlier, a huge yacht belonging to the Russian oligarch, Andrey Melnichenko, has reportedly been seized by Italian authorities, according to CNN, citing a statement from Italy’s finance police. The seizure was also reported by the Italian news outlet Tg La7. A statement by the Guardia di Finanza said the vessel — called SY A — was worth about €530m euros ($578m) and was in storage at the northeastern port of Trieste. Melnichenko made his fortune in coal and fertiliser. The SY A, which stands for “sailing yacht A”, is believed to be one of the largest superyachts in the world. It follows the seizure last week of a yacht owned by Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, in the wake of western sanctions against Russian oligarchs regarded as close to Vladimir Putin. Ukraine will soon be getting a new postage stamp called “Russian warship, go fuck yourself!” according to the country’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar. The stamp, which refers to the infamous Snake Island incident, features a sketch by the artist Boris Groh and received the most votes in a poll, she said. Thirteen border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, reportedly told a Russian warship, “Russian warship go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender early in the conflict and were then killed. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy then announced he would posthumously award all the soldiers the Hero of Ukraine award although it was later reported that they may in fact still be alive. Local media in Ukraine report that two oil depots near Kyiv are on fire after Russian attacks. One depot was hit in the town of Vasylkiv, 36 kilometres south of the capital, and another was hit in the village of Kryachky, according to the Kyiv Independent. Vasylkiv is also home to a large airbase and has become a major Russian target. After an initial honeymoon period with the west, Russian president Vladimir Putin later soured on it. He has clawed back Russian relevance by tearing up global norms, writes the Guardian’s world affairs editor Julian Borger. When the first McDonald’s in Moscow opened 32 years ago, the line of Russians waiting outside was hundreds of metres long, and there were long queues again this week for a last Happy Meal and a slice of history, as the fast-food giant closes its doors in Russia. The shuttering of 850 McDonald’s franchises around the country is supposed to be temporary, but nothing about the war in Ukraine and the consequent exodus of western companies suggests the rift will be healed any time soon. McDonald’s’ departure, like its arrival, is about a lot more than burgers. The golden arches of history, that once seemed to be bounding forward, now appear to be turning full circle and threatening to take Russia back in time. An urban consumer culture built around Visa and Mastercard, Ikea, Nike, Apple, Zara and Netflix has evaporated in a few days. “There’s just this sickening feeling that they’re going to go back, not to the 1990s, but to the 1970s when you didn’t have access to these things, and when you were living isolated from the rest of the world,” said Prof Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia on the National Intelligence Council, now at Georgetown University. The looped trajectory of the past three decades has been driven by a lot of disparate forces, inside and outside Russia, economic and political, and ultimately very personal: the ambitions, fears and impulses of Vladimir Putin. When the first McDonald’s opened in Russia, the Soviet Union still existed. “We didn’t know what fast food was,” wrote Mitya Kushelevich, a photographer, in a recollection in the Guardian. “We thought it probably tasted like freedom and we wanted to sample it.” To many people, it tasted like the end of the cold war, if not the end of history. But while Russians wanted to consume capitalism, they were careful from the start not to be consumed by it. “People misunderstood: Russians didn’t want to be Americans, and they didn’t want to be like America, but they wanted the same stuff: the jeans, the cigarettes, the chewing gum, the burgers,” said Fiona Hill, who was an exchange student in Russia in the late 1980s and went on to become an intelligence analyst on Russia and then senior director for Europe and Russia in the White House. Nautilus Pompilius, a Russian rock group, had a hit song at the time called Goodbye America, with lyrics that reflected that scepticism, about being “taught for so long to love your forbidden fruits” but finding that “your ripped jeans have become too small for me”. The honeymoon with westernisation was short-lived. The shock transition from communism to a market economy, shepherded by a liberal government with western consultants, was a disaster, producing oligarchs, lawlessness and poverty. Read on here: Fighting north-west of Kyiv is continuing with the bulk of Russian ground forces now about 25 kilometres from the centre of the Ukrainian capital, according to the UK’s latest Defence Intelligence report. “Elements of the large Russian column north of Kyiv have dispersed,” it continued. “This is likely to support a Russian attempt to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.” Elsewhere in Ukraine the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled and continued to suffer heavy Russian shelling, the report said. In an early morning update on Telegram, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services (SES) said rescuers in Kharkiv had recovered the bodies of five people including two children, who were killed when Russian bombs hit a residential building in the village of Slobozhanske, outside the city. It also said workers had visited 40 separate addresses to dispose of unexploded ordnance. In the capital Kyiv the SES said a fire had broken out at frozen food warehouse after shelling early on Saturday and posted images of a building with flames and smoke pouring out. No casualties were reported. It’s two weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s apparent plan to quickly seize key cities has failed. But there is little sign that anybody around Russian president Vladimir Putin might be able to stop the war, or that elites might remove him from power, writes Pjotr Sauer. Earlier this week, Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged that young conscripts had been sent into battle and some taken prisoner. The admission, notable in itself given Russia’s careful attempts to control the narrative about the war, came just a day after President Vladimir Putin assured his nation in a video address that conscripts “are not participating and will not participate” in the conflict. The backtracking prompted some to question whether the Russian leader lied in his statement or was simply provided inaccurate information. “This incident reveals some of the unrealistic expectations Putin had when starting this military operation,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “It looks likely that Putin genuinely thought Russia would be able to take Ukraine by storm and instructed his military not to use conscripts. But this is just one of the many aspects that have turned out differently in reality.” Two weeks into the war, it has become evident that the Russian army has failed in its initial plan to quickly seize major cities – including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv in north-eastern Ukraine. The attack on Odesa, a crucial port city in the south, has also stalled, and Russian land advances have been thwarted repeatedly. More than a week ago, Russia admitted that almost 500 of its soldiers had been killed, a figure that has not since been updated, while US officials estimate that between 5,000 and 6,000 Russian troops have died. “The current problems should be traced back to the inception of this war, which was conducted in high secrecy to avoid any leaks,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The Kremlin’s disastrous move to invade was rooted in giant lapses of expertise about Ukraine,” said Gabuev, who added that officials close to Putin who helped plan the invasion sincerely believed that many Ukrainians would welcome Russian soldiers, and that the country’s leadership would offer little resistance. “Only a very small group of generals were informed about the war, and they didn’t ask difficult questions that could help prepare for any scenarios other than a speedy Russian victory. “The whole war planning was reduced to a clandestine operation developed by just a handful of people in uniform – and the president himself,” said Gabuev. Read on here: Dnipro was one of the cities reported to be enduring Russian bombardment early Saturday, but the city’s mayor Borys Filatov says Ukraine’s air defence systems successfully repelled the attack with no casualties reported, according to the Kyiv Independent. The US economy is strong despite the threat of spillovers from sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and inflation, US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said on Friday. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise US interest rates next week to combat rising prices, Yellen also said that a tighter monetary policy to fight inflation could cause recession, but she had confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to balance that. It follows a turbulent week on financial markets as the western allies ramped up their sanctions against Russia, especially in oil and gas, bringing the threat of much higher fuel prices for already-stretched consumers. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 fell 2.9% for the week, and logged its second straight weekly decline. The Dow was down 0.69% on Friday but fell for a fifth straight week. Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index closed 1% up, making this the first weekly gain after three consecutive weeks of losses. The FTSE100 in London ended the week 2.4% higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 1.67% lower On Friday, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.05%. Brent crude oil settled up 3.05% at $112.67 a barrel, after touching a 14-year high of more than $139 on Monday. Russian ground forces attempting to encircle Kyiv began another pause on Friday to resupply and refit after “failed attacks” earlier in the week, according to an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank. “Russian forces also appear to be largely stalemated around Kharkiv,” it said. “Russian advances from Crimea toward Mykolayiv and Zaporizhya and in the east around Donetsk and Luhansk made no progress in the last 24 hours.” It noted that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly conducting an internal purge of general offers and intelligence personnel, including by firing several generals and arresting FSB intelligence officers. The ISW said the Kremlin was likely trying to “increase its combat power by drawing Belarus into the war and leveraging Syrian proxies, in addition to ongoing efforts to directly replace Russian combat losses through individual conscripts that are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated.” Russian aircraft had likely conducted an attempted false-flag attack on Belarusian territory on Friday in an effort to draw Belarus into the war but Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko was likely to be resisting that pressure in order to avoid western sanctions and combat losses, the institute said. Guatemala has received its first arrivals of Ukrainian families fleeing their homeland since Russia’s invasion of its neighbour last month, authorities said. The eight Ukrainians were the first to arrive in the Central American country “for humanitarian reasons,” an immigration spokesperson told Reuters. Another flight carrying 10 more Ukrainians is set to arrive later Friday evening, officials said. It is unclear how many may have arrived privately to Guatemala since the Russian attacks on Ukraine began. The Guatemalan government’s announcement was the first on Ukrainian arrivals from the trio of Central American countries known as the Northern Triangle, which have themselves seen much of their populations emigrate due to violence and poverty. A rising number of both Ukrainians and Russians have fled to Latin America in recent months, including those who turn up at the United States-Mexico border. After a day in which the G7 announced it would strip Russia of “most favoured nation” status under WTO rules and the US said it would ban imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, Joe Biden has said “Democracies are rising to meet this moment, rallying the world to the side of peace and security.” “The United States and our allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressure on Putin and to further isolate Russia on the global stage,” the US president tweeted. China, which has stood by Moscow even as Russia becomes increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, says its first batch of humanitarian assistance has arrived in the western Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi. A second batch is expected to depart from Beijing on Saturday and arrive in Ukraine on Monday, the state-backed Global Times reported. The shipbuilding city of Mykolaiv, seen as a key stepping stone for Russian troops on the way to the key port city of Odesa, has endured over a week of fighting, with many civilian casualties reported. Russian forces reportedly hit a cancer hospital on Friday. Here are a selection of images from photographers on the frontline: Hello, I’m Helen Livingstone and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here are some of the major developments in the past few hours: Satellite images show Russian forces are getting closer to Kyiv and appear to be firing artillery toward residential areas, Reuters has reported. Air raid sirens were sounding in Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday morning, and there were reports of heavy shelling. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country had reached a “strategic turning point” in the conflict as Russian forces appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on Kyiv. Hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped and under fire in Ukrainian cities, but the situation in Mariupol is especially dire. Ten days into Russia’s siege, its population has no access to electricity or mobile phone networks, and water and food are running out. Ukraine fears Belarus might launch an invasion of Ukraine on Saturday after a meeting in Moscow between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. Ukraine accused Russia of firing at a Belarusian settlement near the border in an attempt to drag Belarus into the war. EU leaders plan to collectively rearm and become autonomous in food, energy and military hardware in a declaration after their meeting at Versailles that described Russia’s war as “a tectonic shift in European history”. The UN security council met on Friday to discuss Moscow’s claims that the US is funding “military biological activities” in Ukraine.The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, invoked the terrifying spectre of an “uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine” across Europe. The US has warned of the possibility of chemical or biological weapons being used by Russia. Britain and the US have voiced fears Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine, and using its accusations of bio-labs as pretext. Russian airstrikes hit three cities in Ukraine on Friday – including two in the country’s west – as the scope of its military offensive widened. The raids hit airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, far from the main areas of conflict, and residential buildings in the strategically important city of Dnipro. A third Russian major general has been killed in Ukraine, western officials confirmed. Western intelligence estimates that about 20 major generals would have been committed to the invasion, implying a relatively high casualty rate. Ukraine accused Russia of violating international law today by abducting the mayor of Melitopol, a Ukrainian city that fell under Russia’s control during the invasion, reports Reuters. Ukrainian officials said Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov was kidnapped after being falsely accused of terrorism. Joe Biden announced plans to ban the import of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia in retaliation for Putin’s war on Ukraine. Biden said the ban would be part of a move by the US to revoke normal trading relations with Russia. The US has also imposed sanctions on a group of Russia’s elite including billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three relatives of Putin’s spokesperson, and lawmakers. Russia has moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform. Russian prosecutors demanded that access to Instagram be blocked as authorities moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation. Deutsche Bank and Sony Pictures, have joined the exodus of western businesses from Russia. In a statement posted on its website, Deutsche Bank said it was “in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia” and that there “won’t be any new business in Russia”. The US has accused Russia of violating nuclear safety principles. US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm said the US is concerned about “Russia’s reckless actions and violations of nuclear safety principles” on Friday, including stopping supply to parts to nuclear facilities, concerns over conditions for staff, and damage to nuclear research facilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/oct/16/morning-mail-irish-border-brexit-fix-doomsdayer-rescue-jobseeker-pain","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-15T20:04:54Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Irish border Brexit fix, doomsdayer rescue, jobseeker pain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/16/morning-mail-irish-border-brexit-fix-doomsdayer-rescue-jobseeker-pain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/oct/16/morning-mail-irish-border-brexit-fix-doomsdayer-rescue-jobseeker-pain","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Irish border Brexit fix, doomsdayer rescue, jobseeker pain","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 16 October. Top stories Boris Johnson appears to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal after making major concessions to EU demands over the Irish border. A draft text of the agreement could now be published today if Downing Street gives the final green light, according to senior EU and British sources. It is understood that the negotiating teams have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept. Johnson will still have to win over parliament on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK’s customs territory. “Northern Ireland would de jure be in the UK’s customs territory but de facto in the European Union’s,” one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement. Music festivals, cemetery upgrades and a virtual gym are among the projects to receive federal grants under the Drought Communities Program. As the government fends off criticism of its national drought response, a Guardian Australia analysis of $100m in grants awarded under the program in 2019 shows that while many shires have used it for water infrastructure projects, much of the funding has been spent on events, the purchase of equipment and maintenance work. Winton council in Queensland used part of its grant funding to provide $820,000 to the Way Out West fest – a music festival that includes high-profile international acts. Gunnedah council spent about $40,000 on “two great country music events”. At least five people are applying for every entry-level position advertised as Australia’s most disadvantaged jobseekers are forced to compete against growing numbers of underemployed people for a dwindling number of suitable jobs, a report has found. Anglicare’s Annual Jobs Availability Snapshot found that one in seven jobseekers faced difficulties getting into work, such as a disability or minimal education. As the government rejects calls to lift Newstart, the charity’s report said people were being trapped in poverty and receiving welfare penalties for failing to effectively look for work because they were forced to “compete for jobs that simply do not exist”. World A man and his six grown children have been found after living in the cellar of remote Netherlands farmhouse for years “waiting for the end of time”, local media have reported. The group of six were discovered after the oldest son, 25, visited a local bar. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he “ordered and drank five beers on his own”, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he “looked confused”, Westerbeek said. “He was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.” Russian units have begun patrolling territory separating Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Syrian army around the flashpoint town of Manbij in north-east Syria, in a clear sign that Moscow has become the de facto powerbroker in the region after the evacuation of US troops. A British family of seven were arrested in the US and subject to the “scariest experience” of their lives at the hands of the immigration authorities after inadvertently crossing the border from Canada. The Booker prize judges’ decision to break the rules and award the prize to Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo has been criticised, with detractors pointing out that the first black woman to win Britain’s most prestigious literary award has had to share it – while receiving half the usual money. Opinion and analysis If you get arrested at a rally, what do you do? Police powers differ slightly across the states and territories. Policing styles, rally permits, laws of assembly and the names of charges vary. But broadly, the process of getting arrested across Australia is fairly similar. “At the very basic level, all police need to do is tell you you are under arrest and touch you. They don’t need to do much more,” says Anthony Kelly of Melbourne Activist Legal Support, who has also been arrested 18 times. “They also need to tell you why unless there are extenuating circumstances.” He’s one of several veteran protesters who spoke to Guardian Australia about Extinction Rebellion and getting arrested. More than 60% of the Guardian Essential poll sample rate the performance of the Coalition and Labor as excellent, good or fair. The latest survey of 1,088 respondents shows 63% are positive about the Coalition’s performance post-election and 62% say the same about Labor, although Coalition voters are more positive about the government than Labor voters are about Labor, with 93% of Coalition voters affirming the government and 83% of Labor voters affirming the opposition. Scott Morrison remains comfortably ahead of Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, although the Labor leader has made up ground. Sport Australia have continued their perfect start to World Cup qualifying with a 7-1 hammering of a spirited Taiwan side in Kaohsiung. The win keeps Australia comfortably on top of Group B with three victories in as many matches before November’s clash with Jordan in Amman. Uefa has charged the Bulgarian football union over the racist behaviour of its fans at Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against England. The coaching rivalry between Michael Cheika and Eddie Jones will reach a climax on Saturday when the Wallabies meet England in the World Cup quarter-final in Oita. Thinking time: the ‘internet SS’ The gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle in Germany at one point stops during a video feed he streamed on Twitch, smirks to the camera and says “nobody expects the internet SS”. Increasingly, we should. The Halle murders follow a template of violence, one established by the massacre of 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand in March this year, and imitated by fascists since. In April a young man shot up a synagogue in Poway. Beforehand, he published a manifesto hailing the 8chan bulletin board and then tried to livestream his violence. In August another fascist murdered 22 people in a racist attack on a Walmart in Texas. He, too, posted a document on 8chan praising the NZ massacre and its perpetrator. The latest killer begins his Twitch stream with the now customary shout out to the anonymity of chan culture. “My name is Anon and I think the Holocaust never happened,” he says. To understand the “internet SS” – these men mouthing online injokes as they commit murder – it’s important to grasp just what such killers seek to achieve. They see individual terrorism as a method for channelling into action the remarkable support that fascists enjoy on the darker recesses of the internet. The architects of this strategy know that the sullen, unhappy young men attracted to 8chan already obsessed over the ever more frequent school shootings and workplace massacres in the US, imagining them as moments of transformation in which a sad loser becomes, even for a few instants, an avenging god, his diminished potency and status miraculously redeemed by the weapon with which he mows down his enemies. Media roundup The ABC leads with news that human rights reports leaked to the broadcaster “support allegations that some Australian special forces unlawfully killed an unarmed farmer and his child during a controversial raid in Afghanistan’s Uruzgan province”. Labor will “end its Twitter love affair” the West Australian reveals, with the party “considering drastically reducing its reliance on Twitter as it prepares to release its ‘warts-and-all-review’ of why it lost the election”. News.com.au reports that older Australians in aged care facilities are routinely being given dangerous medicines to control their behaviour. Coming up The CSIRO and Geoscience Australia will appear before the federal government’s nuclear power inquiry.

We’re doing our bit on climate crisis","bodyText":"Michael Barrett (Letters, 9 July) calls upon the religions to join with ecologists to take action on climate change as it offers “a compelling cause” to tackle declining memberships. We are already on board. Since Pope Francis’s letter to the world, Laudato Si’, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action. Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers – those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions. So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it’s a membership drive. It’s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it’s our moral duty to act. Christine Allen Director, Catholic Agency for Overseas Development • The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a “Dad’s Army” (Report, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support. Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can’t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more. Cllr Kevin Frea Co-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network • Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change’s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny. The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality. We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights). A citizens’ assembly should sort the details of how to reduce air travel. Mark Smalley XR Bristol, John Adams Professor emeritus and chair of Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, Hilary Burn Chair, Parish Councils Airport Association, Stephen Clarke Green councillor, Bristol city council, Tanguy Tomes Environmental consultant, Tarisha Clarke Airport Action, Dr Steve Melia Senior lecturer in transport policy, University of the West of England • That the government’s climate advisers, the committee on climate change, reveal little preparation has taken place to deal with extreme weather isn’t, in itself, a shock. What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn’t appear to get it. By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it’s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change. This change will be for the unalloyed good of all of us, as well as make for a healthier environment – even if it possibly dents some multinationals’ balance sheets. Mike Childs Head of science, Friends of the Earth • In Weatherwatch (9 July), Paul Brown highlighted the risks to nuclear power stations with climate change. As he pointed out, nuclear reactors are not a reliable source of base load power. The increasing number of heatwaves threatens their supply of cooling water, particularly in France, which exports electricity. In the UK, reactors use sea water, but there are dangers ahead there, too, with the risk of flooding from rising sea levels. Add to that the whopping costs and the dangers of terrorist attacks, technical failures, human error and radioactive contamination, and it is difficult to understand why politicians are supporting “new build” nuclear reactors. Why are they not choosing to put money and resource into sustainable energy sources? Rae Street Littleborough, Lancashire • The disavowal that leaves us heading for climate catastrophe was well captured on page 8 on 10 July, with your reports about “Dad’s Army” climate crisis preparations and David Attenborough’s warning that pollution will soon be as reviled as slavery sharing the page with an advert for a car with a twin power turbo engine and the exhortation “Don’t have fun. Have the most fun.” Breda Kingston Bath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

We’ll be back first thing tomorrow, with all the latest from Fiji and closer to shore. Here are today’s major developments: With the Pacific Islands Forum underway, Australia has resisted calls from neighbours for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions. In other forum news, the Australian and US governments have signed a deal they say will help accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement was made by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called for the health advice underpinning the decision to be released. The announcement has been criticised by health bodies including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Australia reported 58 Covid deaths on Tuesday, as both NSW and Victoria reduced the reinfection period from 12 down to four weeks. And Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. A gentle reminder we’re still in a pandemic: Man dies in Fitzroy in Melbourne A man has died in Fitzroy this afternoon after a fatal shooting occurred, Victoria Police say. Emergency services were called to Brunswick Street about 4.15pm this afternoon where the man was located with life threatening injuries. Police believe he was involved in an altercation with a number of people at a car parked on Brunswick Street before he was fatally shot. Witnesses called triple zero and ambulance crews tried to treat the man, who is yet to be formally identified, but he later died at the scene. Police have cordoned off the area and a crime scene has been established. Victoria police: Detectives are still working to determine the exact circumstances of the incident but at this stage it appears to be a targeted incident with the parties involved possibly known to each other. Police would like to speak anyone who witnessed anything or has CCTV or dashcam vision of the incident. Covid admissions up 53% in Victorian hospitals in past two weeks The Victorian government has released more information on today’s Covid update. Health authorities say there’s been a 53% increase in the numbers of Victorians in hospital with the virus in the past two weeks, as BA.4/BA.5 becomes the dominant strain circulating in the community. At the same time, the third wave of Omicron isn’t expected to peak until August. The Victorian government joined New South Wales in reducing the period of reinfection from 12 weeks to 28 days, and has pushed for Victorians to get their booster and wear masks in high risk settings. Case and hospitalisation trends are increasing in Victoria. This is in line with similar patterns globally and in other Australian jurisdictions, which have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent weeks. What is GDP? Our latest News glossary video explains When a country’s economy is discussed in the news, you often hear a number called GDP, or gross domestic product, thrown around. But what does it actually mean, and is it gross? In this episode of News glossary, Matilda Boseley explains the meaning of GDP and how it reflects economies in Australia and abroad. PM defends the scrapping of pandemic leave payments Anthony Albanese has defended scrapping pandemic leave payments, laying the blame at the feet of the previous government, AAP reports. The payments for workers who needed to spend time away from work while they isolated ended on 30 June. But there have been calls for the payments to be reinstated as Covid case numbers and hospitalisations increase across the country, driven by new, infectious sub-variants. The prime minister, who today received his fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose, said he would not bring back the payments due to the need for the government to rein in spending. The new government had inherited the former’s decision to end the payments and $1tn of debt, he said: They are circumstances which my government faces … there are a range of things we would like to do, but we intend to be fiscally responsible in how we deal with issues. As case numbers rise across the country, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said hospitals could hold back some elective surgery due to the strain on the system. He said the emergence of influenza for the first time in three years in Australia was making the situation worse. The health minister, Mark Butler, said Covid cases were not likely to peak nationally for at least four weeks during the third wave of infections. While case numbers have increased and calls have grown for mask mandates to return, the prime minister said he would follow health advice on the issue. The epidemiologist Catherine Bennett told Sky News educating the public about the risks of exposure to Covid would be more helpful than reintroducing a mask mandate. Australia has resisted calls from the Pacific for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions, in a move that could cause tensions as Pacific leaders meet in Suva this week. A key demand of Pacific nations – that Australia commit to no new coal or gas projects – will remain a point of difference between Australia and Pacific nations, as Anthony Albanese arrives in Fiji on Wednesday ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting. Labor late off the mark on foot-and-mouth disease, Littleproud says David Littleproud just appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the growing threat of foot-and-mouth disease. As if we didn’t need more things to worry about. Murray Watt, the federal minister for agriculture, has backed the expansion of electronic tagging to improve tracing of livestock to combat the risk of disease, but says it’s up to state governments to mandate it. Littleproud says he’s been too late off the mark. While I welcome the fact Murray’s going to Indonesia, we would have hoped probably last week he might have picked the phone up and tried to build on what we’d already put in place in Indonesia and Timor and Papua New Guinea. When this hit, we – not only with foot-and-mouth disease, but with lumpy skin disease – we put biosecurity officers and vets into those countries to try and ... help. What we’re concerned about is there’s no decisive action on some other measures that could be taken ... there are hundreds of people coming from Indonesia back into Australia every day. Anthony Albanese has the Australia-themed sportswear on but he’s missing the face mask flag. Throwback: Hydrogen project will need government support, energy forum hears In the closing panel of the Sydney Energy Forum, Yoshinori Kanehana of Kawasaki Heavy Industries says greater government support will be needed to progress the Japanese-Australian Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project (HESC) – an engineering milestone that makes liquefied hydrogen from coal. HESC was “so successful because of the big support from the Japanese and Australian government”, he says. Under the $500m HESC pilot project, hydrogen will be made in Victoria’s LaTrobe valley from brown coal and transported aboard a purpose-built ship to Japan, where it will be burned in coal-fired power plants. Kanehana says: At the beginning, the cost [of liquid hydrogen] may be more expensive compared to fossil fuels ... So we need operating expense help from the government. Large, vast quantity production of hydrogen will reduce the cost. This cannot be done by a single company or single country. Some researchers have raised concerns that the project could increase emissions and lock in a new fossil fuel industry. Fiji’s PM urges Pacific unity but respects Kiribati withdrawal from forum In Suva, Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, says the Pacific is “most resilient as a family”, while respecting the wishes of Kiribati and its government to withdraw from the forum. The people and government of Kiribati have always been and will remain part of our Pacific family. Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. Consumer group Choice last month revealed Bunnings and Kmart were using the technology – which captures images of people’s faces from video cameras as a unique faceprint that is then stored and can be compared with other faceprints – in what the companies say is a move to protect customers and staff and reduce theft in selected stores. Choice reported the two companies along with the The Good Guys to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), raising questions over how people’s personal information was being handled through the technology. The OAIC announced on Tuesday it had decided to launch an investigation into the personal information handling practices of Bunnings and Kmart and how they use the facial recognition technology in store. The Good Guys paused its use of the technology following preliminary inquiries from the OAIC. The OAIC said: In line with the OAIC’s Privacy regulatory action policy, no further comment will be made while the investigations are ongoing. Comment has been sought from Bunnings and Kmart. Environment protection agency needed to help Australia ‘do better’, Plibersek says Finally, Plibersek is asked about the State of the Environment Report, to be released on 19 July and expected to be “grim reading”. The report was received by the previous government in December and not made public before the federal election. Question: What would a standalone environment protection agency, the likes of which you have promised, what would it do to improve any of the findings in that report and by when? Plibersek: This is a report that is months overdue ... the fact we’ve kept it secret before the last election tells you a lot about the contents of the report. I don’t want to disclose everything today. I will tell you that this report shows that there’s been a substantial decline in a number of key areas of our environment. We need to do better. We absolutely need to do better to protect our landscapes, our threatened species, to protect the environment for all Australians. We’ve spoken about an environmental protection agency because it’s a simple fact that the EPBC Act ... is not doing its job particularly well. It’s not protecting the environment in the best way and it’s also quite slow and cumbersome. Labor ‘determined’ to invest in shift to renewable despite global energy crisis Plibersek is asked whether a warning from the visiting International Energy Agency chief that the global energy crisis may get worse before it gets better could hinder the federal government’s 43% energy reduction commitment. She says Labor remains “determined” to invest in the transition to cleaner energy. I think it’s plain to everyone that the conflict in Ukraine and other uncertainties are having an impact on energy markets around the world but it doesn’t change the fact that particularly in the medium to longer term, the best way of bringing down power prices is to see more renewables entering the market. I think this is a reminder that this transition is a huge opportunity for Australia. Of course, it has short-term difficulties, and I’m not for a moment discounting the impact that higher energy prices right now are having. This is the result of 10 years of ... neglect by the previous government. Short term, then, is there a lot of “pressure placed on [her] shoulders” to approve new coal and gas projects? (Presumably as a sort of “band-aid fix” despite the fact coalmines take a reasonable amount of time to start up and shut down.) I don’t think any serious commentator is saying that we’ve got to stop exporting Australian coal and gas tomorrow. I don’t think anybody serious is saying that. It will be part of our energy mix for some time to come and part of the global energy mix for some time. What we need to do is make sure at the same time we develop the economic opportunities of renewable energy. Australia in talks with Pacific on 2029 UN climate conference, Plibersek says The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, follows Conroy on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Still on the Pacific Islands Forum, she’s asked how much thought the federal government has given to the 2029 UN climate conference and the involvement of smaller Pacific nations. Plibersek says: We’ve started to have conversations with our Pacific neighbours about the sort of involvement they’d like to see. I met with the Samoan environment minister today, and last week when I was in Lisbon I met with a number of Pacific leaders and ambassadors from Pacific nations, and there’s a fair degree of enthusiasm for this proposal. Obviously no region in the world is more impacted by climate change than the Pacific. So, there’s a very strong interest from Pacific nations to remind the world again of what an existential issue this is for them. Australia is supporting Vanuatu’s voice on climate, Conroy says Conroy is asked about the push from Vanuatu for the international court of justice (ICJ) to seek referrals on countries that don’t meet their climate change obligations. No Pacific island nation is a party to the ICJ, yet Conroy has indicated he’s in support of the proposal. Is Australia “backing the wrong horse”? We’re backing a process. We’re being very supportive of the Vanuatu government’s efforts to get a resolution passed by the UN general assembly, that would refer a number of questions to the international court of justice for their deliberations ... we make it clear that the UNFCCC negotiations is the primary focus for achieving climate action around the globe but are supportive of the process that Vanuatu has been pursuing ... we haven’t agreed on the resolution. We’re yet to see the questions that the government of Vanuatu intends to put to the UN general assembly and we will reserve our position until we see the questions, like every other nation. This is just an example of where under the new Australian government rather than stifling climate action, rather than trying to bully and intimidate Pacific countries to stop them talking about climate action, we’re supporting their voice in multilateral forums because is the number one security threat to the Pacific and we’re very committed to being part of the solution, rather than being part of the problem. Pacific Islands Forum focused on ‘rebuilding unity’, Conroy says Now to China, “looming large” over discussions at the forum. Conroy: We made a decision to not include dialogue partners in this PIF, but the focus was on concentrating on rebuilding PIF unity. So that’s why the vast majority of the program with limited exceptions ... focused on Pacific Island Forum leaders and foreign ministers talking to each other, working on how we can renew and energise the PIF architecture. Why, then, did the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, make a pitch to members? There are some limited and specific interventions that the chair has allowed. And obviously that was a decision that the prime minister of Fiji made. So you have to go to the Fiji government as to why they did that. There are limited exceptions to that focus. The overwhelming focus is on rebuilding unity. Australia’s aid to Kiribati has no strings attached, Conroy says Asked what more Australia could do to entice Kiribati back, Conroy acknowledged it was “important that the discussions are being led by Fiji” as the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum. Yesterday, Australia committed $2m in additional assistance to help the island nation through drought. It’s counter productive for Australia to be too forward leaning. That decision around the aid package is not conditional on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum. We don’t deliver aid like that. We don’t deliver aid with strings attached, unlike other countries interested in this region. Pacific minister Pat Conroy on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum Pacific minister Pat Conroy is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, wearing a lovely shirt. Asked whether Kiribati may rejoin the Pacific Islands Forum, he replied: The leaders’ dialogue had a lot of strong language around commitment to unity and the importance of a strong united Pacific voice. That is a positive. Importantly, several Micronesian leaders were strong in the need to implement the Suva agreement and rebuild the architecture of the Pacific Islands Forum as the central architecture for the region. I wouldn’t say that I’m more optimistic about Kiribati rejoining. I’m not more pessimistic, but I think it’s one where we have to let Kiribati go through their paces, acknowledging today is their national day ... Pacific unity is vital for our shared interests. That’s what Micronesian leaders said ... and something we’re working towards. Controversial Queensland New Acland coalmine should stay closed, activists say My thought has well and truly been provoked by this Fijian cloud. On the topic of climate change, the Queensland Resources Council is lobbying the state government to expand a controversial New Acland open-cut coalmine, which would extract some seven million tonnes of coal per year and extend its life for more than a decade. Paul King from Oakey Coal Action Alliance said the mine was currently closed and should stay that way. This controversial mine expansion will risk prime agricultural land and water resources and goes against the science that tells us emissions must rapidly decrease to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. During our current food crisis, it doesn’t make sense to destroy prime agricultural land and put up to 10m litres of milk production at risk by reopening this mine. The new mining project will also use up to 1.3m litres of water a day, draining local water bores. Farmers in this area are completely reliant on this groundwater source. Local farmers and landholders are calling on the government to reject this licence and put an end to this dangerous project once and for all. RACGP backs continuation of free RATs for concession card holders The RACGP is backing the continuation of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders following the federal government’s announcement the funding would be cut. It comes amid the rollback of other Covid measures including 70 telehealth items introduced during the pandemic. Its president Karen Price says Covid “is not disappearing anytime soon” and we “must do more to reduce community transmission”. Government urged to consider shared infrastructure at Sydney Energy Forum Amanda Lacaze of Lynas has pleaded to the government to think about shared infrastructure between critical mineral and battery production at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Shared infrastructure is by definition going to be lower cost. My plead to the government is to think about shared infrastructure for these value-add activities. In Kalgoorlie, Western Australia – home to a Lyans mineral refining facility – it is “about water”, she explains. At the same time, it is “equally about minerals, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid ... it is about building the ecosystem and the capability”. If we do that, we can win ... [it] allows us to be cross-competitive. Spike in solar panel prices puts pressure on increased demand Prof Martin Green of UNSW acknowledges a spike in solar panel prices at the Sydney Energy Forum. Solar panel prices “hit an all time low in 2020”, he explains. Following a shortage in pure silicon material used in production following disturbances at three major factories, prices have “gone up about 40% per watt per solar panel”. With the “important role of solar” for climate change mitigation being increasingly “publicised”, Green points to “increased demand right at the time supply is struggling”. Disgraced former Ipswich mayor’s name stripped from bridge and street signs Ipswich mayor Teresa Harding says “common sense” has “prevailed” after the council voted to strip the name of jailed sex offender and former mayor Paul Pisasale from a bridge and street west of Brisbane. Pisasale was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to more than 30 offences. Seven of nine councillors voted to remove Pisasale’s name from the council assets on Tuesday after a decision to leave the names unchanged sparked community backlash earlier this month. Pisasale’s former deputy mayor, councillor Paul Tully, and another fellow member of the former council, councillor Sheila Ireland abstained from the vote. On Facebook, Harding thanked residents for relaying their concerns and said their voices had “been heard loud and clear”. The council has authorised its chief executive to work with the Yuggera Ugarapul people native title holders to come up with new names in line with community sentiment. A council spokesperson said in the meantime, the bridge will be unnamed and street signs with the existing name at Yamanto will remain in place. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called on the federal government to release the health advice underpinning its decision to end free Covid tests for concession card holders. She raised concern that this followed a government decision to end more than 70 different telehealth services, and the winding up of pandemic leave payments despite Australia entering into a devastating third wave of the virus. She told Guardian Australia: At a time when we are seeing a massive increase in the number of Covid cases and cost of living pressures impacting very seriously on Australians, Mr Butler must outline what expert advice has formed the basis of his decision. The pattern of behaviour in the Albanese government’s health response to Covid is worrying. There have already been cuts to 70 telehealth services, cuts to the pandemic leave disaster payments, and now cuts to the access of rapid antigen testing for concession card holders. You would have to question the timing of these cuts when it is so important that Australians are mindful of this new, dangerous wave of Covid going through our communities. Queensland monkeypox case poses ‘no general risk’ In better news, a monkeypox case reported in Queensland yesterday evening – the state’s first – poses “no general risk” and no sleep lost. Which is a relief, as there are already enough things to stay up fretting over. Number of Queensland health staff off work equal to state’s first Covid wave The number of health staff off work in Queensland is nearly equal to the state’s first wave earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there’s been no move on a tightening of restrictions, with the chief health officer acknowledging keeping Covid off cruise ships is “incredibly difficult” following a major outbreak. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia [PSA] national president Dr Fei Sim said the federal government’s announcement that the Covid-19 rapid test concessional access program will not be extended beyond July will put vulnerable Australians at risk. She said it also sends the wrong message to the public: The pandemic is not over, and the threat of serious illness is still there for many vulnerable people in our communities. Testing remains a vital part of our Covid-19 response. While recognising that our approach to test-trace-isolate has changed since the program was launched in January, testing with even mild symptoms remains an expectation of everyone in the community. She said with most states and territories adopting advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee [AHPPC] to move from a three-month to a 28-day immunity period, access to testing will be vital, especially for vulnerable groups who’ve relied on the concessional program. Earlier on Tuesday the Australian Medical Association [AMA] and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners [RACGP] said vulnerable people will be most impacted by the end of Medicare-subsidised extended telehealth consultations and a range of other telehealth items. Both organisations have written to health minister Mark Butler urging him to meet with them and discuss the changes. AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid has said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. This decision means telephone access to doctors will be significantly limited, hitting vulnerable patients hardest, including those who do not have access to high bandwidth internet and those who can’t operate the necessary IT systems. Many thanks to the lovely Natasha May for keeping us informed today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine Tuesday. Handing you over to the wonderful Caitlin Cassidy who’ll be helming the blog for the rest of the day! Sydney Energy Forum hears how Taiwan has no oil and gas Naiwen Marina Hsu of the Taiwanese branch of a fund management company specialising in energy infrastructure assets, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, told the panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today how Taiwan has “no oil and gas, at all”. In “looking to build out renewable energy”, the Chinese government has declared a net zero goal, she says. In response, “the buildout [of renewable energy manufacturing] has to be much more aggressive”. From zero to one [Taiwan] is building an offshore wind industry. 25km off the coast of Taiwan, commercialised offshore wind turbines are being constructed. [The Chinese government] just launched three rounds to build out to 15GW of offshore wind. A steady and a planned, staged policy department, together with capable private capital going in ... [and] experienced developers giving back to society by building up local industry. Emergency service volunteers being trained to fill Victoria’s ambulance staff shortage Fifty of Victoria’s fire and emergency service volunteers are being trained to provide first aid as the state’s ambulance staff are in extreme shortage. The training comes as Ambulance Victoria on Sunday issued its seventh code red emergency in as many months. Queensland energy minister calls for Australia to think about value rather than cost when it comes to renewables Mick de Brenni, the Queensland minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, emphasises thinking about spending on renewable energy as “about value ... not about cost” on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum. Value when looking at the cost of what we need to build includes consideration of reliability, quality, deliverability ... valuing the supply chains, the new business and job opportunities we create. Value means measuring the opportunity cost of not acting to develop your own capacity. It is a real threat ... if we are pushing for just low cost. De Brenni says this was the “shift” in the Queendsland government’s mindset when “thinking about investments” in renewables. NSW flood recovery and clean-up continues Agencies continue to help flood victims clean up their homes and streets. Fire and Rescue NSW said that fire crews have been cleaning up seaweed piled up in backyards at Chittaway Bay, on the Central Coast, in addition to the more usual activities of mopping up water, hosing out silt and moving ruined furniture from flood-damaged homes. At Sackville, on the Hawkesbury River, the agency has deployed its Hytrans Bulk Water Transfer unit to help pump large quantities of water out of affected areas. They’ve released a video showing some of these efforts. Agency running NDIS doesn’t understand First Nations cultural practices, inquiry hears The agency running the National Disability Insurance Scheme doesn’t understand the importance of Return to Country cultural practices to First Nations people, an inquiry has heard. The disability royal commission is this week exploring the experiences of First Nations people navigating the NDIS in remote communities over five days of hearings in Alice Springs. Beth Walker, the Northern Territory public guardian, told the inquiry the agency failed to understand the significance of Return to Country trips and did not include a specific line item for funding them in NDIS packages. She said: The NDIA doesn’t really get the importance of those Return to Country trips. They are viewed a little bit like a holiday rather than a cultural connection. That’s really important to First Nations people. And, again, there’s no specific line item in the NDIA pricing guide that covers Return to Country trips and so we are often trying to manoeuvre around people’s day to day services and pull out little bits or use other areas to fund the Return to Country trip. Walker said the logistics of planning such trips could be “extensive” because of a person’s disability needs, including mobility issues and the need for one or multiple support workers. So they are not necessarily easy things to plan, depending on the needs of the person. But the benefit and the joy that you see on someone’s face of returning and being with family is – there’s really no words to describe that. Walker also said she was concerned by cuts to the NDIS plans of some of the individuals for whom she acts as public guardian. Guardian Australia has previously reported cuts to funding packages in the NT, particularly for accomodation funding. She said: I think what I am seeing as public guardian is the winding back of people’s plans and it seems to have a financial driver rather than the needs of the person at the centre of what’s happening. And that really concerns me. Walker is the guardian for 337 First Nations people in the NT, 203 of whom living in remote communities. The inquiry continues. PM gets fourth Covid vaccine jab The prime minister Anthony Albanese rolled up his sleeve today for a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine before he departs for Fiji to attend the Pacific Islands Forum. Albanese is part of the over 50 age bracket that Atagi recommended receive an additional dose of the vaccine last week, as hospitalisations surge across the country amid another Omicron wave. Since yesterday Australians over the age of 30 have been eligible for the extra jab. Climate action must be ‘fairly shared’ across Indo-Pacific, Bowen says Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, urges the Indo-Pacific region could “lead the world in clean energy transformations” in his address to the Sydney Energy Forum. Pointing to battery, steal, hydrogen and solar manufacturing, Bowen says the region “can become the key global source of the raw materials, products and technologies that are vital to reducing emissions”. Australia is the biggest producer of lithium in the world, with 49% of global production in 2020. With battery demand expected to grow at an incredible rate over the next decade, Australia can seize the opportunity to become a critical mineral powerhouse ... Japan is setting the foundations for new clean energy supply chains in our region, investing significantly in hydrogen production, use and transport technologies. Japan and the Indo-Pacific are leading the world in hydrogen ... and ... India is on the path to becoming a solar giant, underpinned by the scale of their manufacturing sector, and spurred on by their ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of solar this year. Acknowledging the frequency and severity of both fires and floods sweeping Australia, Bowen says action on climate is both an “environmental obligation” and “in our region’s own economic interest”. It is also vital that no one is left behind. Bowen urges that the economic costs and benefits of “real action” on climate change must be “fairly shared” across the Indo-Pacific. We need to work with the leaders of emerging economies to understand and address their concerns. Bowen points to the Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, aimed to “harness Australia’s renewable potential”. It will focus on production of green, low-cost materials for wind turbines and solar PV, as well as the broader economy ... [and] strengthen emerging sectors such as hydrogen and battery production, supported by hydrogen hubs and an Australian Made Battery Precinct. Bowen’s address comes as Australia signs a deal with the US to accelerate deployment of zero emissions technology, as covered by Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor Adam Morton in the blog. First Nations people lobby to change culturally insensitive name of Queensland creek In Queensland, the Iningai and Bidjara people have successfully lobbied to change the name of Longreach’s Black Gin creek, deemed culturally insensitive to traditional owners. Bidjara man Trevor Robinson is lobbying to change the name to Watyakan, an Iningai word meaning women’s creek. In my view, not only is the current name intolerable to First Nations people but also to the wider community, especially women. State resources minister Scott Stewart said there was strong support for the name change from local council. This creek is a site of cultural importance to the traditional owners and custodians of the land and the current name does not give the site the respect it deserves. The ... government will continue to work with First Nations peoples to formally rename insensitive sites. The existing name first appeared on maps from about 1887 and covers the watercourse as it journeys from south-east of Ilfracombe to the Thompson River. Consultation with community on the name change will run until September. Australia must ‘walk the talk’ on climate, Greens leader says The Greens are pushing for the federal government to can new coal and gas projects as the Pacific Forum gets underway. Greens leader Adam Bandt said Australia must “walk the talk” on climate to bolster its position in the region. If we don’t change course ... big talk will mean nothing to our regional neighbours. We’ve promised our partners in the region that we’ll act to keep warming under 1.5 degrees, but Labor’s current climate target will make that impossible. A weak emissions reduction of 43% is consistent with at least two degrees of warming. Even the weak target of 43% by 2030 will be impossible if Labor doesn’t urgently halt new gas projects at Scarborough and the Beetaloo Basin. Pacific Island leaders want 75% and no new coal and gas because that’s what it takes to keep warming under 1.5 degrees. They’re not alone: According to applications lodged under national environment laws, the federal government could face decisions on whether to approve up to 27 coal mining developments. The RBA has released a nifty little snapshot of Australia’s economy. Millennials, avert your eyes at the average price of residential dwellings. The Australian and US governments have signed a deal that they say will help accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement by Australia’s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, was made on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, covered elsewhere in the blog by Rafqa Touma. Few details of agreement were released, but Bowen said it would put dealing with climate change at the centre of the relationship between the countries. Both ministers suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese control about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials.” Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. It prioritises not just development but deployment of the critical technologies that will underpin economic opportunity in the energy transformation of our two countries. The announcement of the Australia-US net zero technology acceleration partnership coincided with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together developing clean energy tech. New canine member added to Queensland fire and rescue squad With the many recent natural disasters, Australia’s emergency services are more vital than ever. Fire and Rescue Queensland earlier today introduced the public to Bolt, their smallest qualified urban search and rescue canine. The South Australian police made an April fools’ joke last year claiming to be introducing sausage dogs into its ranks, but Bolt appears to be a legitimate member of the Queensland service. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 58 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,174 In hospital: 140 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 20 Cases: 10,806 In hospital: 2,049 (with 58 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 481 In hospital: 39 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,768 In hospital: 860 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 3,668 In hospital: 246 (with 6 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,812 In hospital: 29 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 16 Cases: 10,627 In hospital: 737 (with 39 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,000 In hospital: 297 (with 6 people in ICU) There were 6,000 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. Calls for move to greater electricity use at Sydney Energy Forum Claudio Facchin of Hitachi Energy, urges the need to move “move 20% to 50-70% electricity” in the grid on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. He says there is comfort in “a lot of the technology needed to make that shift” being “available today” and there being “a lot of electrification across industries” on the “demand side”. Facchin says “we need do more to make everyone understand that the entire electricity system” will need to change. The scale that is needed and the pace at which we need to deliver that technology ... requires a lot of innovation. Facchin points to that innovation in “how we partner, look at business models, how we innovate across the entire supply chain, how we create policies and a regulatory environment to deploy this technology [across countries and regionally].” There were 3,668 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. India’s energy supply chain discussed at Sydney Energy Forum Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power acknowledges the issues that come with India’s growth on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. As India grows, inevitably energy consumption will continue to grow. 70% of India’s total power comes from the coal sector, with 10% from renewables, Sinha explains. A lot of the power sector still sits in the hands of government controlled entities. How policy making evolves in a sector that moves very rapidly ... is a challenge. Following on from discussion earlier this morning on China’s monopoly over the solar panel manufacturing market, Sinha says “we cannot keep importing solar panels”, urging away from dependence on “another part of the world”. India has to create manufacturing domestically. There were 1,174 new cases in the last reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. First images from Nasa’s James Webb space telescope reveal ancient galaxies Nasa today released an image showing the deepest glimpse into the universe we’ve ever seen. It’s the first image from the James Webb telescope, the most powerful telescope ever put into space. The image shows a cluster of some of the earliest formed galaxies after the big bang 13.8bn years ago. On China’s monopoly of solar power manufacturing And an audience question brings us back to the topic of China’s monopoly on solar power manufacturing at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power explains China’s manufacturing advantage of companies’ access to cheaper land, and capitol cost being a bit lower. He says the “ecosystem you build” around manufacturing of solar panels – from glass panels to glue – is key to “bringing down logistic costs”. All of that gives you a significant competitive advantage. China crossed that quite some time ago. Any country that wants to start has to start from zero. That manufacturing ecosystem “needs to get to scale before you get to a comparative end product”. Sinha warns of a 25-35% cost disadvantage for a new country entering the market. Will people be willing to pay more to support a new country manufacturing [to diversify away from China]? This is difficult ... because people want access to the cheapest power. Hydrogen could step in to reduce reliance on gas, CSIRO boss says Malcolm Turnbull, former prime minister of Australia, puts forward a question about long duration energy storage at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says, to address that question, “we need to go beyond the grid”. We need fuel to transfer massive amounts of energy quickly. Marshall warns of an expectation that a reliance on gas will persist until 2040. But he is optimistic that hydrogen will emerge as the solution. Hydrogen will be able to step in and fill in the gap to reduce the amount of storage needed. Equivalent to Europe’s use of hydro electric and nuclear energy, “we think we can do ... with hydrogen in Australia”. There were 6,768 new cases in the last reporting period, and 12 people are in intensive care. Australia needs ‘innovation’ to make clean energy transition Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says “innovation is key” in the transition to clean energy technologies on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Our biggest problem [in Australia] is our innovation dilemma. We can’t make this massive transition, bigger than anything any of us have ever lived through, if we can’t fix that. ‘Huge opportunity’ for Australia to cooperate with US on defence, Marles says Earlier, at the Centre for Strategic International Studies the defence minister Richard Marles also spoke about the possibility of greater development cooperation with the United States. Marles said development was an aspect of the US-Australia alliance that is “underdone” because there “is not the same deep, organic interoperability as in other areas such as defence”. To be glass half full about it – there’s huge opportunity to develop this and do more. Marles then gave an extended analogy about how US naval patrols around its territories including Hawaii traversed the exclusive economic zones of other countries, and could alert them to illegal fishing from “grey” vessels “pillaging” their fish. He proposed an audit of existing activities in the Pacific to determine how these could help Pacific neighbours. Bridi Rice, the chief executive of Development Intelligence Lab, said: The Australia-US alliance is missing a critical dimension for security and stability in the Pacific – development. It’s about time we heard a defence leader talking about development challenges of our region and as a serious and valuable space for US-Australian cooperation. While the political commitment to US and Australian development cooperation in the Pacific has ramped up, we fall woefully short when it comes to practice. We don’t have shared assessments, joint cooperation on the ground is scarce. That has got to change if we are going to have an effective alliance in the Pacific. Update on the second day of hearings held by the disability royal commission in Alice Springs focused on NDIS for First Nations people A First Nations woman with disability living has told of a lack of support in Tennant Creek, saying her life has become more difficult since the national disability insurance scheme arrived in town. Emily, who grew up in Mount Isa, Queensland, but now lives in the Northern Territory, had a stroke in her twenties in 2003 that left her unable to speak. She told the disability royal commission she uses an electric scooter to get around, but that her front door was too small to bring it inside. This meant she needed to charge the scooter outside by running a cable through a window. She said she was concerned her scooter would be stolen, as had occurred to others in the town. Emily also said she had an NDIS plan but that no one had told her how to use her funds. There is no NDIS office in Tennant Creek, meaning she needs to go to a Centrelink office to discuss NDIS issues. That office is not wheelchair accessible, so she can only enter using a walking stick. When asked by counsel assisting the commission, Avelina Tarrago, whether things had gotten worse since the NDIS started, Emily agreed that they had. The commission was also played a clip of Emily crossing the Barkly Highway, the main road in Tennant Creek. Emily said she was often scared crossing the bumpy road on her scooter because there were many trucks which tended to speed along the highway. Her scooter’s tyres were easily damaged on the rough terrain. The inquiry is this week investigating the experiences of First Nations people in remote communities in accessing the NDIS. Minister defied advice on mask mandates Victoria’s health minister Mary-Anne Thomas has revealed the state government defied the acting chief health officer’s advice to introduce mask mandates in a range of settings including early childhood education and some retail environments. It comes after the Victorian government last week extended the state’s pandemic declaration for another three months, citing a serious Covid risk to the public. Speaking to reporters, Thomas said the government had consulted with industry groups and other stakeholders in making its decision: We want to empower Victorians to make the best decision. Victoria today joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. Covid-carrying cruise ship under watchful eye of NSW Health When the Coral Princess cruise ship – carrying over 100 Covid positive cases – arrives in NSW the crew will not be allowed to disembark and passengers will have to return a negative RAT test, NSW Health authorities say: The vast majority of Covid-19 cases on the ship are currently in crew members. A small number of passengers have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since boarding the Coral Princess, their infections were most likely acquired prior to boarding and they subsequently tested positive. The ship is currently en route to the port of Eden on the South Coast of NSW and is also scheduled to be in Sydney for one day on Wednesday, 13 July, before travelling to Brisbane. NSW Health said it is liaising with the Coral Princess cruise ship to monitor the health of its passengers and crew members: NSW Health’s assessment is that the Covid-19 risk level for the Coral Princess during this cruise is amber, which indicates a moderate impact to the vessel. When the ship arrives at the port of Eden, NSW Health says that no crew members will disembark and all passengers disembarking will be requested to return a negative RAT result first: To further minimise the risk of transmission, passengers on shore tours will also be advised to wear masks when on transport or in other public indoor spaces, physically distance wherever possible and to regularly use hand sanitiser. ‘I want a frank, fair-dinkum review’: Perrottet on flooding Albanese and Perrottet are speaking about the future of flood-prone areas like Lismore and whether rebuilding should occur. Albanese said: I don’t think we’ve had a discussion about relocating the whole of Lismore. But what we have had on a pretty informal basis is discussion about planning. I think we’d have a common view that you can’t continue to commit the same issues and wonder why you get the same outcomes. And quite clearly planning and development in flood planes is something that is primarily the responsibility of state governments, but common sense has got to apply here as well and I’m confident that the premier will be doing just that. Perrottet said he agreed with the principle that you can’t keep doing the same things the same way and expect a different outcome: There’s no doubt these events are becoming more prevalent and I have commissioned that review. I expect to receive that review by the end of the month. I have said that I’ll make that review public. Now, a lot of that will focus on the immediate response to these disasters but there’s no doubt there will be a medium- to long-term focus and our government is already, independently of that review, working through how we plan for the long term. We need to make sure that we can stand here as leaders in a circumstance where an event like this happens in the future – which it inevitably will – that we have done everything we can to make sure we don’t make the mistakes of the past. And whether that’s development on flood plains in circumstances where not only does that cost and risk lives, but the impact on properties, homes, and businesses, which the Government, at a Commonwealth and state level will always be there to provide that financial support. That’s our job. I have said to both Mary O’Kane and Mick Fuller in relation to that review that I don’t want a political review. I want a frank, fair-dinkum review, that the government will take on board and respond. And I’ll make that report public as quickly as possible. I’ll await the legislation, says PM on assisted dying Albanese is asked how he would vote on the issue of assisted dying: We haven’t seen the bill yet. It will be a private member’s bill. I’ll look at the details of the bill. I’ve been on the record previously - I was an opponent of the Andrews bill when it occurred. The Labor Party has a conscience vote on these issues and so I’ll await the legislation that I read is being introduced by Luke Gosling from the Northern Territory and Alicia Payne from the ACT. Albanese says there are two issues at play: The issue of substance and also the issue of the right of territory governments to be able to determine their own legislation as well. That’s something that, in my view, people in Australia should not be treated any differently and with less rights if they happen to live in Canberra compared with living in Queanbeyan in the state of New South Wales, and similar issues apply to the Northern Territory. Throw out your thongs, say farmers AAP reports that farmers are urging travellers from Bali to throw out their thongs before arriving in Australia, to help stop the highly contagious foot and mouth disease. It’s been estimated the arrival of FMD in Australia could cost the agriculture industry $80b. National farmers federation president Fiona Simson said people throwing away their old footwear would be given a voucher towards a new pair of shoes. “Ringers Western will give them a 30% voucher on their return,” she said. “I never thought we’d be helping people buy new shoes to keep my cattle safe, but here we are.” Last week, biosecurity measures were strengthened at Australian airports. Detector dogs are operating at Darwin and Cairns airports and biosecurity officers are boarding flights from Indonesia to do checks of travellers arriving from Indonesia. – with AAP NSW flood relief payments being fast-tracked: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is emphasising the payments are being fast-tracked to prioritise support for victims over auditing the process. However, both he and the premier are imploring people to only apply if they are eligible: The costs so far to the commonwealth has been $514m , so this joint funding is separate from that as well. I make this point – we’re making the payments. We’re not holding them up in order to audit in advance. But we will be auditing in retrospect as well. So only people who are eligible for these payments should apply for these payments, but we didn’t want to be in a circumstance whereby people were not able to receive support because some of these people have lost everything. So the idea that you can go through and check every application before payments are made would have had a severe impact on people and would have added to the trauma which people are experiencing. Perrottet has affirmed the audit will be performed in due course and any false claims will be identified: Whether it’s through Covid payments or disaster payments, there are always people who fraudulently put registrations and applications in who are not eligible and that is disgraceful. If you do that, we will catch you out ... But from a state and Commonwealth perspective, it is most important right now that we provide that assistance as quickly as possible to those who need it and, as the Prime Minister has said, significant audits will be in place following this period. Further flood support details NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, is providing more details on what the additional funding will go towards: Today, we’re announcing significant financial assistance for those impacted by these recent floods and it’s a joint initiative with the commonwealth government. This includes grants to councils that will help with things like urgent repairs to infrastructure and helping them employ additional people to help with the flood recovery. In addition to that, we’ve committed funding for the clean-up, primary producer and small business grants and boots on the ground to assess... the recovery process. We’re at the start of the recovery and our two governments will make the necessary financial commitments to get these communities back on their feet as soon as possible. Flood support extended to eight further LGAs Murray Watt, the federal minister for emergency management, has announced an additional eight local government areas will receive support. We’re also pleased to announce today that we’ve extended that support to a further eight local government areas in addition to the 29 that had been previously announced. So there’s now a total of 37. The extra eight LGAs are Cumberland, mid-Coast, Muswellbrook, Nambucca, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Randwick and Warren, a total of 37 LGAs around New South Wales that will be eligible for those payments and they will also be eligible for the payments that have been announced by the Prime Minister and the Premier today. Perrottet pledges grants, $1m of flood support per council NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the additional supports will be available by the end of the week: The assistance that we’re announcing today ... will be available for registration by the end of the week through Service New South Wales for the business grant of up to $50,000. The primary producer grant, through the rural assistance authority of up to $75,000. With regards the council grants: This financial support today of $1m per council impacted is in addition to that financial support that we have provided in the past and we’ll continue to work with our local government areas right across the state to ensure they have the financial support they need to get their communities back on track as quickly as possible. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is announcing additional funding to support flood victims in NSW to help get people’s lives “back on track.” Clean-up immediate assistance and an initial estimated cost of $80m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that amount. Primary producer recovery grants of up to $75,000 at an additional estimated cost of $55m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that. Small businesses and nonprofit organisation recovery grants of up to $50,000 with half of the amount coming to a cost of $27m, shared between the commonwealth and New South Wales. At-flood property assessment program at an estimated initial cost of some $36m. We’ll also be providing $1m grants to each council in the 37 disaster-related declared LGAs to assist with their immediate social built economic and environmental needs. Push to replace gas with renewables amidst war in Ukraine at Sydney Energy Forum Answering a question from the audience on whether a need to reduce dependence on Russian gas amid war in Ukraine increases a need for greater investment in gas from other countries at the Sydney Energy Forum today, Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency says: I put a big question mark on if those investments will be profitable. “We have to bring gas, oil demand down,” he said, pointing to a plethora of possible alternatives. We can replace gas with renewables, with nuclear power, with energy efficiency. There are already available gas reservoirs ... We can increase production from there. There is a huge amount of methane emissions today escaping many countries around the world exporting gas ... If we catch this methane, we can help to replace Russian gas.

Asian Development Bank president addresses Sydney Energy Forum Masatsugu Asakawa, Asian Development Bank president, said “we all need to pick up the scale and pace of energy transition” at the Sydney Energy Forum today. My friends, we know transformation [to clean energy grid] is far from complete. The world needs to decarbonise. Asia and the Pacific are responsible for more than 50% of global greenhouse emissions. And it impacts small nations and the most vulnerable population. Asakawa points to a need for “collective action” on innovative solutions to “turn the tide”, urging leaders to “invest to get us on the path to a net zero future”. “In the role of new technologies ... access will be the key.” The transition to clean and efficient energy is fully compatible with robust economic growth. Minister defied advice on mask mandate Mary-Anne Thomas, the Victorian health minister, reveals she went against health advice not mandating masks indoors for several settings. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, has revealed the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. Butler was speaking to 3AW Radio about the covid crisis in Australia, confirming that 300 Australians are “losing their life every single week”, with new data suggesting “Covid is the largest killer of Australians this year, overtaking coronary disease”. Asked if the free RATs could be extended beyond July, Butler said: No, I think that expiry is about the right time. [Early in 2022] we had a very ferocious debate at a time rapid tests were very hard to get ... The price has come down dramatically, the cost was averaging $24-$25 per test in January, they’re now down to about $8 a test. Pensioners and concession card holders can still get their allocation of up to 10 before the end of the month, and that can carry them through for a period of time. There are so many RATs out in the community, many state governments provide free access ... and they’re available if you live in an aged care facility. The problem we were facing is largely resolved. Butler said Australia is “going through a difficult period” and if employers feel they are able to continue their operations with employees working from home, they should heed the chief health officer’s advice to consider allowing staff to do so. Butler asked Australians “if you’re in indoor spaces, particularly crowded ones where you can’t socially distance, think about putting mask on,” signalling he may start wearing them to press conferences again. Asked why the government isn’t doing more, Butler said: We’re deep into the third year of the pandemic. There is a level of fatigue that governments and health authorities need to reflect when putting in measurers to deal with this third wave. We’ve tried to bring new energy about the importance of getting the third vaccine dose. Interest rate hikes dent consumer confidence Consumer confidence has fallen for the second week in a row, particularly for mortgage holders being hit by higher interest rates. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence Rating saw a drop of 2.5% to 81.6, well under the last three decade’s monthly average of 112.4. Consumer confidence for those paying off a mortgage was down by a “sharp” 5.4%, the survey found. Since talk of rate hikes began in late April, consumer confidence among mortgage holders has fallen 25%, while confidence among renters is down 4%. CBA’s chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, says expected interest rate increases are likely “to see discretionary spending weaken further in coming months”. – with AAP Fog alert! Foggy conditions in Adelaide where a road weather alert has been issued by the SA state emergency service. More updates from the Sydney Energy Forum Ms Jennifer Granholm, US Secretary of Energy, says US President Joe Biden is “very enthused” about building out the clean energy transition at today’s Sydney Energy Forum: We want a modern grid with an expanded capacity. It is not just the flipping of a switch. It’s a period of time ... We want to plan responsible, with a sense of urgency. Granholm points to change being needed in the fossil fuel industry: “There is a moment for all of us to call upon diversification of fossil companies ... to become energy companies, and not just fossil energy companies,” she says, urging a move to clean energy sources, “whether it is hydrogen, or geothermal”. Clean energy development is: truly about energy security and energy independence as nations. We cannot be under the thumb of those who don’t share our values ... or under the thumb of those who [want to] control our supply chain. Climate is No 1 national security, economic challenge of region: Wong Conroy said development assistance doesn’t come “with strings attached” in reference to Pacific Island nations’ relationships with China: To demonstrate the conviction... only yesterday we announced an additional $2m of assistance to Kiribati to assist with their crippling drought, that is on top of the $600,000 we announced a couple of weeks ago. It is very important that aid is unconditional like that. Wong was asked if climate change has been overshadowed as the biggest threat facing the region and whether it will still be the centre of discussions at the forum this week. She has affirmed it remains the biggest threat the regions faces: I can only say this, that climate is central in the statements of many leaders passed, it is the number one national security, economic challenge that the region faces. Obviously, people have spoken about climate and spoken about strategic competition and have spoken about Covid and the path of recovery where there are real challenges for the Pacific. We know that there is a risk that we had a discussion today about a lower development path, what they call economic scarring as a result of Covid. This is not a region that can afford that we need to work with them to try to about that. Conroy, Wong defend Australia’s emissions target The media conference is asking Wong and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, about the adequacy of Australia’s climate stance. Conroy says it’s credible for Australia to host a COP forum when its emissions target is one of the highest in the developed world. Wong says the 43% target is “quite a substantial target” and says coal mines “will be dealt with in accordance with Australian law”: I would make the point that the target that we are proposing would see Australia adding 2% renewable energy for our domestic market by 2030. Wong says she hasn’t been asked at the forum whether Australia would not allow any more coal reserves of gas most to be utilised. Penny Wong has emphasised the importance the forum remain united, in light of the withdrawal of Kiribati from the forum: I had a very good discussion today with the secretary of FSM and we spoke about the lived experience of the Micronesian states to climate change. And, as you know, that was one of the key aspects of Prime Minister Albanese’s election campaign. I’d like to make a comment about the unity of the forum, which has obviously been a big discussion over these last week. The region is stronger together. It’s a simple proposition. The region is stronger together. And in the bilateral they have had, in the discussions I have had in my previous visits in the dialogue today, leaders talked about the challenges the region faces, climate change, Covid, and recovery from Covid, both of which have fallen harder on this region and on many other parts of the world and, of course, strategic competition. And all the nations of this region are seeking to navigate those challenges. ...and we do it best when we do it together. That is the approach Australia has taken. That is the approach the Pacific Islands Forum has taken and that is why Pacific for immunity is so important. As you know, There have been a lot of discussions about Pacific Islands Forum unity and the position the Australian government has consistently taken is we were seeking to support whatever the consensus could deliver, because the most important thing was to ensure that at this time, in a contestable, in a world confronting climate, Covid, and economic recovery from Covid, that the forum remain united. ‘We are here to listen’: Penny Wong in Suva Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, is giving a press conference from Suva where she is attending the Pacific Islands Forum. I said today at the leaders forum dialogue that we are here to listen and learn. It is obviously my first forum and it was a very important to listen to the contributions from the various perspectives of presidents and prime ministers around the table and they gained a lot from that. As they have said previously, the Australian government, the new Australian government is committed to bringing new energy and new resources to the Pacific and we recognise, in particular, the importance of climate change. China’s monopoly on solar under spotlight at forum Reporter Rafqa Touma here with some updates from today’s Sydney Energy Forum, where leaders in government and industry from around the world are gathering to discuss clean energy supply, sustainability and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of International Energy Agency, urges that leaders “need to think about” China’s monopoly on solar energy manufacturing “from an energy security perspective” at the Sydney Energy Forum today: Of all the manufacturing capacity around the world ... about 80% of the global supply chain manufacturing comes from one single country – China. China did excellently within the last 15 years to bring the cost of solar down, providing multiple benefits around the world. But at the same time, today, 80% ... is a big number. Every country “relying on technology from one single country ... is something we all need to think about from an energy security perspective”. Victoria has joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday in line with advice from the the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The previous Covid reinfection period – when people are exempt from testing and isolating – was 12 weeks. The Victorian government has also requested employers consider working-from-home arrangements, noting there has been a 53% increase in the number of Victorians in hospital with Covid over the past two weeks. All smiles in Suva Guardian Australia’s Pacific editor, Kate Lyons, is currently in Suva covering the Pacific Islands Forum. This morning, she was there for a warm greeting between Jacinda Ardern, the prime minster of New Zealand, and Penny Wong, Australia’s minister for foreign affairs. Flood toll on NSW roads emerges NSW roads are significantly damaged by last week’s floods, as this image from Wiseman’s Ferry shows. The state’s Rural Fire Service has reminded Australians the unknown condition of the roads is another reason why it’s unsafe to cross flood waters. ‘I am very uncomfortable with this voice’: Abbott on Indigenous voice to parliament The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, also shared his views on the Indigenous voice to parliament, which Labor wants to hold a referendum on as soon as 2023. Abbott told Radio National: Let me say I think the opposition is right in the first instance to demand all the detail from the government. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with this voice, with what Malcolm Turnbull called a third chamber of parliament. I’m uncomfortable electing a body determined by race. When Abbott was pulled up on the fact the voice is not a third chamber of parliament he said he was merely “citing what my successor said” – which isn’t a great way to engage in public discourse, happily repeating a misrepresentation as long as someone else said it first. Abbott continued: You can’t ask the people for a blank cheque on something as significant as this. If asked to vote on an unspecified voice, the natural response will be to say, ‘If you don’t know, vote no.’ The last thing we want is a referendum designed to forward reconciliation defeated and inevitably that puts reconciliation back. The most likely referendum proposal is to include an enabling provision in the constitution, specifying that parliament will legislate the design of the voice. Not necessarily a blank cheque, depending on how much detail is released about the design of the body to be legislated. There were 10,627 new cases in the last reporting period, and 39 people are in intensive care. ‘Finding common ground’: Albanese on nations working together Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun his opening address at the Sydney Energy Forum, emphasising the need for nations to work together towards a common good: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and laid bare challenges that we simply cannot ignore. There are many lessons that we will all take from this experience, but one of the most critical ones for me is that we are stronger when we work together. We are, for all of our differences, one common human family and we all call this one fragile planet our home. When we pause and reflect on this, we recognise our connection to one another. We recognise that we have a common stake in each other and that the best way to meet the challenges in front of us is by finding common ground. That is what this forum is about – finding common ground. And that’s the message I’m carrying with me today, a message underscored by your presence here today. The diversity and unity of purpose in this room makes it very clear – all of you coming together from across sectors and nations because you understand that our future is linked. All of us here know what needs to be done. The nature of the challenge and the science is not in question. Its urgency and scope is clear. The question is our ability, but importantly as well our appetite to seize the opportunities that it contains and to shape them in our common interests. As Prime Minister, I’m committed to renewing Australia’s standing in our region. Reporter Rafqa Touma will be bringing you more updates about Albanese’s address here on the blog but you can also read political editor Katherine Murphy’s preview. There were 10,806 new cases in the last reporting period, and 58 people are in intensive care. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) are calling on the health minister, Mark Butler, to reverse the decision to let the telehealth items lapse amidst the latest Covid-19 outbreak. The bodies want to meet with Butler to discuss the reinstatement of Covid-19 telehealth items cancelled on 1 July. Dr Omar Khorshid, the AMA president, said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. Khorshid said the item for telephone consults longer that 20 minutes with a GP – a key part of the government’s “Living with Covid” strategy – was critical and must be restored: Prescribing antivirals is time consuming, requiring a GP to consider complex eligibility requirements, contraindications and drug interactions and then arrange for patients to obtain the medication while isolating. Even simple cases take thirty minutes to an hour to properly complete. Professor Karen Price, the president of RACGP, said given the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the unknown impacts of long COVID going forward, enabling access to longer telephone consultations was vital: GPs have told the RACGP the removal of Medicare patient rebates for longer phone consultations has reduced access to care and increased health gaps for vulnerable patients. This includes rural communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, older people, people with disability and mental health concerns, many of whom already have poorer health outcomes than the general population,” Price said. The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, has praised the Albanese government’s handling of the Pacific step-up, even implicitly criticising the Morrison government for being focused on the election instead of China’s ambitions in the region. Abbott told Radio National: I think it would be very serious if China were to establish a string of military bases in the South Pacific. It’s obvious that’s China and the Beijing regime’s intention. It’s important Australia do everything it can to ensure the people of Pacific understand their peril, not just ours. Because the Beijing regime may come to these countries all smiles, but Beijing is out for Beijing’s interests, not anybody else’s. Asked if the new government had been more active than Morrison’s, Abbott replied: I certainly applaud the fact Penny Wong went to Solomon Islands almost immediately, and the prime minister is going to the Pacific Islands Forum. The new government is being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be – good on them. I don’t have the slightest criticism [of them]. Asked if it was a mistake for former foreign minister, Marise Payne, not to immediately go to Solomon Islands after it announced a draft security pact with China, he said: That’s dirty water under the bridge. I suppose at the time we were on the verge of an election campaign, and people were a bit focused elsewhere. The new government got straight down to business, good on them for that. Government to outline plans on responsible lending laws Stephen Jones, the assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, will address the Responsible Lending Summit this morning and outline the government’s plans on responsible lending laws, including buy-now-pay-later and pay day lending. The Buy-Now-Pay-Later sector currently doesn’t have the same regulations as banks do when they provide loans. If you want to hear more about the issues in the sector ahead of Jones’ address, senior business reporter Ben Butler wrote this article when Jones first announced plans for regulation. New Omicron subvariants becoming dominant in Australia Paul Kelly, the country’s chief medical officer, is on ABC and says the latest Covid-19 subvariants BA4 and 5 are becoming the dominant variant in Australia: We have seen a rise in this new variant of Omicron, so it is still the COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is just a different – slight differences in the way that that virus looks and how our immune system looks at it. We do know that this new variant has caused waves in other countries and is now becoming the dominant variant in Australia. We have no suggestion at the moment that it causes for severe disease but it escapes our immune system, whether that is due to previous infection or vaccination. We do expect that these new variants will cause a rise in cases and probably hospitalisations in the coming weeks. Kelly has reiterated the importance of third and fourth vaccine doses. Asked about the difference that reducing the reinfection period makes, Kelly says that the decisions are based on evidence as the new variants are more infectious: The new BA4 and BA5 are more infectious and there is strong evidence that you can get reinfected earlier than what was previously the case. It is important that anyone who develops symptoms again 28 or more days after they have had a previous COVID-19 infection, to get tested and to take the appropriate arrangements in terms of isolation. A new campaign has launched today to tackle racism by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Chin Tan, the race discrimination commissioner, was on ABC Radio this morning discussing the campaign he says calls on all Australians to reflect on the causes and impacts of racism, not only on its victims but Australia’s collective wellbeing as a society. Tan said the government hasn’t funded the campaign itself but its framework. Tan said the funding for the campaign had come from the corporate and private sector. Sarah Collard, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs reporter, has more on how the campaign was partly funded by a disaffected former Collingwood football club sponsor. Cronulla beach washed away by rowdy surf The dangerous surf conditions along the NSW coast is causing massive erosion on Sydney’s Cronulla beach. The North Cronulla lifeguard tower even had to be lifted out of reach of the dangerous surf via crane last night. The St George and Sutherland Shire Leader is reporting that “the tower had been perilously close to falling into the ocean after being undermined by another big swell on the weekend.” The Leader said that the Sutherland Shire Council ordered its removal early on Monday with the main section lifted off after 8pm. Mayor of the Sutherland Shire Council, Carmelo Pesce, told the Leader a new seawall at North Cronulla beach was provided for in a draft plan of management, which had recently been finalised and the council was also seeking state government assistance to repair beaches.

We have seen a rise in the number of scam texts that are occurring. These are predominantly run by criminals who are sophisticated. Some of them in Australia, many overseas, but the technology needs to keep up with that in order to keep Australians safe. Rowland is asked about the scepticism Andy Penn, the CEO of Telstra, has expressed that the new rules can actually deliver for consumers because of the difficulty stopping scam messages. She said the technology has become more sophisticated to enable these scam texts to be identified: We know for a fact as the evidence shows, in just over a year since we have had obligations in place about scam calls, we have had some half a billion scam calls being blocked. Will this mean that every scam call, every scam text and every scam email will no longer reach innocent Australian consumers? The honest answer is no. But we can make it better and we can ensure that there is consistency across the industry so that consumers have confidence that no matter who their provider is. Abbott pays tribute to Abe Tony Abbott is on ABC Radio paying tribute to Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe – “the best friend Australia has ever had from Japan”. Abbott said Abe’s designing the Quad is “the reason India is there”, which might not have been the case had it been designed by the US. He said he didn’t believe the criticisms of Abe as a WW2 revisionist are valid. History shouldn’t be used a stick ... that’s what China has tended to do with Japan. Abbott is asked about the whether the new government should be given credit for the step-up in the Pacific. He said the new government was “being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be. Good on them.” Asked whether it was a mistake not to send Marise Paine under the coalition government, Abbott said: “That’s dirty water under the bridge.” Asked whether the opposition should support a yes vote in referendum on Uluru Statement of the Heart, Abbott reinforced he did not support an Aboriginal voice in parliament and said the opposition was right to ask for more detail. ‘They need to get their story straight’ Jim Chalmers is asked about Sussan Ley’s calls to cancel the jobs and skills summit and Angus Taylor’s call for a seat at the table: They need to get their story straight. Asked about whether independents will be invited, Chalmers said the invitation list hasn’t been finalised: A hundred people sounds like a lot of people until you see who’s in the first list and who might not be. Even for the people who aren’t in the 100, we will find ways to consult with them in meaningful ways, including all parts of the parliament. When it comes to invitations for the opposition, Chalmers says: We will consider people who want to be there on their merits. Let’s see if the opposition is actually serious. I think what you just quoted from yesterday, where one person was saying it should be cancelled, another person was insisting on being invited. Let’s see if they’re serious first. I mean, they have had to bring people together in the way that we hope to bring people together. They didn’t do that. The big reason why we’ve had this waste a decade of missed opportunities in the economy, whether its energy policy chaos, or not enough Australians trained for key roles. We need to see if they’re serious, they haven’t shown so far that they are. Chalmers on a ‘wasted decade’ Treasurer Jim Chalmers is on ABC Radio discussing the jobs and skills summit he and the prime minister announced yesterday which will take place in September: There are a whole range of issues here which have combined to create what I think has been a wasted decade of missed opportunities in the economy. Too much division, too much looking for the things which divide us rather than a common ground. There’s more common ground in these areas than people realise. Asked about the calls from business to include a temporary two-year increase in skilled migration to increase it to 200,000 places a year, Chalmers says migration shouldn’t be considered the only solution when it comes to the challenges facing the workforce: We’ve had a quite unusual period when it comes to migration and as we emerge from it, we should work together to get the settings right but what I want to make sure we don’t see this as the one lever that you would pull to solve our issues and inflation and wages and labor shortages and skill shortages. We can get migration right without seeing it as a substitute for doing all of the other things in the economy, which will get that wages growth and fill these skills shortages and deliver the right kind of prosperity that we want to see into the future. ‘The Pacific is the part of the world where the US rightly looks to Australia to lead’ Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has warned of the use of “force or coercion” in the South China Sea and “intensification of major power competition” – references to China’s rising power in the Indo-Pacific. Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the US, higher defence spending and to address climate change in part as a national security issue: All of us here today understand the challenges we face: a military build-up occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons that challenge our military capability edge; expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities which blur the line between peace and conflict; and the intensification of major power competition in ways that both concentrate and transcend geographic confines. These trends compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific. For the first time in decades we are thinking hard about the security of our strategic geography, the viability of our trade and supply routes, and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few. In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed. On Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, where Australia is racing to persuade nations not to follow Solomon Islands’ lead in signing a security pact with China, Marles said: The Pacific is where Australia must invest in effective regionalism by reinforcing the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional institutions that are so key to regional resilience and agency. We must do this not only because of our unique connections to the Pacific but because Pacific security so directly impacts on our own security. Given this reality, the Pacific is the part of the world where the United States rightly looks to Australia to lead. And we will. We will not take our status for granted. Pacific Island countries have choices about their partners. And we will work to earn their trust. The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity and transnational crime. Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific. SMS scam protections Australians will be better protected from text message scams as new regulations for telecommunications companies come into effect today. The code, registered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) today, will require the companies to trace, identify and block SMS scam messages, and publish information for customers on how to identify and report scams. Mobile phone companies could face up to $250,000 in fines for failing to comply with the new code. Reporter Josh Taylor has more: NSW Health today announced that – effective immediately – the Covid reinfection period is now four weeks, down from 12. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday, in line with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Tasmania had already changed its reinfection period on Friday last week. Anyone in the state experiencing Covid symptoms from 28 days after their isolation ends is now required to test for the virus. In a statement, the chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said the new advice was due to the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants “circulating widely in NSW”: They are more able to evade immunity gained from previous infection and vaccination reinfection is more likely and possible just weeks after a prior infection. This post was amended on 12 July to add the date Tasmania changed the reinfection period. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is due to make the opening speech at the Sydney Energy Forum today. He will tell the forum Australia has rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partners” on climate action. He’ll be making the speech before travelling to the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where leaders are set to meet later in the week. Covid-19 hospitalisations are surging in Australia from the winter Omicron wave, with pressures on hospitals leading to some elective surgeries being cancelled and paramedics overwhelmed. In NSW the Covid reinfection period has been reduced to four weeks down from 12 weeks previously, from today. The first monkeypox case has been detected in Queensland. The state’s authorities say the public health risk is “very low” but it comes after community transmission was found in NSW last week.

Limits for air pollution have been exceeded on main roads in Bridgwater on multiple occasions this year, while Highways England data shows truck numbers have increased by more than 20% since building work started in 2016. On some roads, two heavy goods vehicles pass through every minute. Not all are delivering to Hinkley but, with no bypass built for the nuclear site, locals say it has made the town unnavigable at times. Buses transporting 4,000 construction workers to the site add to the traffic – and the influx of workers is pushing up rents. Rat runs are in gridlock and a town that is home to just under 40,000 people is experiencing London-level traffic on some roads. Friends of the Earth, which looked at the air quality data for 2018 and 2019 provided by the local Sedgemoor district council, said it was concerned about the high incidences of particle matter on some roads. Data shows that particle matter measuring 10 micrometers (PM10) has exceeded safe limits on Quantock Road 16 times already this year, while on nearby Bristol Road those limits were exceeded 15 times. The latest data for traffic shows the number of HGVs has increased from 470 a day in 2014 to 900 in 2018 on Quantock Road, the principal artery out of the town to Hinkley. For nearby Horsey Level, the number of trucks a day is registered at almost 1,500, while on Taunton Road, the main road coming from the M5’s junction 24, residents have to endure 1,050 a day, making it difficult to cross the road and forcing many cyclists on to the paths for their own safety. HPC says the number of HGVs travelling every day to and from the site is capped at 750. For Neal Balcombe, who bought a house off Quantock Road, the stress it is causing to his life is almost unbearable. “When I first looked at my house I fell in love with it,” he said. “It is detached, it has a lovely big garden, trees behind it. There was a road behind it, but it was tolerable. Now, if you sat in my garden at 4pm on a sunny afternoon and tried to have a conversation you wouldn’t be able to hear each other.” “Levels of air pollution in the area are unhealthy and over standards set for particle pollution by the World Health Organization,” said Jenny Bates, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “These aren’t just arbitrary guides – they’re set to protect our health. Particle pollution is the most dangerous, finding its way deep into our lungs and even bloodstream.” EDF rejects accusations that it is to blame. “Our cameras at two of the busiest junctions in Bridgwater show that in peak-hour morning traffic, HGVs delivering to the construction site account for less than 10% of the total HGVs on those roads,” said a spokesman, Gordon Bell. Hinkley also points out any HGV delivering to the site must be compliant with European standards minimising emissions. “In terms of pure percentage our vehicles are a low proportion. We provided money for Sedgemoor to put in place air quality plans. I don’t think we are the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” said HPC’s lead planner, Andrew Goodchild. This is of little solace to residents who complain of the noise, the nuisance and congestion. The endless convoy of buses taking thousands of workers to and from the site each day is an added headache, says Brian Smedley, the leader of the Labour council in Bridgwater. Hinkley agreed a fund to fit double-glazed windows on some of the busiest roads in Bridgwater. It says this is a goodwill gesture and not an admission of responsibility for the noise of HGVs. “EDF have paid to replace all my windows, and it’s made no difference. On a summer’s night, I’m not able to sleep with the windows open at all,” said Balcombe. “I am woken up every morning at 5am from the noise of lorries. And when these lorries are empty the clatter they make is unbelievable with the metal bouncing round.” HPC points out that the HGV movements will ease in the autumn when it switches supplies to the sea. The jetty is now complete and the permission it got for an extra 250 HGVs a day will expire. For Bridgwater locals a bypass would have been the answer and helped relieve the town of its perennial traffic problem. The former Labour councillor Mick Lerry, who was involved in the fight for a bypass, said the attempt was stymied because it was never part of the development consent order submitted by EDF. “As it was not part of the application, it could not be considered,” he said. The government said it had considered the impact of HGVs on Bridgwater and was satisfied. “Hinkley Point C is a key part of meeting our target of net-zero emissions by 2050, and will provide an enormous boost to the local and national economy. “Traffic, air quality and noise effects were all considered during the application process. We were satisfied that the developer agreed appropriate proposals to limit HGV traffic,” said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Sedgemoor district council said it had made representations over the impact but the decision to give the go-ahead to Hinkley was out of its hands. “SDC takes the health of its residents extremely seriously and made a strong case through the Hinkley Point C local impact report on the wider impacts of the project,” it said. Residents on Taunton Road are living with London-style traffic, with numbers of vehicles a day coming close to some of the capital’s busiest. Transport for London figures show that King’s Cross, also a large building site preparing for Google headquarters as part of a major regeneration programme, had just over 2,000 HGVs a day last year. But it is not a residential road. Nearby Caledonian Road had 295 HGVs by comparison while Nine Elms in Vauxhall, a busy junction where pollution levels have already exceeded safe levels and which is home to luxury high rises, endured 1,134 HGVs a day, fewer than some roads in Bridgwater."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/sep/11/morning-mail-trump-fires-bolton-johnson-revisits-backstop-angus-taylor-saga","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-10T20:57:36Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump fires Bolton, Johnson revisits backstop, Angus Taylor saga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/11/morning-mail-trump-fires-bolton-johnson-revisits-backstop-angus-taylor-saga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/sep/11/morning-mail-trump-fires-bolton-johnson-revisits-backstop-angus-taylor-saga","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump fires Bolton, Johnson revisits backstop, Angus Taylor saga","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 11 September. Top stories Donald Trump has fired John Bolton, his national security adviser, in tweets which laid bare searing internal divisions within his inner circle, saying he had “disagreed strongly” with his top aide. The president’s firing of his third national security adviser in as many years appears to have caught even the White House by surprise. Bolton himself added to the confusion, commenting minutes after his public dismissal that he had offered to resign on Monday night but that Trump had replied: “Let’s talk about it tomorrow.” “Trump hired Bolton to break things, like the Obama administration legacy and the orthodox foreign policy establishment in general. Now, with the 2020 election coming, a downturn looming and a second presidential term in doubt, Trump is trying to build a foreign policy legacy of his own – or at least a reasonable impression of one,” writes Julian Borger. Here’s how Bolton’s departure is likely to affect US foreign policy. The EU is looking to the Northern Ireland-only backstop to break Brexit deadlock, pinning its hopes on British negotiators reverting to the approach that was previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK. With Boris Johnson facing a choice between breaking his word and extending the UK’s EU membership beyond 31 October or bringing back a tweaked deal for a last-gasp vote in parliament, officials and diplomats have expressed hope that the prime minister will make a U-turn. Environment department officials were acutely sensitive about meeting Angus Taylor over critically endangered grasslands while his family’s company was being investigated for alleged illegal land clearing in New South Wales, according to internal emails. The information is revealed in correspondence that had previously been partially redacted from documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. It comes after Labor again pursued the energy and emissions reduction minister in question time on Tuesday and called on him to resign over the saga. Former Liberal leader John Hewson has called on Scott Morrison to grant government MPs a conscience vote on a motion declaring a climate emergency. Hewson, who will join MPs on Wednesday to champion the new parliamentary motion which is being pursued by the Greens and is supported by most of the lower house crossbench, told Guardian Australia there was no controversy associated with declaring a climate emergency in 2019, “because my view is it was an emergency 30 years ago”. World Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will annex large swathes of the occupied Palestinian territories if he is re-elected, a decision that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians’ aspirations of statehood. A Turkish newspaper has revealed Jamal Khashoggi’s last words before he was apparently drugged and lost consciousness. The Saudi journalist urged his killers not to cover his mouth because he had asthma and could suffocate, according to Turkey’s Sabah newspaper. An Iranian female football fan has died a week after setting herself on fire outside a courtroom after learning she may face six months in prison for trying to enter a stadium, a news agency reported on Tuesday. The operator of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will have to dump huge quantities of contaminated water from the site directly into the Pacific Ocean, Japan’s environment minister has said. Gwyneth Paltrow has been revealed as a “a crucial source” in the Harvey Weinstein revelations, in a new book which says the actor was scared of going on the record at first but then encouraged other women to speak out. Opinion and analysis Photographer Robert Frank, who has died aged 94, helped to change the direction of photography. The Swiss-born photographer’s seminal book The Americans, which had an introduction from author Jack Kerouac, featured 83 pictures rejecting many conventions of photography up to that point. The black-and-white images are considered Frank’s masterwork and focused on figures from the overlooked margins of American life – from teenage couples and factory workers to bikers. Dubbed the “Manet of the new photography” by the New Yorker critic Janet Malcolm, Frank was considered the father of “the snapshot aesthetic”, which captures a spontaneous moment taken on the fly. Can we save the world, one tree at a time? asks Van Badham. Bushfires are raging across Queensland and NSW. At the same time Australia faces a land-clearing crisis, although we know that deforestation drives more forests to burn, writes Badham. “And this is why both habitat protection and active reforestation and revegetation has to be prioritised by governments – at all levels – in the pressing climate fight. The battlefront is not only to save the forests we have left, but to properly revegetate the spaces humanity has already taken over – for while wildlife areas perish, cities are also warming.” Sport The Socceroos have earned a comfortable 3-0 win over Kuwait in the opening 2022 World Cup qualifier. In front of a hostile away crowd, Australia showed no signs of rust despite only playing one game since January as they surged at the hosts’ backline at the Al Kuwait Sports Club Stadium on Tuesday night. England’s Jimmy Anderson believes he can become the world’s No 1 Test bowler once more. To make this goal a reality, he now plans to study how other elite athletes prolong their careers. Thinking time: The French Fleabag Mouche, or the French Fleabag, is a near replica of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s hit TV series, with Paris taking the place of London and Camille Cottin in the title role. What Cottin delivers, though, is by no means a tribute act to Waller-Bridge. To call her elegant would be insufficient. Cottin has a whole munitions depot of self-possession and chicness that gives her performance a more knowing, and also more mournful, edge. At 40, she’s older than Waller-Bridge was, but she doesn’t have more maturity – just less goofiness. Cottin’s breakthrough show, Connasse, came out in 2013. The timing of her next TV show, Call My Agent, was fortuitous: with the benefit of subtitles and Netflix distribution, Cottin reached an international audience for the first time. Call My Agent, about a talent agency, has been a fantastic calling card, illustrating how much greater Cottin’s range was than “clown”. It generated a lot of discussion, partly by being great, and partly because it was, as she says, the first prime-time French drama to feature a lesbian whose “homosexuality was not the subject. The subject is how it is hard for her to commit to a relationship, because what she likes is the act of seduction. The fact that she likes women is completely accepted.” Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald’s front page announces the cashless welfare card has “failed”. The Australian reports that there isn’t enough water available to conduct major environmental flows in the northern Murray-Darling River basin, and that environment minister Sussan Ley is “bracing the public for horrendous environmental consequences in coming months.” The ABC reports: “The most powerful bureaucrats in Australia have been wargaming to prepare the country for “national-scale systemic climate risks” that could impact “the full spectrum of human activity” and are already ‘overwhelming’ the country’s ability to respond.” Coming up Friends of the Biloela Tamil family stuck in detention on Christmas Island will go to Parliament House with more than 250,000 signatures supporting their release.

Indeed, the bank’s advisers have a slippery job on their hands given the speed of the descent in the share price. When Metro finally conceded in February that it would need fresh funds, its share price was £15. Now it is 475p, down 11% on Monday, valuing the lender at just £500m. A call for £350m of fresh equity at this point amounts to an appeal for a complete recapitalisation. One assumes what Metro calls its “committed standby underwriting agreement” is watertight, because it’s the only piece of good news in this saga. In short, the underwriting banks – RBC Capital Markets, Jefferies and KBW – are on the hook if the shareholders turn wobbly. This service won’t be cheap, but it was plainly necessary. As it happens, Metro says feedback from existing shareholders and potential new investors “continues to be positive”. OK, but would the mood improve if Vernon Hill, its idiosyncratic chairman and founder, agreed to spend more time with his Yorkshire terrier? Almost certainly, yes. Hill must surely be trying the patience of even his US fanclub, as the local cause of this calamity for investors was a basic banking error – the allocation of £900m of property loans into the wrong risk-bracket, with a heavy knock-on effect on capital ratios. A senior head would normally roll after such a self-inflicted blow. If chief executive Craig Donaldson is deemed too important to operations (for now), then a new outside chairman is a minimum requirement to improve boardroom credibility. The share price has fallen 88% in 14 months. To believe, as Hill apparently does, that the entire board can carry on regardless is ridiculous. More bad news for Centrica investors How to signal a dividend cut in the offing: announce a “strategic update” for July and say it will include “reflections on the current business portfolio” and cover “the group’s financial framework”. These are loaded phrases to use when, like British Gas owner Centrica, your shares yield a theoretical 12.5%. The only live debate in the City is whether the distribution to shareholders needs to be chopped by a third or a half. The better news for investors was that Centrica expects to meet its cash flow and debt targets this year. But that’s as good as Monday’s trading statement got. A net 183,000 of household customers, or about 1% of the total, departed in the first four months of this year. The unwanted 20% stake in nuclear power group British Energy is still hanging around, delivering the usual news about outages. And Centrica doesn’t like warm weather or lower natural gas prices. The company called these events a “perfect storm”, but many of the same pressures were present four years ago when chief executive Iain Conn unveiled his first strategic review. Even in those days, he used to grumble about falling energy prices and “the changing trends in demands and customer behaviour”. He was still able to conclude back then that, after a bracing 30% divi cut, Centrica could focus on delivering “increasing shareholder value in the next phase through both returns and growth”. It hasn’t worked out that way, to put it mildly: the share price has slumped from 270p to 95p. So why was Conn awarded a £776,000 bonus for 2018? The company’s laughable explanation, more or less, is that the shares managed to tread water at 135p-ish for the 12 months under review. Such heroically self-serving logic persuaded City fund managers to nod through the pay report with an 85% approval rating at Monday’s annual meeting. Baffling. Trouble coming down the tracks for FirstGroup Weeks of fun lie in prospect at rail and bus group FirstGroup now that US-based Coast Capital is waving its 10% stake in anger and aiming to defenestrate half the board. It even has Steven Norris, Tory transport minister of yesteryear and source of many entertaining headlines in the 1990s, lined up for appointment. The timing of the assault is slightly odd, as FirstGroup will be unveiling full-year results at the end of this month. We’ll await the board’s case for the defence before passing judgment, but the irate Americans are asking one good question about rail franchising: if Stagecoach fears the government’s demands on pensions could be ruinous for operators, why is FirstGroup proceeding at full speed on the west coast? The same question was asked in this column recently. FirstGroup has yet to provide an answer. It should."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2019/aug/09/the-abyss-james-cameron-30th-anniversary-sci-fi-epic-love","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-09T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"The Abyss at 30: why James Cameron's sci-fi epic is really about love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/09/the-abyss-james-cameron-30th-anniversary-sci-fi-epic-love","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2019/aug/09/the-abyss-james-cameron-30th-anniversary-sci-fi-epic-love","fields":{"headline":"The Abyss at 30: why James Cameron's sci-fi epic is really about love","bodyText":"James Cameron’s The Abyss was released in theaters on 9 August 1989. Exactly three months later, the Berlin Wall was demolished, putting a symbolic end to the Soviet bloc and the decades-long tensions that went along with it. It’s easy to forgot how closely these two events coincided, perhaps because Cameron’s films have always seemed directed toward the future, deploying technologies that wouldn’t take hold in the industry for years later. But The Abyss is as old to us now as Alfred Hitchcock’s North By Northwest or Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot was to audiences in 1989, and it is the product of a generation that grew up fearing nuclear annihilation. Expected it, even. Yet the message of The Abyss wasn’t bandied about much at the time, in part because that aspect of the film was badly mangled for the theatrical cut (more on that later) and in part because the presumed folly of its making was taking up much of the oxygen. It’s a pattern that would repeat itself later in Cameron’s career with Titanic and Avatar: reports of cost overruns and directorial hubris, followed by a film that hit the culture like the tsunami it didn’t get to see back in 89. The Abyss wasn’t nearly as successful as the other two, granted, but it did push blockbuster art forward, anticipating the leap to digital effects that would seize Hollywood in the next decade, starting with Cameron’s own Terminator 2: Judgment Day two years later. The production stories aren’t worth rehashing in full, though it seems likely that the behind-the-scenes discord on The Abyss would be mentioned in the same breath as Apocalypse Now or Fitzcarraldo if its making had been documented as closely or if its stars, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, had not refused to discuss it. Even a promotional junket couldn’t keep the toxic floodwaters from gushing into outlets such as the New York Times, which described a harrowing six-month affair where 40% of the action took place underwater, in two tanks at an abandoned nuclear power plant in South Carolina. Beyond the notorious challenges of shooting on water – which famously tamed Steven Spielberg on Jaws, a film that spends far more time on dry land – the tension between Cameron and his three lead actors was often explosive. (Cameron expressed “limited sympathy” for them on the promo tour, which happens precisely never on those things.) In broad strokes, The Abyss is Cameron’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a big-hearted sci-fi epic about the interchange between humanity and aliens of uncertain motivation. It also returns Cameron to the militaristic tough-talk of Aliens, only here a few navy seals, led by Michael Biehn’s duplicitous Lt Coffey, join forces with a blue-collar oil-rigging crew that has more in common with the commercial refinery towers in Ridley Scott’s original Alien. When a US submarine sinks mysteriously near the Cayman trough, the roughnecks aboard an underwater drilling platform, led by foreman “Bud” Brigman (Harris), are asked to take part in the investigation, which involves nuclear warheads. (Or to put it in Cameron-ese: “Jesus Christ, it’s World War III in a can!”) Coffey is accompanied by the rig’s designer, Dr Lindsey Brigman (Mastrantonio), introduced as “Queen Bitch of the universe” before Bud, her estranged husband, grumbles about how hurricanes should be named after women. The visual wonders of The Abyss haven’t been blunted by time, though the CGI, at that stage of its development, looks much better in the deep, dark sea than above the surface. At 12,000-plus feet below, the alien platform looks like an arcade Atlantis, a cross between the Star Gate from 2001: A Space Odyssey and a neon paradise; in the sunlight, it’s more like a wavy slab of slick plastic. The creatures themselves, glowing and undulating like purple amoeba, now seem like a prototype for Avatar’s color scheme, but the simplest effect, of water taking shape and breaking apart, is the most arresting. A scene where a wormlike shaft of seawater mirrors Bud and Lindsey’s faces is the one genuinely Spielbergian moment in the film, and presages the liquid metal Cameron would marshal to such great effect in T2. Between the 140-minute cut released to theaters in 1989 and the 171-minute special edition unfurled on LaserDisc in 1993, The Abyss gained in interest and reputation, if only because the longer cut substantially changed the finished product. It was Cameron, not the studio, who opted for the shorter version, which is unquestionably better paced and more focused, and without the high cheese of alien beings communicating anti-nuclear sentiments via cable news clips. Yet the thematic heart of the film is weakened in the theatrical version, which feels like a studio hack job even if Cameron was ultimately responsible. It may be tacky to write a story about underwater creatures who rise up to protest nukes – and who spares humanity from mega-tsunamis because of one man’s texts to his wife – but it was a mistake not to commit to it. For all its mammoth ambition, both as technical marvel and political statement, the one unvarnished triumph of The Abyss is the love story. Perhaps those 70-hour weeks under Cameron’s dictatorial hand forged the right mix of exhaustion and esprit de corps between Harris and Mastrantonio, but they suggest a bond that may be messy and contentious, but deepens under duress. Bud and Lindsey watch each other drown and come back to life in the final third of the film, which would feel like emotional overkill if the two actors weren’t giving so much of themselves in willing for the other’s resurrection or if Cameron didn’t believe in this screwed-up marriage so fervently. In the editing room, Cameron cared more about salvaging this relationship than saving the planet. When Bud gets his message from the deep and texts it back to humankind, the line “They’ve left us alone, but it bothers them to see us hurting each other” is intended to be about the horrors of war, but it is just as much a statement about romantic partners who have sabotaged their own union. “They want us to grow up and put away childish things,” the message continues. “Of course, it’s just a suggestion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-11T13:00:11Z","webTitle":"Tory MPs five times as likely to vote against climate action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action","fields":{"headline":"Tory MPs five times as likely to vote against climate action","bodyText":"Conservative MPs are almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties, a Guardian analysis of 16 indicative parliamentary divisions over the past decade has revealed. The Tories also registered many more donations, shares, salaries, gifts and tickets to sporting events from fossil fuel companies, petrostates, aviation companies and climate sceptics, according to declarations made in the parliamentary record of MPs’ interests between 2008 and 2019. The Guardian, in collaboration with the investigative environmental journalism group DeSmog UK, rated MPs from 0% to 100% based on 16 parliamentary votes since 2008. The selection sought to cover a range of measures that would affect the UK’s carbon emissions, with an emphasis on votes where MPs were willing to break ranks and put the climate before their party. The analysis shows that although most politicians publicly express support for ambitious long-term climate targets, when it comes to short-term measures to reduce the UK’s carbon footprint, those in power are less likely to make this a priority. The scores are not intended to be a definitive evaluation of an MP’s green credentials – both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrat parties complained they had been hard done by. But experts said the scores were an important tool for voters to make a choice through a climate prism with a potential general election looming. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero. Although the prime minister has at various times said it was important to cut emissions, records show he voted five times against bills or amendments that could have had a positive climate impact. He was also among 10 ministers who received donations or gifts from oil companies, airports, petrostates, climate sceptics or thinktanks identified as spreading information against climate action. The average voting score of Johnson’s cabinet was 17%, compared with the Labour shadow cabinet score of 90%. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, scored 92%. Labour MPs were far less likely than Conservatives to receive gifts or money related to fossil fuel interests. This is partly because they are in opposition and tend to rely more on donations from trade unions. One of the MPs most consistently opposed to measures to tackle climate change was Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) politician who notoriously organised a “Climate Fools’ Day” parliamentary event in 2010 that gathered sceptic MPs. The MP who received legitimate donations from the widest range of denialist and fossil fuel sources was the former international trade secretary Liam Fox. For the emissions-related votes, Conservative MPs averaged 17%, while non-Conservatives scored 80% on average. This breaks down as Labour 86%, Liberal Democrats 51%, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru 100%, Change UK 59% and the DUP 62%. Sinn Féin had no score because its MPs boycott parliament. The average MP’s score was 50%. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, scored 50%, largely because Lib Dem MPs were often whipped to vote alongside the Conservatives during the 2010-15 coalition government. Her party’s overall voting average fell from 59% to 51% after the recent admission of former Tory Brexit rebels – inclusions the party said were unfair. A Lib Dem spokeswoman said a different selection of votes would have resulted in a higher scores for their MPs. The Guardian approached all the main political parties about the scores, explaining the methodology and how they were intended as a tool for the electorate. Their initial response was sharply divided. While Labour broadly welcomed the study, the Lib Dems questioned the methodology. A Conservative spokesperson said the findings were “complete nonsense”. “Addressing climate change is a top priority for the Conservative party, which is why in June we became the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming by 2050. Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking world-leading action on climate change. We have reduced emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.” A press officer for Corbyn said it was a “very valuable project for voters”. A Labour spokesperson added: “We’re proud that Labour has a long history of leading the way on the environment, as this analysis clearly shows. I would hope that no concerned MP feels compelled to ever again vote against legislation that will tackle climate change.” The Lib Dems said the party was proud of its record. “In government we presided over the largest increase in renewable generation ever seen in the UK’s history,” a party spokesperson said. “Since 2015 the Tories have consistently undermined the UK’s progress on tackling the climate emergency, as have Labour through their tacit support of Brexit. Liberal Democrats demand better. We are the only national party serious about tackling the climate emergency and we have radical plan to cut emissions to net zero by 2045 at the very latest.” Before seeing the results, Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem head of the Commons science and technology committee – who scored 62% – said: “It’s a good thing this is being done by the Guardian. MPs are leaders and we need to be held to account.” The Green party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas – who has consistently been a leader on environment issues – registered 92%. It was not 100% because she voted to keep nuclear power subsidies relatively low. Lucas and many environmentalists argued the subsidies would be better spent on cheaper, safer forms of renewable energy. The analysis, which covers 16 votes since the 2008 Climate Change Act, shows politicians of all stripes are less likely to vote for climate action when their party is in government and, with notable exceptions, follow the party whip. The top-scoring Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith (67%), often voted against his own party in favour of measures that would help to stabilise the climate. The second-lowest-scoring Labour MP, Graham Stringer (57%), is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a UK-based organisation that denies the urgency of the climate crisis, and was one of only two MPs who voted against the 2014 conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that humans bore most responsibility for climate change. Lucas said MPs should rethink their priorities. “The climate emergency is a global crisis, more important in the long term than Brexit, but it doesn’t attract the same commitment and that’s simply not good enough,” she said. “MPs need to wake up to what people want: tougher action, more ambitious targets and a real sense of urgency.” The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said parties should maintain a consensus about the scale of the challenge but should battle over the measures needed to achieve the UK’s goals. “The climate emergency will be on the ballot paper at the next general election,” he said. “Parties need to fight it out on who really gets it, is willing to match rhetoric with action and grasps the overwhelming need to act now rather than later.” Analysts said that in the past, voter apathy had persuaded MPs they would not be judged on this issue. “The problem is with the silent majority of MPs,” said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University, who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global heating. “Very few politicians in the UK deny the science of climate – but there are not many that are very active on climate issues, either. The vast majority sit in between: they say the right things when required, but they don’t champion the issue or spend time on it. They don’t perceive that it’s a priority for voters.” Dave Timms of Friends of the Earth said: “There is still a broad consensus for the overall target, but when it comes to making the hard choices needed to achieve that target, climate action is at a standstill.” Additional reporting by Lucy Campbell, Nur Pirbhai, Christine Parry and Hanako Lowry"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/dec/20/new-offshore-windfarms-push-uk-renewables-to-record","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-20T12:17:38Z","webTitle":"New offshore windfarms push UK renewables to record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/20/new-offshore-windfarms-push-uk-renewables-to-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/dec/20/new-offshore-windfarms-push-uk-renewables-to-record","fields":{"headline":"New offshore windfarms push UK renewables to record","bodyText":"Almost a third of the UK’s electricity came from renewable sources between July and September, as wind turbines and solar panels helped achieve a quarterly record for green energy. Major new offshore windfarms connecting to the grid pushed renewables to 33.1% of electricity generation across the quarter, up from 30% the year before. The speed at which green energy projects are being installed has resulted in records tumbling this year. Wind power broke records during the “beast from the east”, which was eclipsed during Storm Diana last month, and again this week when wind generation hit 15GW on Tuesday. The trend is expected to continue next year as more windfarms around the coast near completion. Initial analysis of some recently built offshore projects also shows they are generating more power than expected. Meanwhile, gas and coal slumped to a new low of just over 41.1%, according to official statistics published on Thursday. Environmental groups said the progress showed the government should rethink its backing for nuclear and fracking, and give its full support to renewables. “Solar and wind technologies are powering ahead, beating new records for low costs and high production despite unhelpful government interventions,” Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Par, said. Low carbon sources of power, which include the country’s eight nuclear power stations, account for 56% of the UK’s electricity supply. The 50% mark was hit only two years ago. Figures also show that householders appear to be rushing to install solar panels before incentives end next year. More than 4,700 solar schemes were fitted in November, the highest in more than two years. The vast majority were of the size households would install. “This could be due to the upcoming closure of the feed-in tariff scheme in March 2019,” the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. It announced this week that the scheme’s closure would also mean households installing solar in future having to give away unused clean power for free."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/28/british-nuclear-power-stations-could-be-forced-to-close-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-28T15:28:07Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power stations 'could be forced to close' after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/british-nuclear-power-stations-could-be-forced-to-close-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/28/british-nuclear-power-stations-could-be-forced-to-close-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power stations 'could be forced to close' after Brexit","bodyText":"Nuclear power stations would be forced to shut down if a new measures are not in place when Britain quits a European atomic power treaty in 2019, an expert has warned. Rupert Cowen, a senior nuclear energy lawyer at Prospect Law, told MPs on Tuesday that leaving the Euratom treaty as the government has promised could see trade in nuclear fuel grind to a halt. The UK government has said it will exit Euratom when article 50 is triggered. The treaty promotes cooperation and research into nuclear power, and uniform safety standards. “Unlike other arrangements, if we don’t get this right, business stops. There will be no trade. If we can’t arrive at safeguards and other principles that allow compliance [with international nuclear standards] to be demonstrated, no nuclear trade will be able to continue.” Asked by the chair of the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee if that would see reactors switching off, he said: “Ultimately, when their fuels runs out, yes.” Cowen said that in his view there was no legal requirement for the UK to leave Euratom because of Brexit: “It’s a political issue, not a legal issue.” The UK nuclear industry would be crippled if new nuclear cooperation deals are not agreed within two years, a former government adviser told the committee. “There is a plethora of international agreements that would have to be struck that almost mirror those in place with Euratom, before we moved not just material but intellectual property, services, anything in the nuclear sector. We would be crippled without other things in place,” said Dame Sue Ion, chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, which was established by the government in 2013. She said movement of the industry’s “best intellectual talent” was made easier by the UK’s membership of Euratom. The government said it was working on alternative arrangements to Euratom. Describing the notification of withdrawal as a “regrettable necessity” when article 50 is triggered, energy minister Jesse Norman said that the UK saw “clear routes” outside of Euratom to address issues such as the trade of nuclear materials. “We take this extremely seriously and are devoting serious resources [to looking at new arrangements],” he told the Lords science and technology committee on Tuesday. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said there was a “lot to be done” to put in place transitional measures replacing Euratom. “What we’re collectively warning about is the potential for there to be a very hard two-year period during which there are lots of other things the government has to deal with, that could leave it in a position where some of these things aren’t in place,” he said. Greatrex said one possible option was an associate membership of Euratom. Over the weekend, the GMB union called on ministers to reconsider their “foolhardy rush” to leave the treaty, claiming it could endanger the “UK’s entire nuclear future”. But the Office for Nuclear Regulation argued there could even be be some positives to leaving Euratom, such as a reduction in bureaucracy. “If we relinquish Euratom there would be reduced burden from not having to comply with directives,” said David Senior, an ONR executive. Norman also promised a decision was due soon on the next stage of a delayed multimillion-pound government competition for mini nuclear reactors, known as small modular reactors. “I love the projects and ideas but I want to be shown the value,” he told the peers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jul/25/dominic-cummings-no-10-nasa-control-centre-adviser-civil-service","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-25T12:00:44Z","webTitle":"Will Dominic Cummings turn No 10 into a Nasa-style control centre? | André Spicer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/dominic-cummings-no-10-nasa-control-centre-adviser-civil-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/dominic-cummings-no-10-nasa-control-centre-adviser-civil-service","fields":{"headline":"Will Dominic Cummings turn No 10 into a Nasa-style control centre?","bodyText":"Might one of Boris Johnson’s first acts as prime minister be to renovate the offices in No 10? According to his new senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, one simple way to improve the UK government is changing the spaces where decisions are made. If Cummings gets his way, out would go the polished wood tables, fireplace and ticking antique clocks. In would come banks of screens, predictive computer models and untested cognitive tools. Downing Street could look like more like a Nasa control centre than a stately home. And that’s not all he would change. Cummings has gone so far as to suggest one of his primary motivations for involving himself in Brexit was the once-in-a-half-century opportunity it would allow to fundamentally reform the British state. Over the years, he has repeatedly criticised Whitehall as achingly slow, blindly driven by the news cycle, staffed by ineffective conformists, oblivious to evidence, and out of touch with advances in technology. He thinks the civil service is staffed by “hollow men” who are incapable of thinking wisely about big problems and acting on them. So Cummings’s ideas about reforming government are bound to excite some and anger others. But to understand properly his vision of the future of government, it is best to take a sober look at his thoughts. He has some good ideas, but his vision for the future of government also has dangerous flaws. Since being the chief strategist behind Vote Leave, Cummings has withdrawn from public life to spend time reading and writing. His ideas about how to reform government can be found on his fascinating blog. In his most recent post, he outlines a range of solutions for transforming Whitehall. They include building high-performing teams, using forecasting tournaments, conducting “pre-mortems”, creating “red teams”, harnessing new data-visualisation techniques, utilising computational models and drawing on some recent thinking about mega-projects. Many of Cummings’s ideas for reform are good. His idea of running forecasting tournaments to make tough decisions is backed up by perhaps the best available recent study of forecasting out there. His suggestion of conducting pre-mortems by getting decision-makers to imagine the project they are working on has being a colossal failure is frequently used by everyone from fire-fighters to central bankers. His proposition of creating “red teams” that explicitly challenge the dominant point of view is also a great way to encourage an organisation to question its own assumptions. However many of Cummings’s ideas for civil service reform sound great on a blog but are likely to prove disastrous in practice. The first of these ideas is redesigning the space in which Whitehall decision-makers work. Cummings is keen on creating “seeing spaces” that resemble the control room of a nuclear power plant. These might look cool in an action film, but they will not be so cool in reality. Research on open-plan workspaces shows they are terrible. They make employees more stressed, less engaged, less productive, less likely to share ideas and more likely to act unethically and make bad decisions. Surrounding decision-makers with dozens of screens streaming real-time data will create a high-pressure environment where people are overloaded with information. If this happens, the quality of decisions generally deteriorates. It’s also worth remembering that a similar plan has been tried before. After Gordon Brown took over as prime minister, he visited Michael Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York. During his visit, Brown was impressed by Bloomberg’s office. The mayor sat in the middle at a control desk and was surrounded by screens and advisers. On his return to London, Brown tried to replicate Bloomberg’s control centre in No 10. I suspect that this office redesign was one of the reasons behind Brown’s downfall. It meant the introverted prime minister was constantly surrounded by people and overwhelmed by information. This made him constantly on-edge, grumpy and increasingly indecisive. The second questionable idea Cummings has for civil service reform is a wholesale change in decision-making tools. Cummings thinks the stacks of papers, red boxes and PowerPoint slides are hopelessly outdated. New tools – such as real-time computer models – are needed. These models will give decision-makers a clear understanding of complex sources of data. But there is a significant danger that key staff will start to mistake their models for reality. If this happens, they will begin to overlook information not contained in their models and ignore the assumptions which are built in. This is what happened in many financial institutions before the 2008 crisis: bankers started to believe their own models and became blind to significant risks that were not included. The third questionable idea is his reliance exclusively on tight-knit teams of highly intelligent individuals. Getting a small group of smart people to make key decisions seems reasonable. But such groups are often over-reliant on models and become disconnected from on-the-ground experiences. Furthermore, they typically make decisions with little consideration of the difficulties of implementation. One of Cummings’s touchstones for reforming the civil service is the Xerox Parc research institute during the 1970s. This invented such breakthroughs as the graphic user interface, laser printers and the ethernet. However, most of these ideas were never picked up within the company as the engineers at Parc were disconnected from the daily realities of the rest of the business. The idea that high-tech firms and hedge funds are the appropriate analogies for civil service reform is fraught with danger. Looking at Silicon Valley companies may bring in new ideas and cutting-edge practices. But it is based on a common mistake: what works in one sector will also work in another. Researchers have repeatedly found that this simply isn’t true. Cummings’s ideas about decision-making might work in sectors where processing data and pushing the right button is crucial. But in government, implementation of decisions is the crucial part. Having complex seeing-rooms staffed by super-smart people, all kitted out with the latest data-visualisation tools is unlikely to help government with the hard work of implementing its policies. • André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T09:21:39Z","webTitle":"Opposition leader makes fresh nuclear pitch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","fields":{"headline":"Opposition leader makes fresh nuclear pitch – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Enjoy your night, we’ll be back first thing tomorrow for all the latest. Here were the major developments of the day: Opposition leader Peter Dutton delivered his budget reply speech, calling Labor’s budget a “missed opportunity” while acknowledging with a small olive branch the role of the opposition wasn’t to “oppose everything”. The family and domestic violence leave bill has passed the parliament. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. The Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, ruled that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time further to criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs. Landry says Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Dutton, not her. Tony Burke has called on parliament to legislate Labor’s industrial relations bill for “secure jobs and better pay”. The Greens want it to have greater focus on women and casual workers. The Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. And the latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. And there we have it. Mike Bowers was there, and captured a moment prior to the speech when former PM Scott Morrison shook hands with Dutton. As opposition, Coalition ‘will stand against Labor’s broken promises’ He concludes his speech with a shoutout to infrastructure investment, and the Coalition’s $120bn in funding for infrastructure over the next 10 years. In contrast, this government’s first budget axed $2.8bn of infrastructure projects and further delayed $6.5bn worth of projects. Mr Speaker, we will work to restore that funding in government. He digs in at Labor for the $2.2bn commitment to a Suburban Rail Loop in Victoria to “Daniel Andrews to help with his re-election”, which he says is a blow to regional Victorians. We will work with farmers as they face difficult struggles because there was nothing for them in this budget. Labor’s intent to reduce methane emissions by 30% will drive up the cost of meat at the supermarket. It’s not only bad for farmers, but it’s just added to your grocery basket [if you eat meat]. Mr Speaker, in conclusion, Australians will recall that, prior to the election, prime minister Anthony Albanese promised that he would be a leader who wouldn’t run from responsibility. He promised to lead a government that steps up, does its job, and doesn’t always blame someone else. For all their moral posturing and for all their promises, Labor shows, time and again, that their rhetoric in opposition never matches their actions in government. You are never better off when Labor has its hands on the budget. As opposition, we will stand against Labor’s broken promises. We will have a clearly defined, positive and bold plan ahead of the next election to take our country forward. We will support hardworking Australians. We will support all Australians. And we will rebuild a stronger economy for your family and for our country. Thank you very much. Dutton also echoes the support in funding for Ukraine – a “devastating reminder” we shouldn’t take for granted peace since world war two. He says the funding is a “signal of our values” and the Coalition will “stand shoulder to shoulder” to provide more support, including announcements made today. The threat of conflict as we know in our own region is real. As many military leaders have warned, we have to be realistic about the increasing prospect of conflict. He says the AUKUS deal will give Australia the “best chance of peace” by collaborating with our “two most important allies”. I take this opportunity to thank the wonderful members of the ADF, along with first responders, local councillors, community leaders, volunteers, and many more for their efforts in supporting Australians and communities affected by the recent floods. In government, we invested a record amount in our veterans. I thank the government for continuing that investment. The number of veteran suicides in our country remains far, far too high. It is a national tragedy. And the Coalition strongly supports the government’s commitment to expand the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. Coalition supports Labor’s funding to end domestic violence Dutton praises Labor’s funding in the budget for ending domestic violence. We are all here in parliament to improve lives of Australians, especially children. He says his experience as a police officer particularly embedded this view. I saw the best and worst in society has to offer. I attended countless domestic violence incidents … the Coalition will invest significantly in these family support services and also to protect women and children from sexual assault. On to jobs. Dutton says Labor has “no plan” to save predicted job losses in the coming four years. Across the economy employers are crying out for workers – in June, the Coalition announced a policy to double the age and veteran service pension from $300 to $600 per fortnight … to allow older Australians and veterans to work more if they choose to do so without losing their pension payments … Labor’s policy is about 25% less than the Coalition’s proposal, and right now, we need more incentive in the system to get people more into work. He says Labor’s budget will “empower unions” and be a “throwback to the 1980s”. Labor’s changes will impose industry-wide one size fits all conditions … the last time they used strikes to pursue sector wide ultimatums, was in 1982. And in that year, unemployment reached 9.4%, inflation 12.4% and 2m working days were lost in industrial disputation. Labor housing promise a ‘Kevin Rudd design’ with no detail Dutton says the Coalition would help first home buyers to access their super for the “super homebuyer support” plan, announced during the election campaign. Currently, a superfund can be used to buy residential or commercial rental property, to buy shares or even livestock … except a home to live in … with $100,000 from super, the first home buyers wouldn’t have been able to afford their home. With access to super, they have a home to live in. If the house was sold after a decade, the $100,000 will be worth around $214,000. And if that was reinvested back, as would require, the couple would end up with a balance from that amount in the super when they retire of over $1 million. Under the Coalition government, we will extend the same option to women … with very few housing options and those who are increasingly left homeless. The Coalition has a strong record when it comes to getting first-time buyers and second parent families into their first homes. We support initiatives to increase the supply of housing but the government initiative has no detail. The Labor government has promised 1m additional homes in five years costing $10bn. Now, does anyone believe that? It’s a Kevin Rudd design. Dutton turns to family. He says his teenage boys are in their exams period in Brisbane and his wife is there “making sure they are studying and not watching television”. But I wanted to mention my parents, they are both unwell, unable to travel down but my dad was a bricklayer, my mum was a secretary … my parents had a very strong work ethic, the taught us to appreciate the value of money. We had a lot of support and love and not much money. It was a time when Labor was residing with high interest rates and unemployment. And it was a terrible time for the building industry. I was encouraged to get a part-time job as many kids in my generation [were] … From grade seven, I worked in a butcher shop after school and on Saturday mornings, scrubbing floors and washing up and serving on the counter. It was tough work but it was character building and gave me an appreciation for many different perspectives. I saved like crazy, one of my proudest achievements was buying my first home. It was nothing flashy and less than $90,000 from memory but it was mine. And today it is much higher. Dutton accuses Labor of planning to scrap stage-three tax cuts Back to tax. Dutton says “cost-of-living relief is interconnected with tax relief”. In a bit of a Thatcher throwback: You should keep more of what you own, hard-working Australia should be rewarded and the best reward is lower taxes. He touts the stage three-tax cuts, which will “lower tax for more than 10 million Australians” and “simplify our tax system”. Our plan means that the top 5% of income earners will pay 33% more income tax, you can work hard, take an extra shift or get a pay rise … without suddenly being pushed into a high tax bracket. Stage-three tax relief comes into effect on July of 2024 and … after interest rate rises, that’s when our economy will need it most. That’s when Australians especially deserve it. He says Labor has “laid the groundwork” to break their commitment to the tax cuts. The budget is intended to soften up Australia, gives the government time, with more excuses by May of next year, to tax more. Australia must follow US, UK and others on nuclear energy Now Dutton turns to nuclear energy. He says Labor is “misleading Australians” when it says it can “run out billions of dollars worth of transmission wires, cables and towers for renewable energies in just the next few years”. Regional communities … will be carpeted with up to 28,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines. Almost the entire coastline of mainland Australia or the distance of travelling from Melbourne to Perth four times. Every dollar spent will be paid for by consumers through higher electricity bills. He says Canada, France, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US are all investing in “next-generation zero emissions nuclear small modular reactors to shore up energy security” and reach targets. The imperative to create affordable, reliable and emission free energy by the Coalition is seeking an intelligent conversation on the role of these new-age nuclear technologies. Investing in renewables is ‘crucial’ but Labor is phasing out fossil fuels too soon, Dutton says Dutton says investing in renewable energy and reducing emissions to protect the environment is “crucial” – quite a change of pace from the bring a bit of coal to work days. “We want a sustainable and sensible pathway to reduce our emissions,” he says, but “the technology does not exist” at the scale currently needed to rely on renewable energy at night or during peak periods. It is just the scientific reality. [We need to] use coal and gas, hydro, hydrogen, nuclear or battery as the energy source … when renewables are not fitting the system but Labor is going to phase out coal and gas before the new technology is being rolled out. In this budget the government makes it harder for more gas supply at a time when we need it most. On Tuesday night we saw the government rip up funding for gas exploration and cancel gas infrastructure projects which will eliminate shortfalls and make your bills cheaper. They handed over funding to environmental activists who want to overturn gas project approvals … a push for 82% renewables comes without a plan. Dutton continues to languish in the past for awhile. He says Australia “emerged as the envy of most nations” from Covid-19 in terms of its economic position. When you hear Labor carry on about a wasted decade, it is a distraction from the fact this government has no economic plan. And Labor will continue to misrepresent the truth until the next election to mask their bad decisions, most notably upon energy policy. He says six months ago the prime minister promised electricity bills would go down under his government, by $275. In this budget, instead of going down as promised, Labor’s plan was the electricity bills go up by more than 56% over the next two years [this wasn’t their plan as much as modelling]. Not only that, of course, but your gas bill will go up by more than 44%. Pensioners cannot afford that level of increase, and not just pensioners, self-funded retirees, families and small businesses as well, in fact, most Australians. In Europe we are hearing about people having to choose between paying their power bills or putting food on the table. Between heating or eating, this winter. Their electricity and gas bills are spiralling out of control … and despite those warnings and lessons, this government is following in the footsteps. Dutton: ‘We did not get everything right … but we kept the nation afloat’ Dutton lays out the Coalition’s priorities and where he says the budget has failed – energy policy, tax relief, housing, job shortages, industrial relations and infrastructure in the regions. He says the budget shows “yet again” that Labor “cannot manage the economy when it forms government” – a line that has been repeated by the Coalition for decades. Dutton contends there’s a “historical pattern” of Labor “creating a mess and the Coalition cleaning it up”, pointing to Howard after Keating, Abbott after Rudd/Gillard and the “back in black” 2019 budget … prior to Covid-19, and the biggest economic downturn since the great depression. It was only due to our economic management over the seven years prior to the pandemic that we were in a strong position to implement a suite of support measures. With 2020 hindsight we did not get everything right and some of the state lockdowns went on for far too long … but under our policies, we kept the nation afloat. Dutton says the prime minister has “broken his faith” with the public by admissions in the budget papers that by Christmas, a typical family would be $2,000 worse off. He admits this is amid war in Ukraine and surging power prices globally. Under the Labor budget, electricity prices are set to rise by more than 56% and gas prices by more than 44%. And we note that at these difficult times, nations around the world are contending with economic challenges born from the pandemic and amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but thanks to the Coalition … the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. Cost of living is going up partly due to global conditions but also due to this Labor government’s decision. The treasurer said this government makes hard decisions for hard times but I say it makes … hard times even harder for all Australians. Whether you are young, raising a family or retired, whether you’re an employee or running a business, on Tuesday, the treasurer failed to mention in his speech what Labor’s paper revealed, everything is going up except your wages. Cost of living, power prices, taxes, interest rates, unemployment and the deficit are going up or will be going up under the government’s predictions … you have every right to be anxious and disappointed. Coalition does not oppose everything in the budget Dutton says the Coalition doesn’t oppose everything in the budget, nor is that the job of the opposition. He says the Coalition supports the childcare subsidy, investment into medicine, combatting domestic violence and funding towards flood recover. We do not disagree with everything in this budget and policy must be judged on its merits – if it is good for you, we will support it … there were several good measures in the budget. The extension of the childcare subsidy to more Australian families, the commitment to reduce the price of medicine. The initiative to combat domestic violence and the funding to help Australians recover from devastating floods. Labor budget ‘weakens Australia’s financial position’, Dutton says Dutton says the budget didn’t address economic challenges Australians are facing to “inspire confidence”. It is a budget that weakens Australia’s financial position rather than strengthens it and it adds to rather than alleviates cost of living pressures. Then he’s straight to anecdotes. “Kel” runs a multigenerational IGA supermarket in Queensland. He negotiated a commercial and industrial energy contract when the Coalition was in government and power prices were much lower than they are now. Today, his business is threatened as he faces an increase of $160,000 on the power bill from last year alone. The energy costs will go up further. A friendly reminder the Coalition were in government until the end of May. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is up. He starts his speech praising the nation, calling the budget a “missed opportunity” to help Australians at a time of uncertainty. We live in the best country in the world but for millions of Australians things are not easy now, [we are] facing increasing financial pressures, mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling up at the petrol station. Cost of living is skyrocketing and may soon be out of control yet it can be kept in check. But not while this Labor government makes bad economic decisions. A reminder, we will be hearing from the leader of the opposition Peter Dutton at 7.30 tonight as he gives his budget reply. We’ll keep the live blog open for the duration of the speech. Landry says not the first time Albanese has ‘treated me with disrespect’ Michelle Landry has issued a statement following criticisms regarding the conduct of the prime minister during Question Time today. Speaker of the house and Labor MP, Milton Dick, has ruled that Anthony Albanese was not disrespectful in an answer to Landry this afternoon, saying he was directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. Landry sees it differently. She says she was “yelled at and screamed at” across the chamber and felt “intimidated and bullied”. I respectfully ask the prime minister to publicly apologise to me in the House of Representatives. Albanese speaks to new UK PM Anthony Albanese has congratulated the UK’s new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on his new role. If all goes to plan in UK politics, they will hold their first bilateral meeting next month, at the G20 in India. Severe weather warning for Victoria’s southern alps Damaging winds averaging 60 to 70 km/h with peak gusts to 100 km/h are possible over Alpine areas in Mt Baw Baw on Friday afternoon. Further to the criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs, the Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, has now ruled quickly that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time earlier. Dick, also a Labor MP, told the house just before the chamber adjourned for the day: I have reviewed the footage and I can confirm that the prime minister was answering the question from the member for Capricornia. During the answer, the prime minister was also directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. In reviewing the footage, I did not see the prime minister show any disrespect to the member for Capricornia. As the footage was not on the member for Capricornia for the entire response, I did not see her leave the chamber. Of the Capricornia that I was able to review, she appeared engaged in the response to the prime minister. Landry, along with the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, and other MPs have demanded Albanese apologise. Landry said the PM called her to say he didn’t mean to upset her. We’ve contacted Albanese’s office for response, and his side of the phone call. Meanwhile, Canberra’s own David Pocock has been up and about today: Fossil fuels 90% responsible for energy crisis – report The Climate Council has responded to a new global report which has found fossil fuels are 90% responsible for the energy crisis. The IEA’s 2022 World Energy Outlook, released today, found gas alone was 50% to blame for energy prices increasing. Former Origin Energy executive Andrew Stock, now a councillor with the Climate Council, said this week’s federal budget “spelled grim news for Australians already feeling the pinch”: The IEA report has made it abundantly clear that fossil fuels are the root cause of this problem, particularly gas, which is the most expensive form of power in Australia. This global report points to an obvious, affordable solution - a rapid transition to renewable energy. Which would be a win for households, businesses, jobs and the climate. Solar and wind are the cheapest sources of power globally, and are already outcompeting fossil fuels. The report highlights the forecast increase in total global energy demand to 2030 will be met almost entirely by renewables. The message for Australia is clear. After a wasted decade, we are now on the right track, but have tremendous ground to make up. The Climate Council says based on Australia’s high emissions, economic strength and untapped opportunities for renewable energy, it should be aiming to reduce its emissions to 75% below 2005 levels by 2030. As expected the Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. The purchases of mostly federal (but some state) debt helped lower the borrowing costs for the then Morrison government (which also splurged $300bn-plus to keep the economy afloat). All up, the RBA more than tripled the size of its balance sheet to about $650bn when its special bond purchasing program stopped. Anyway, with interest rates rising, it had to reflect the lower market value of all that debt. For the domestic bonds alone, the unrealised valuation losses were $40.3bn. The overall accounting loss for the year was $36.7bn, a record with sunshine second. Equity also dropped to negative $12.4bn. But as the RBA report said: This negative equity position does not affect the Bank’s operations or its ability to operate effectively or perform its policy functions. The Board expects that the Bank’s capital will be restored over time due to positive underlying earnings and capital gains when bonds mature. What’s the take away? Treasury should not expect any dividends from the RBA for a long time. Also of interest, so to speak: Governor Phil Lowe’s total compensation dropped about 3.6% from the previous year, to a tad under $1.037m, or about $20,000 a week. Helen Haines welcomes announcement of single-site hospital for Albury-Wodonga Member for Indi Helen Haines has welcomed the announcement that Albury Wodonga Health will be redeveloped into an expanded single-site hospital. If you missed it earlier, the NSW and Victorian premiers fronted the media to announce a joint plan to overhaul Albury base hospital with a $558m redevelopment. Haines said she had made the case for a new hospital to the prime minister in their first conversation after the election. Doctors, health professionals, patients and the wider community have been campaigning for a new hospital for years and I have proudly stood beside them … this announcement is reward for our advocacy, the result of constantly fighting for our healthcare to be taken seriously by every level of government. This re-developed single-site hospital will benefit people all over North Eastern Victoria and Southern NSW – more care will be available close to home without having to travel to Melbourne. We will no longer face situations where some services are offered at one site, and other services on the other side of the border. Patients won’t wait hours to be transferred, or for specialists to travel from one hospital to another. This will lead to better health outcomes and be safer for patients.” But Haines argued it still falls short of what many in the community had lobbied for and wasn’t “the end of the fight on our health care”, with more needed to improve funding in regional and rural areas. She will be appearing in Wodonga tomorrow afternoon to hold a press conference. Greens call for Labor to put ‘women and carers first’ in proposed industrial relations bill The Greens have called for Labor’s proposed changes to industrial law to put “women and carers first” and lift wages of the low paid following workplace relations minister Tony Burke’s introduction of the bill to the house today. The party is aware its vote will be key to the industrial relations bill passing through the Senate. Senator Barbara Pocock, Greens spokesperson for employment, said evidence from submissions before the select committee on work and care showed 5 million people were trying to balance work with caring responsibilities. We need to move from the Hunger Games to roster justice, and decent work. That means adequate notice of shift changes, negotiation, minimum hours. Our major supermarkets can predict the kinds and quantities of apples they will buy tomorrow, but apparently can’t tell their workers what shifts they’re working. Being unable to plan your life or see your kids is hugely stressful. Many workers withdraw from the labour market because it’s impossible to juggle taking care of the kids and keep working. Australian workers, especially women, have waited decades for flexibility that actually works for them. They’ve waited for justice in their rosters, rosters and predictability of their working time. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the party had argued for a long time that industrial relations in Australia was broken. Pressure on workers has been growing for too long, wages have been too low, and people haven’t been able to bargain for better pay and conditions. Labor needs the support of the Greens to pass this bill. The Greens want industrial relations laws that work for women, work for carers and lift the wages of the lowest paid. That’s what we’ll be looking for as we work our way through this bill. Read about the bill here: The Bureau of Meteorology has released its climate outlook for the November to January period. Not great, but unsurprising news for some – rainfall is likely to remain above average for most of eastern Australia, particularly in the month of November. La Niña, a negative Indian Ocean dipole, an expected positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode and warmer waters around Australia are contributing to the wetter conditions. The BoM: For the fortnight 31 October to 13 November, above median rainfall is likely for most of eastern Australia. This increases to very likely for north-east and far south-east parts of the mainland. Below median rainfall is likely for large parts of Western Australia extending into the western Northern Territory. Maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of north-west Australia and Tasmania. Below median temperatures are likely for southern Queensland, and most of New South Wales and Victoria. Minimum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of the northern halves of Queensland and the Northern Territory, and south-eastern Australia. Many thanks to Amy Remeikis for keeping us informed on a mammoth day, during a mammoth week. We’ll be keeping the blog open a little longer tonight to catch the opposition leader’s budget reply speech. And on that note, I will hand you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through the evening. That’s it from me until the house sits again on 7 November – which is also when we will get budget estimates. Huzzah. In the meantime, thank you for joining me this budget week – you have all helped us get through it. Please – take care of you. Michelle Landry speaks here: Michelle Landry says Anthony Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Peter Dutton, not her. The latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. Medibank reported on Thursday afternoon that it had become clear overnight that the attacker had accessed patient information associated with the program that Medibank runs with Calvary on behalf of Wellbeing SA and the South Australian government. The insurer says the data accessed includes personal information and some health data. The My Home Hospital program provides services such as doctor visits, X-rays, blood tests, medication and meals in the home. Medibank said it has begun directly contacting the 4,400 affected patients, and that it had determined the data has been accessed, but did not know whether the data was taken from Medibank systems. Patients admitted on or after 13 October aren’t affected, Medibank said. Medibank has established a dedicated phone support service for My Home Hospital patients (My Home Hospital Cyber Response 1800 081 245). Josh Butler and Mike Bowers are at Sussan Ley and Michelle Landry’s press conference. We will bring you what they said very soon. (It is not being broadcast.) This was the beginning of Anthony Albanese’s answer to Michelle Landry’s question. You can hear Peter Dutton ask “where’s Yeppen?” Sussan Ley will hold a press conference in about 15 minutes. This is the subject line: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Capricornia and Coalition women will hold a press conference in the Opposition Courtyard of Parliament House in Canberra. Troubled air traffic management project to face increased scrutiny A new air traffic management system has been placed on the federal government’s defence project watchlist after delays and cost blowouts. The troubled project is called the Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System. It will replace the air traffic control systems at 12 Australian Defence Force (ADF) base locations with a new system that also covers non-military air traffic. Under the plans, Defence and Airservices Australia aim “to harmonise Australia’s civil and military air traffic management systems”. There should be “increased cooperation and collaboration between Airservices and Defence”, according to the project summary. But the minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, announced this afternoon that the government had added it to Defence’s Projects of Concern list, a move that triggers increased scrutiny to try to fix problems: The Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System project has been listed as a Project of Concern because of significant schedule, technical and cost challenges ... The project has seen a two-year delay to forecast Initial and Final Operational Capability in the past two years. It is my expectation that this listing brings more high-level attention, resources and energy – from both Defence and our industry partner Thales Australia – to the task of remediating this project. It is not the first time this project has been listed as a Project of Concern. The Coalition listed it as such in August 2017, but a contract was signed the following year and was moved to the less-serious “Project of Interest” list. Michelle Landry leaves the chamber Michelle Landry left the chamber after Anthony Albanese’s answer to her question. I wasn’t in the chamber, so only saw the broadcast – and Albanese, when he was all agitated and yelling about the difference between Rockhampton (which Landry had asked about) and Yeppoon (which seemed to come as an interjection from Peter Dutton) didn’t address that part to Landry. But her position in the chamber, just to the side and back of Dutton, may have made it seemed like he was. The rest of the answer – about how the government would fund the project the Coalition was unable to (eventually it seems, the funding has been delayed) appeared to be addressed to the opposition at large. But at the same time, parliament seems to be the only place where yelling in the workplace is part of the culture. Opposition supports government’s announcement of more assistance for Ukraine Andrew Hastie has responded to the news Australian troops will be helping to train Ukrainian troops in Europe: The Coalition welcomes the Government’s announcement of further support to Ukraine, including an additional 30 Bushmasters to bolster efforts on the ground and the deployment of 70 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to help train Ukrainian reservists in the UK. For some weeks now, Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko has been calling for additional assistance from Australia and we are pleased to see those calls being answered. The ADF is among the most highly regarded armed forces in the world and we expect the 70 personnel being deployed to the UK will serve our country with distinction as they always do. It is a critical time for the Ukrainian government and people, who have defended their country with lion-hearts. They’ve won significant battlefield victories lately, and they are counting on our support to build on their gains. This assistance builds on the more than $285 million in military and humanitarian assistance delivered under the former Coalition government – including the original contribution of M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs), Bushmaster vehicles, M777 towed howitzers and ammunition, as well as anti-armour weapons and other weapons. Australia staunchly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty as we continue to call on Russia to cease their unprovoked, unjust, and illegal war. The Opposition supports the Government identifying ongoing assistance to Ukraine and welcomes the opportunity to receive full details about this announcement in the near future. Question time chats as captured by Mike Bowers: Anthony Albanese was quite shouty today. And question time, finally, finally ends. Sussan Ley wants the Speaker to review “the tone” of Anthony Albanese’s response to the question from Michelle Landry. Ley says Landry “left the chamber in tears” and wants a review of the footage. Milton Dick said he will review the footage and report back. Question time is still going because this week will never end and we are all living in the worst timeline. There won’t be the usual rush to the airport after this either, as the budget reply speech means that the MPs have to all hang around. Anthony Albanese, from NSW, just out-Queenslanded Queenslander Peter Dutton. Michelle Landry asked this question (she is the member for Capricornia, in Queensland). The federal government is intending to delay $800 million of commonwealth funding to construct the Rockhampton Ring Road by at least two years. (The rest of the question is about whether Anthony Albanese is breaking his promise to the people of Capricornia.) Anthony Albanese starts speaking about Rockhampton flood plains projects and the Yeppen lagoon, and then Peter Dutton interjects with something about Yeppoon, which is most definitely not in Rockhampton. Albanese: Yeppoon is a different place! Yeppoon is a different place, and you might want to ask the member for Capricornia, because Yeppoon is on the coast, north of Rockhampton and Yeppen floodplain is to the south. It’s the southern entry of the Bruce Highway into Rockhampton! Queenslander! It says it all! It says it all! He goes on with a bit of spring in his step about how Labor will get the project done. The member for Longman, Terry Young, has a question for Chris Bowen: I refer to an answer earlier this week on RGS, a manufacturer of my electorate that uses over 200 megawatt-hours per year [that experienced an] increase of about $40,000 in power bills. The default market offer to which the minister referred in his answer is only available to small businesses that consume 100 mega kilowatt hours. The minister did not answer my question. I ask again, [on] the prices facing this and many other businesses … what is the government doing about it? Bowen: Thank you very much. I thank the honourable member for his question. My concern goes to all businesses in Queensland and across the country. It also goes to all households across Australia and their energy bills, because we want to work and we are working and we will work to ensure that our prices are as well as possible. … In the budget we had a choice. We could have penned the pressures on power prices, option A, that the previous government took. We could have hit that, or option B is to be upfront with the Australian people about the pressures. That’s the option we took. That’s the option we took, we have the option of being honest to the Australian people. And that is where Angus Taylor gets booted out, given his interjections ramp up. Bowen: It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us. We are concerned and upfront in relation to Queensland small businesses, small or large or medium, we should care about them all. The increase in small-business prices was 12.8%, $705 and I make no apologies appointed out of the house and the Australian people. Paul Fletcher: This repeated claim of hiding … the standing orders are very clear. All imputations of improper motives to a member shall be considered highly disorderly. It is clearly what this minister is repeatedly doing, and I ... Chris Bowen: Certainly. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact is … the previous minister hid the facts and he should be ashamed of himself. Angus Taylor has been booted from the chamber under 94A. “It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us,” Chris Bowen says. Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus. Amanda Rishworth takes a dixer just to remind everyone the Coalition called mothers “double dippers” on the paid parental leave payment (when they were legally taking what their work offered and topping it up with the government plan, as was intended) on Mothers’ Day. Good times. (Also a reminder that paid parental leave and increasing the childcare subsidy doesn’t make it a “family” budget. Your family can look any way you want it to, and it doesn’t have to involve children – and that is before we get to the people who have older children who don’t use the subsidy any longer.) The member for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, seems to have practised delivering this question a few times. We love a fresh delivery. Get those toastmaster points! McIntosh: In the lead-up to the 2022 election, and since, the government has repeatedly cited modelling forecasting that wholesale and residential electricity prices would decrease by 18% but the government’s budget tells us that Australians can expect increases in electricity, gas prices of 50% and 40% respectively. Will the prime minister now admit that the modelling Labor stood by was flawed and so too are the government’s energy policies that relied on that modelling? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. Indeed, we did release modelling done by RepuTex in 2021. After that occurred, of course, there was not modelling but in fact, a factual change that occurred in May 2022 from the Australian Energy Regulator that pointed to a 20% increase in costs of electricity, and that flowed through to wholesale prices. Of course, there are a couple of pressures on energy prices. One, of course, is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the second ... (interjections, etc) … What I was asked about occurred in 2021. If you go back to when the Russian invasion of Ukraine was, I think you’ll find out, because I remember, because you should recall President Zelensky spoke just before my last budget reply in March of this year to this chamber. The second pressure, of course, is the failure to invest, the fact that four gigs went out and one gig of energy went in. … That led to a massive failure to invest. Three years ago, before the 2019 election, of course, there was a promise of a billion dollars towards new generation, a billion dollars. That would have added to 3,800 megawatts of new generation. So that would have meant instead of four out one in, that would have been 4.8 out - in and four in. (there is about 10 seconds of interjections and calls for order) … Three years later not a single dollar of that was delivered. Not a dollar, … not any megawatts, they aimed for 3,800, they delivered zero, zero, zero, a big duck egg. Not one watt of new generation as a result of that announcement. Of course that’s before we go to the farcical situation of the Collinsville promise that was never delivered either. And he’s out of time. Catherine King ‘rejects entirely’ idea that Darwin investment for gas-based manufacturing is subsidy for fossil fuels Dr Monique Ryan has another of the crossbench questions (and this is what Stephen Bates was getting at) My question is for the minister for infrastructure and regional development. In this week’s budget, your government allocated $1.5 billion for the Middle Arm industrial zone in Darwin Harbour. Middle Arm proposes Perth chemical manufacturing using gas from the Beetaloo Basin. Unless that changes, this is a subsidy for the fossil fuel industries. Will you guarantee the Middle Arm precinct will not produce petrochemicals or gas-based manufacturing? Catherine King: Thanks very much to the member for Kooyong for your question. Well, the Australian government invests in projects such as the Middle Arm precinct in an important way of setting up our economy for a sustainable future. Instead of funding any particular companies or particular industries, we’re actually investing in common use enabling infrastructure. We do that across industrial precincts across the country to give all potential users in the market the opportunity to grow and thrive. This includes those able to process and export green hydrogen and energy transition components made locally. The government is providing in the budget $1.9 billion in planned equity to support the development of Middle Arm, together with regional logistic hubs in the Northern Territory across those key transport links. That’s what we’re doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive, to be sustainable, with a focus, I recognise that the - I can hear some interjections from the member for New England about that. He likes this - I know he likes this particular project, which I’m very happy about. (Interjections) … No, no, I was, I was actually acknowledging that that’s what he was doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive and sustainable but it will focus on low emission hydro-carbons, green hydrogen and critical minerals processing. Demand we know ... Ryan gets up and she is not happy with what she has been hearing: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was hoping for an answer to my question. Spicy! But not a point of order. Still, nice to see another new member of the crossbench settling in to the rhythm of the place. King: As we know, the demand is growing for clean energy sources and Labor’s investment will help position the Northern Territory and Northern Australia to actually diversify their economy and to create jobs. This investment is not a subsidy for fossil fuels. I reject that entirely. Rather funding will go towards the infrastructure that will support users to export clean energy, critical to meet our commitment to net zero. Like green hydrogen and lithium batteries that are critical, critical, to decarbonisation, common user infrastructure at Middle Arm and industrial precincts across the country which the commonwealth regularly invests is included in Infrastructure Australia’s infrastructure priority list of nationally significant proposals and the project is currently at the stage 2 assessment process. The Middle Arm precinct is undergoing significant environmental assessments under the Northern Territory Environment Protection Act and the federal Environmental protection and biodiversity Act. These assessments will understand the impact of the proposed construction in the Northern Territory has completed and commenced over 200 investigations including feasibility studies into land and marine development and environmental culture and heritage. This is good for the Territory. It’s good for the nation. And I reject absolutely it being a fossil fuel subsidy. David Littleproud is back! My question is again to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new poles and wires under the government’s energy policy. Chris Bowen: Again, Mr Speaker, this is the new culture war from the leader of the National party and I wish him well on it. If this is the hill he chooses to die on, Mr Speaker, that’s a matter for him. Because he’s referring to the green hydrogen superpower option under the ISP which was released while they were in office. Which was released while they were the government, Mr Speaker. It’s actually a document which had bipartisan support, Mr Speaker. … He refers to the government’s 28,000km of transmission lines. In fact, we’re implementing – seeking to implement the ISP step change model. He’s talking about something completely fraudulent, Mr Speaker. And also we are getting on with the job of better consultation because what really matters is route selection. Route selection, there are options to where the routes go. They can go on public land, they can after appropriate community consultation and appropriate conversation go with private land. So I guess could a nuclear power plant which the leader of the National Parties seems so addicted to. It is back to David Littleproud’s poles and wires question – this is something he has been asking about for the last couple of days: My question is to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new polls and wires under government’s energy policy? Angus Taylor has a lot to say as Chris Bowen comes up to the despatch box. Bowen: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. The leader of the National Party refers to the ISP, the integrated systems plan, the 28,000km figure refers to the green jersey superpower scenario. 10,000km is a step change. The Government is getting on with implementing the ISP through the rewiring the nation policy. Just tomorrow, the nation’s Energy Ministers will meet and review progress in reforming the regulatory process of transmission to improve community consultation and compensation - a process started by this Government. Not started by the previous Government because we want to ensure communities are consulted properly. Littleproud: Relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was very tight. It asks for a specific number of properties that will be impacted by the 28,000km of poles and wires. Milton Dick: Thank you for that. The minister is in order. He’s been going for 40 ... There are interjections from Littleproud, and Dick continues: If you let me finish, leader of the Nationals. He’s been going for 40 seconds. There was a specific question in there regarding a number and I will ask the minister to return when he’s ready to that part of the question and I give him the call. Bowen: Thank you, Mr Speaker. And the leader of the National party asked me about the 28,000km which is the green hydrogen superpower scenario and 28,000km under that scenario, which was prepared under the previous Government. Mr Speaker, as I said, energy ministers tomorrow are reviewing the progress in reforming the RET. We’re hearing from the renewable energy commissioner, a federal government appointee, who has been working with the New South Wales state government and doing excellent work, Mr Speaker, just this week. They announced a new compensation regime for people impacted. Now the leader of the National party is very concerned about social licence. I welcome his interest. I welcome his interest in the social licence ... The interjections go up to 11 so Dick has to step in again: You may resume your seat. Order. When the House comes to order, I’ll ask the minister to address that part of the question. He’s still got 1.5 minutes to go. I’m listening ... listening carefully to his answer. He has three minutes to answer the question. There is no time constraint about when he has to answer. I’m listening quite carefully. The Leader of the House. Tony Burke: Just to raise a point of order. There’s the normal rule about a point of order on direct relevance only being able to be taken once. The opposition having already raised that have now decided from the interjections to not be shouting at the government but in fact to be shouting at you and about your ruling and I just want to draw your attention to it and in my role as Leader of the House, just... (There are more interjections) Burke: Your can interject on me all you want, but you don’t do it to the Speaker. Dick: Order. Members on my left [the opposition] – members on my left will cease interjecting. I’ll ask the minister to return to that part of the question and I told the House I’m listening carefully to the answer. The minister may continue. Bowen finishes with: We’ll continue to work with the renewable energy commissioner, with my states and territories colleagues, and continue to oppose your plans to put nuclear reactors right across Australia which doesn’t have community support or licence. Opposition’s strategy was to arm Australian defence ‘with press releases’, defence minister says Richard Marles takes a dixer (a question the government has written itself) on defence procurement, so he can reprosecute some old numbers, but with some new hoo-hah: In coming to office, the Albanese Labor government has inherited a defence procurement mess. When those opposite were in power, there were 28 different programs that were running a total of 97 years over time. Hunter class frigates four years late - $50 billion over budget. The Spartan battle field aircraft, 4.5 years late, offshore patrol vessels a year late, Cape class patrol vessels another year late, that’s before we even start talking about submarines. When it came to defence announcements, those opposite were best in class. Vaudeville, Hoopla, we saw Top Gun music, all showtime. It was as if they were trying to tap-dance our adversaries into submission ... Their strategy was to have Australia walk on to the battlefield armed with press releases. But when it comes to actually delivering capability, getting the hard power equation right, those opposite were the single worst defence procurement government in our nation’s history, and not least because they, themselves, were a picture of chaos. In nine years we had six, really seven different defence ministers, the last of whom is sitting right there as the leader of the opposition. All of this at a time when we are facing the most precarious strategic circumstances since the second world war. Under those opposite, Australia’s lost decade could not have come at a more damaging historic moment. Big and medium-sized businesses support budget, Albanese says It’s time for Angus Taylor to ask about the cost of living which is one of the things in question time Jim Chalmers and half of the Labor bench seem to live for. Taylor: My question is to the prime minister. The budget confirms that a typical family will be $2,000 worse off by Christmas with inflation, interest rates and unemployment all forecast to go up. Given this increasing pressure on the cost of living, what specific action is the government taking to fast-track new natural gas projects and when can Australians expect to see relief? Anthony Albanese: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the shadow treasurer for his question. Of course, they had a shadow treasurer even when they had a treasurer. But we have one treasurer and he’s done a fantastic job. And the budget has been well received by people who are economically literate. … This is what Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council had to say: ‘Amid global economic turmoil, this budget steadies the ship and sets the groundwork for reform to drive economic growth in the May budget. This is a cautious and careful budget that avoids making our inflation problem worse. ‘This is a crucial first step to restoring our budget position and building our national resilience. We welcome investments to boost productivity and participation through skills, education, child care and expanding paid parental leave. We strongly support the Government’s comprehensive skills package and migration announcement.’ … But the ACCI said this, and Drew Mackellar said this: ‘Tonight’s budget is a responsible one. This budget covers the essential elements of economic management and tackling growing cost pressures. ‘As the budget warns, we cannot afford to be complacent against a global headwinds of severe inflation, climbing interest rates and soaring energy prices. Through the Powering Australia plan and funding for new energy infrastructure, the budget finds significant investment to underpin the transition to a net zero future that supports new opportunity for industry.’ So we have big business supporting the budget. We have medium-sized business supporting the budget. (There are a bunch of interjections and I miss the middle part of the answer.) This is what the Master Builders had to say, again, apparently an affiliate of the Labor party: ‘The 2022 housing accord is a welcome signal to the building and construction industry who have been crying out for action to address housing affordability barriers and supply constraints.’ I have got more, Mr Speaker, but I’ll wait for the next question for the further endorsements done by people who used to be their allies, who they now ridicule. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on how Labor supports women. Moving on. Not sure if some in the opposition needed a trigger warning, because Greens MP Stephen Bates has one of the crossbench questions and he is still not wearing a tie*. I’m sure one of the clerks has the smelling salts ready just in case. Bates: my question is to the minister for industry, science and resources. Why does the budget contain more than $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies including $30 million to frack for gas in the Beetaloo Basin and almost $2 billion to fund a gas export terminal in Darwin Harbour when we are in the middle of a climate emergency? Ed Husic seems happy to get a call up, but he doesn’t have much of an answer for Bates. But he, in what has become his way in his dealings with the crossbench, keeps it very civil and polite. Thank you very much, Speaker, and thank you to the member for the question. A lot of that is not directed necessarily in my own portfolio and relates to other areas, but we’re happy to take it on notice and we’ll get back to you with some response. *we approve of the no tie, btw. Blame for state of energy markets ‘rests squarely with Vladimir Putin’, treasurer says Jim Chalmers gets a dixer just to give Peter Dutton a sledge ahead of his budget reply speech: We’re told today that the leader of the opposition in his speech tonight about the appropriations wants to talk about the [previous] government’s economic record. And this is his opportunity – he takes very seriously his responsibility as the leader of the leftovers, Mr Speaker, and in doing he has a rolled gold opportunity tonight to fess up for the Coalition record on the economy – and let’s consider it for a moment. Their record on the economy is skills shortages holding the economy back. It’s stagnant wages for a decade. It’s weak productivity and business investment. It’s an aged care crisis, it’s a trillion dollars in debt with nowhere near enough to show for it and it’s this energy policy chaos which is making us more vulnerable to global energy shocks. Mr Speaker, what we’re seeing in our energy markets right now, the blame for that, rests squarely with Vladimir Putin. Albanese: Business and ‘more enlightened members of the Liberal party’ both recognise renewables are cheaper And after Mark Butler has some fun in a dixer about how terrible he thought his predecessor was, we move to another groundhog day moment when Sussan Ley, who is still trying to work out how she plays her role as shadow minister for government attacks, asks: My question is to the prime minister. Yesterday, the treasurer finally confirmed that the Labor party misled the Australian people 97 times before the last election on their promise to reduce power bills by $275 when he admitted it wasn’t in the budget after saying it was. Given the treasurer has now apologised to one Australian over this – Charles Croucher from Nine News – when will the other 26 million Australians get their apology? And the chamber is in uproar. Anthony Albanese: Mr Speaker, I thank the deputy leader for her question. I reject the premise of the question. Because it goes to a failure for those opposite to actually recognise that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new energy. Yesterday I spoke about the deal that was done with the Tasmanian government and what they have to say, what the Victorian government have to say as well, and I spoke about what the New South Wales premier had to say. But I agree with the statement that the cheapest, most reliable and cleanest energy on the planet are renewables. I agree with the member for Barker. I agree the cheapest way to deliver electricity today is not coal, it’s not gas, it’s certainly not nuclear; it’s wind, solar, backed up by pumped hydro and batteries. So if you care about cheap energy and reliable energy, then you’re looking at wind, solar and pumped hydro. Now, they’re not my statements, Mr Speaker. They’re the statements of Matt Kean, the New South Wales treasurer, the deputy leader of this deputy leader’s party in New South Wales. Ley pretends she has a point of order: A point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. Why can’t the Prime Minister say $275 ... Milton Dick is not having it: Resume your seat. I was pretty clear yesterday about that abuse of standing order. The deputy leader has special privileges which she’s taken advantage of. I just remind all members to state the point of order of relevance. I will take the point but if it continues I will not take them anymore. I give the call to the prime minister. Albanese: Thanks. But it’s not just more enlightened members of the Liberal party who recognise that the earth is round and renewables are the cheapest form of new energy. It’s also the business community. It’s what Jennifer Westacott said … Jennifer said this: ‘You’ll also be paying less for your power because at the moment, building new renewables is cheaper than building new coal and cheaper electricity will continue to drive down energy prices.’ That is what the business community says, and that is what state and territory governments say. What do those opposite do? They pretend that they didn’t know. They pretend the former energy no-one didn’t know about regulations that he was delivering to hide a determination by the Australian Energy Regulator, until it just happened to be [that they] replaced the 1 May with 25 May. In between 1 May and 25 May? What happened? What was it that happened on 21 May? [The election, in case you forgot.] They wanted to avoid the Australian people before they voted, knowing about the hike in energy prices that was occurring on their watch because of their failure to invest in energy. And he runs out of time. Milton Dick gives a general warning to the whole chamber, because he is still trying to pretend he has control over the members. Peter Dutton asks Anthony Albanese to withdraw the “unparliamentary language” he used against Angus Taylor. Albanese: Mr Speaker, it’s one of the nicest things I’ve said about the shadow treasurer. Just wanted to give a bit of space between those posts and what is happening in the parliament now. Peter Dutton opens question time with: I refer to the economic plan and budget strategy available on the Labor party’s website, page seven of the document outlined a five-point economic plan, the first point is and I quote, ‘to cut power bills by $275 a year by 2025’. With the budget confirming this promise has been broken, will the prime minister admit the economic plan is in ruins? The Speaker, Milton Dick, tries to get ahead of the circus: The leader of the opposition has asked this question and I just said that the prime minister will be heard in silence. I want to be clear today, questions will be heard in silence out of respect of the office of the person asking them but also, answers will be heard in silence. And I give the call to the prime minister. (But also, lols – this is his circus and these are his monkeys, so good luck trying to wrangle this lot.) Albanese: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And indeed, before the election, there were a range of things said and indeed, when confronted with the fact that when in government, there was a warning of a pending spike in energy prices and that the announcement was delayed until after the election. This is what the former ... (INTERJECTIONS). … This is what the shadow treasurer said yesterday, the 26th of October, he said this: that was a report from the Australian Energy Regulator. It puts it out, not me, and I didn’t say it. That’s what he said. Yesterday, yesterday. Well, that’s interesting, Mr Speaker. Because this is the very document that goes to the increase that has occurred in the default retail price which has fed into energy prices increasing by figures around about 20%. He said he didn’t see it and didn’t know about it. An interesting statement. Here, of course, is a document, 22-23, the final determination of May 2022 and I tabled the document. I tabled a document from the Australian Energy Regulator. But at the same time, at the same time, here is the change in the law, dated the 31 March, 2022 and like he said, he didn’t see it, didn’t know about it, he puts it out, not me … Paul Fletcher: It’s on relevance. He’s had a 2-minute preamble. You should bring him back to the topic of the question, the $275 reduction that was promised. Albanese: Point of order, Mr Speaker. The question went to what was said about energy prices before the election in May 2022. My answer has gone to ... (The opposition benches all interject.) Albanese: I was going to what was happening to prices in May 2022, and [that] can’t be more relevant to the question that was asked by the leader of the opposition. So I’d ask you to rule against the point of order. Dick: The prime minister is correct when he says that the question was about five points announced before the election. The prime minister is referring to the policy announcement and what was announced, so the prime minister is being directly relevant. And I give the call to the prime minister. And then it is finally back to the answer. Albanese: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. And here’s the regulation, the change in the law, 31 March 2022, from Angus Taylor, who said he didn’t see it or know anything about it. There’s two simple changes. Item 1, paragraph 17, omit may substitute the first business day of 25 May. How subtle is that? How subtle is that? They changed the law ... in March, when the regulation – after parliament couldn’t disallow the change in regulation because we were going into caretaker mode and [couldn’t] change it until after the election. What a farce. You have no credibility. And he has run out of time. Ahead of question time, during the 90-second statements, the member for Hasluck, Tania Lawrence spoke about the death of 15-year-old Cassius Turvey. Linda Burney and Marion Scrymgour were also obviously distressed. Peter Dutton calls for royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities Both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton are speaking on the anniversary of the national apology to survivors and victims of institutional child sexual abuse. Dutton says it is time for an inquiry into the sexual abuse of Indigenous and First Nations children. Dutton: The national apology came to fruition because of the royal commission, and in the spirit of the fourth anniversary and our enduring commitment to keep children safe, it is time for a new royal commission to examine child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. We support immediate action from this government and the Northern Territory government on this incredibly important issue. I thank the prime minister and the minister for their time … [I have] met with the prime minister on two occasions now and it is an issue that we continue to work on together. The Coalition dedicates ourselves to supporting action taken by the government; there is goodwill on both sides for this national issue that needs addressing now. Law enforcement committee issues statement on Lidia Thorpe’s referral to privileges committee The parliamentary joint law enforcement committee, of which Lidia Thorpe was a member, giving rise to a potential conflict of interest with her relationship with ex bikie Dean Martin, has issued a statement about the controversy. On Tuesday the Senate referred Thorpe to the privileges committee for investigation, after the Greens senator agreed to refer herself. In its statement, the law enforcement committee said: [The committee] has met to consider questions arising from Senator Thorpe’s failure to declare a personal relationship that could potentially be a conflict of interest while she was a member of the committee during the last parliament. The committee takes the integrity of its proceedings very seriously and [in] its meeting the committee affirmed its commitments to protecting the confidentiality of sensitive and classified material ... The committee also affirmed that members should declare conflicts of interest that relate to their duties, so that the declared matters can be dealt with appropriately. The committee noted the referral to privileges, and said it would “cooperate with that inquiry and may provide evidence ... as appropriate”. Question time is just a moment away so we are in the chamber for the 90-second statements and Anthony Albanese has just taken one of those slots to pay tribute to outgoing NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard. Who is from the Liberal party. Peter Dutton associated himself with the comments. Newest inflation data prompts banks to predict higher RBA cash rate hikes On interest rates, reverberations from Wednesday’s inflation report, banks have shifted their predictions of what the RBA’s peak cash rate will be. The annual CPI came in at 7.3%, or the highest since mid-1990, as we noted here. Westpac now expects the central bank will return to hiking by 50 basis points when it meets on Melbourne Cup Day, next Tuesday, doubling their forecast. Anyway, here’s how another half-percentage point rate increase will lift monthly interest repayments, according to RateCity. The CPI result also triggered the banks to predict the RBA will now have to lift its cash rate higher. Here’s how the various outcomes would translate into monthly repayments: It’s worth noting the budget calculations on future growth in the economy were modelled on the RBA’s cash rate peaking at 3.35% next year. Perhaps Treasury will look like optimists by next May when the 2023-24 budget is released. Senate inquiry into school refusal established The senate has established an inquiry into school refusal, which is something Sophie Black has been looking into. This is the motion which established the inquiry – which was moved by Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne. The national trend of school refusal or “School Can’t” – as distinct from truancy – that is affecting primary and secondary school aged children, who are unable to attend school regularly or on a consistent basis, with specific reference to: 1) the increasing number since the Covid-19 pandemic, of young people and their families who are experiencing school refusal; 2) how school refusal is affecting young people and their families and the impacts it is having on the employment and financial security of parents and carers; 3) the impacts and demands of the increasing case load on service providers and schools to support these students and their families; 4) how relevant state, territory and federal departments are working to monitor and address this growing school refusal challenge; and 5) any other related matters. School refusal isn’t just a case of kids not wanting to go to school – it is a health issue, impacting their emotional and mental wellbeing and leading to anxiety, physical ailments and more. It has really hit some families very hard, particularly since the pandemic. They actually make you identify all these birds before allowing you into the ACT. It’s one of the rules. Business confidence holds up despite rising costs, NAB says In light of the budget, discussion about soaring energy prices and the record string of six consecutive RBA rate hikes, it’s worth checking on how the economy is actually faring. Well, according to NAB’s quarterly survey of small- and mid-sized enterprises, conditions are softening but remain above longer-term averages. Confidence even edged higher in the September quarter, with the smallest firms more chipper than bigger ones (even with conditions actually deteriorating more for them than for larger companies). “SMEs in transport, accommodation &amp; food, finance, and wholesale all reported strong conditions, while conditions remained fairly robust across the states,” it said. Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said: “Across all our surveys, firms are reporting capacity utilisation at record levels and SMEs are no exception. “Clearly, with a very tight labour market and very strong demand, even the smallest firms are operating close to their limits,” he said. The health minister, Mark Butler, says the government is expecting advice in coming months from immunisation experts on whether Australians should be given the opportunity for a fifth dose of Covid vaccine, but is still urging millions of people who haven’t got a third dose yet to get their booster. Butler held a short Parliament House press conference to celebrate the passage of Labor’s cheaper medicines bill passing the parliament. He was asked about whether Australians will be given an opportunity for a yearly Covid dose, similar to annual flu jabs. Butler didn’t say specifically whether all Australians would be recommended to get an annual dose, but said Atagi – the technical advisory group on immunisation – was considering whether older people and those with immune conditions should be granted a fifth dose, on top of the current four. Butler said Atagi would give that guidance “in due course”, but that he didn’t expect it in “the near future”, saying it may be into 2023 before that change is considered. But he also took the opportunity to urge people who hadn’t yet received a third dose – which he said included 5 million eligible people – to get that booster shot. There are just under 30 minutes until the last QT of the week. There is a week break and then budget estimates will be held while the house sits. November is a little full, actually – three sitting weeks. And the possibility of a fourth being held in the second week of December is a spectre that won’t go away – it is really going to depend on how much legislation gets passed in the Senate in the last two weeks of November. Some more background on that space promise: The Albanese government’s pledge is in line with allies. In April the Biden administration committed “not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing” and it pointed to such tests being done by China and Russia. When the then defence minister Peter Dutton announced the launch of the Australian defence force’s new space command in March, he accused some countries – including Russia – of seeing “space as a territory for their taking”. Dutton cited an anti-satellite missile test in November last year when Russia “destroyed its own redundant Cosmos 1408, which left behind a cloud of more than 1,500 pieces of lethal debris that will take decades to clear”. The new head of Australia’s space command, Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, said in March: The activities by China and Russia, which have been fairly well documented in the public domain, scare me. I think our lack of capability at the moment against those threats … that is concerning. Air Commodore Nicholas Hogan, who joined the space command as the director general of space capability, raised concerns at the time that the lack of established norms or laws in space created a “wild west” scenario. Australian government pledges never to conduct ‘direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing’ The Australian government has announced a promise “to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing”. It says the pledge is “consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space” and it is calling on all nations “to make this commitment as a transparency and confidence building measure”. In a statement issued in the last few minutes, three senior ministers - Penny Wong, Richard Marles and Ed Husic – said: The Australian Government commits to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing, consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space. When carried out, these tests generate large amounts of debris that remain in space for years; threatening satellites and other space objects, and risking the long-term sustainability of human activity in space. The use of these missiles to destroy space objects is reckless, irresponsible and poses threats to space assets of all nations. Australia joins the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea in making this commitment toward a safer, more stable and peaceful space domain. Marles, the defence minister, said the government was making the pledge to demonstrate “Australia’s commitment to act responsibly to protect our national security interests”. Wong, the foreign affairs minister, said the global community “must work together to build a common understanding on rules and norms that can guide how states behave in outer space”. Husic, the minister for industry and science, said: Space technologies support critical services that improve national wellbeing and economic prosperity. This commitment is a responsible step to help ensure space assets are protected for the benefit of all Australians. Queensland police would be immediately dismissed if sentenced to imprisonment under new bill Queensland’s police minister, Mark Ryan, has introduced a bill to allow “the immediate dismissal” of police officers and recruits who are sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal offence. The minister said the legislation would change the current situation where a police officer may be imprisoned but not dismissed from the service until all criminal appeals have ended and a police disciplinary investigation is finalised. “The examples that we have heard during the public hearings of the commission of inquiry are completely unacceptable ... For people who do the wrong thing there is no place for them in the Queensland police service.” The proposed legislation comes after the state’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, conceded the current police disciplinary system is “broken” during an independent commission of inquiry. The inquiry heard a number of officers who had sexually assaulted junior colleagues had not been dealt with appropriately and instead were subjected to “local managerial resolution” – a remedial conversation with a supervisor. Ryan said the application of LMRs is governed by QPS policy and had already been addressed by the police commissioner. However, he said the government will “carefully consider” any recommendations from the commission of inquiry about the police discipline system and “will consult all stakeholders about any need for legislative amendments during this term of government.” The inquiry will hand its final report to the state government on 14 November. Shoot for the moon – worst-case scenario, you land on a piece of SpaceX space junk. About 223,000 Medlab Pathology customers had their personal information including health records, credit card numbers and Medicare numbers exposed in a cyber-attack in February, the company’s parent company, Australian Clinical Labs, has informed the Australian Stock Exchange. Medlab says the breach mostly affects people in NSW and Queensland, and the records exposed of most concern are: 17,539 individual medical and health records associated with a pathology test. 28,286 credit card numbers and individual names. Of these cards, 15,724 have expired, but 3,375 of the cards have the CVV code. 128,608 Medicare numbers and names. Medlab said it became aware of unauthorised third-party access to its system in February, and at the time external forensic specialists did not find evidence that information had been compromised. But in March, the Australian Cyber Security Centre contacted the company and said it had intelligence that Medlab may have been the victim of a ransomware attack. The company again said it did not believe any data was compromised. In June, ACSC contacted the company again to say that it believed Medlab data had been posted on the dark web. Medlab then found and downloaded the data, which the company said was “highly complex and unstructured” and then made attempts to remove it from the dark web permanently. The company has blamed the complexity and unstructured nature of the data for it taking so long to report publicly. NSW farmers and environment groups call for resumption of feral animal culls There are calls for the NSW government to resume culling of feral pests in the state’s national parks over concerns a five-week suspension has put ecosystems at risk. The state government put a temporary suspension in place while it reviewed safety practices after concerns were raised about a deer cull earlier this year in the Kosciuszko national park. That suspension was applied to all culling programs in all parks across the state, prompting concerns from environment groups and the NSW Farmers Association. The Invasive Species Council has called on the government to lift the suspension because the wet weather could lead to “exploding” numbers of feral animals in national parks. The council’s advocacy manager, Jack Gough, said: More feral horses, pigs and deer trashing our parks and adjoining areas will be a disaster for our native wildlife and ecosystems. He said the ban would also be alarming for farmers concerned about “foot and mouth disease preparedness as feral pigs and deer will be major spreaders of the disease if it reaches our shores”. Reg Kidd, a member of the NSW Farmers conservation and resource management committee, told The Sydney Morning Herald “we were flabbergasted to learn the government had put a stop to controlling feral animals in national parks”. He said: Putting a stop to feral animal control is irresponsible as it will impact the public, nature and private landowners such as farmers. The government says the suspension has only affected shooting operations. Other invasive species controls such as baiting and trapping have continued. A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said the agency will “always prioritise public safety” and the review was to ensure operations were being conducted with the highest safety standards. They said completion of the review was imminent and feral animal shooting operations were expected to recommence with “even stronger safety protocols” within the next week. The women’s budget statement event has been held. Mike Bowers was there: NSW and Victoria announce joint funding for $558m redevelopment of Albury Base hospital Tamsin Rose and Benita Kolovos report on what is happening on the border of Vic and NSW: The premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have announced a joint plan to fund a $558m redevelopment of the Albury Base hospital in a bid to improve healthcare for people living in the border region. The announcement, from two leaders on opposite sides of the political aisle who have developed a strong history of collaboration, comes a month out from the Victorian state election and four months ahead of the NSW state poll. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the project served as a “great example of cooperation across political lines” to get results for people in the border region. His Victorian counterpart, Daniel Andrews, added that it was important to ensure community members and healthcare professionals “have the facilities they need”. Premier Perrottet dismissed suggestions that the announcement was a political stunt ahead the state elections both premiers face. He said: Dan and I work closely together. It’s not about politics. It’s about actually getting the job done and working together to achieve great things for our state. The elections are irrelevant. It’s not about that, it’s about our people and being focused on this. Both states will chip in $225m for the redevelopment, in addition to the $108m already allocated by the NSW and commonwealth governments, with construction to begin next year. It is slated to be completed by 2027. Energy ministers prepare to meet in Melbourne As energy ministers prepare to jet into Melbourne (offsetting the carbon, we trust), the various ministers are honing their pitches. As noted in an earlier post, lowering energy prices will be high on the discussion agenda. Since the last such gathering in August, we’ve had some big announcements from Queensland and Victoria (as astutely summarised in this article by Graham Readfearn). Public ownership has certainly loomed larger of late, particularly in Victoria, with its revival of the State Electricity Commission (as we explored here). Queensland’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, also laid out here the benefits of controlling most of the electricity generators and the handy use of a levy on windfall coal profits to give rebates to households. Anyway, de Brenni tells us today that “the best path to secure lower prices is energy independence through more renewable energy”, in comments that probably all of the attending energy ministers will agree on. However, he couldn’t resist a serve at his Coalition counterparts, saying that policy instability over the past decade has been a big part of our present woes. Had the previous federal LNP government delivered a cogent policy to encourage renewables, Australia wouldn’t be so exposed to the volatility of global fossil fuel markets. You could generate more clean energy shuffling your feet down a carpeted hallway than Angus Taylor and the federal LNP delivered in over a decade. And the cheaper medicines bill is also getting through the parliament. Mark Butler will be holding a press conference on that at 12.30 The Senate is pushing through its legislation agenda: And for a temperature check on that, in case you missed it, here is Murph: Chalmers: electricity market not resilient and robust due to ‘decade of policy failures’ Given electricity prices and the $275 savings by 2025 promise will undoubtably feature in Peter Dutton’s budget reply speech, here is what Jim Chalmers had to say about it this morning on ABC Radio RN: I think the full impact of the war in Ukraine is starting to be felt when it comes to electricity prices. We didn’t have these forecasts obviously, which are relatively new forecasts for electricity prices. We didn’t have them in May, of course. But I think people do understand around the community that the war in Ukraine is causing havoc. It’s pushing up electricity prices, and our electricity market here is not as resilient and robust as we need it to be because we’ve had a decade of policy failure. Q: But given the invasion of Ukraine occurred by the May election campaign, shouldn’t Labor have known its modelling was out of date? Chalmers: That’s because it goes to the fundamental fact here – which is renewable energy is not just cleaner energy, it’s also cheaper energy – that is the near unanimous view of investors and economists and others. That remains the case. There’s basically three facts here: first of all, renewable energy is cheaper energy. Secondly, the war in Ukraine is causing havoc and pushing up electricity prices. And, thirdly, the fact that our predecessors had more than 20 energy policies and pulled more capacity out of the system than they put in has made us more vulnerable to these global price shocks. If you haven’t read this yet, you should: Sussan Ley says tax cuts are good and IR reforms are not Sussan Ley, who as the deputy opposition leader has been handed the mantle of chief government attacker (the leaders like to keep their hands mostly clean from political attacks so voters don’t view them as too negative – this is a cross party tactic), says she thinks the industrial relations system is not broken and the stage-three tax cuts will help workers: No, the system is not broken and it’s no excuse to introduce pattern bargaining across this country which allows people in businesses in Western Australia who have a completely unrelated set of circumstances in which they operate their business as employees to somehow be included with businesses and workers on the east coast. It actually doesn’t make any sense at all. In fact, it makes the system more inflexible. What this is, is this government taking industrial relations system back to the 1970s* and not having at its centre productivity in the workplace or a focus on increasing jobs and security for both employees and employers. And you know, what if this government cares about the wages of workers, what it could do is guarantee the stage three tax cuts today, because everyone earning $45,000 or more gets help. The stage three tax cuts will put more money in workers’ pockets** and give them the support that they need when they plan for the future. *That would actually be impossible, given the low union membership, the Fair Work Commission and the fact that the conditions are completely different. We are not in stagflation, company profits have continued upwards, and work conditions are very, very different. **If they earn over $180,000. Sussan Ley says government’s IR legislation will ‘take us back decades’ The Liberal MP is not a fan of the industrial relations bill: Let’s look at the detail, but what this is a rushed introduction of legislation that takes us back decades under the cover of the budget this week. That’s what this is. It could not come at a worse time for businesses who are struggling with staff shortages, who are struggling with increasing costs, for manufacturers they’re looking at power prices that are almost unaffordable. This government does not have their back. This pattern style, industry wide bargaining will increase strike action*. In fact, when asked to guarantee that it wouldn’t this morning on breakfast radio the industrial relations minister couldn’t do that. They also refused to say when it would increase workers’ wages. What this is, is the Labor party looking after the unions, making sure that they keep their promises to their union mates. *In terms of strike action, it pays to put the Australian experience in context – strike action is almost non-existent in this country now. It is at historic lows, along with union membership. Meanwhile, there is still a major focus on health funding – and what will happen when the 50-50 hospital funding deal expires. People living in poverty far more vulnerable to domestic violence, research shows While the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave (to start from next year) is a good start, it is also worth remembering people living in poverty are particularly vulnerable. Last week was Anti-Poverty Week. The Anti-Poverty Week website resources include these facts: New research from the Life Course Centre found young Australian women (aged 21-28 years) in financial hardship are more than 3 times as likely to report being the victim of past-year severe partner abuse: 9.3% compared with 2.9% for those not experiencing financial hardship. The rates were also around double for any partner abuse or unwanted sexual activity. Rates of violence are higher for groups that face multiple forms of discrimination, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women with disability, older women, women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds including women on temporary visas, and those in the LGBTIQA+ community. Women from refugee backgrounds are particularly at risk of financial abuse and reproductive coercion. …and poverty can deter women from leaving Australian Women Against Violence Alliance have estimated that. on average, it costs $18,000 for a victim/survivor to leave a violent relationship and establish safety. This includes costs associated with reallocation, safety upgrades and legal and medical costs Breaking into the political news to update you on the Bruce Lehrmann trial. Chris Knaus reports: The entire jury in the trial of Bruce Lehrmann has been discharged after a juror was found to have conducted their own research and brought outside material into the jury room. The ACT supreme court convened on Thursday morning and heard that a juror had conducted research outside the courtroom, contrary to their oath. Chief justice Lucy McCallum said she had no choice but to discharge one of the 12 jurors. She said that meant she had to discharge them all. Paul Karp is looking through the IR legislation and has found where the conflict will be: Power prices on the agenda when ministers meet on Friday Not the biggest surprise, but energy affordability – along with supply and reliability – will head the agenda for the federal, state and territory ministers when they gather in Melbourne on Friday. Chris Bowen, the federal minister for climate change and energy, told Guardian Australia that work on the National Energy Transformation Partnership aimed at supporting “the smooth transformation of Australia’s energy sector” will also be on the agenda. There’s no mention of the provision of rebates for energy as proposed by NSW’s treasurer Matt Kean, who will be only one of two Liberals in the room. (Guy Barnett should be the other. Along with premier of Tasmania, he has a few hats, including water and veteran affairs...so he must be taking part in federal gatherings every other week.) Bowen’s line is that: “We are now building on this reform program with all jurisdictions to deliver much needed long-term certainty to industry and investors to put downward pressure on prices and ensure reliability of the system.” That pressure is not yet having the desired effect, it should be said. Anyway, as for the size of the power prices rises in the budget, Bowen makes it clear that the first instalment of those 20% and 30% has already taken effect. (The budget wasn’t clear.) “The budget shows that treasury has assumed retail electricity prices have already increased by an average of 20% nationally in 2022-23,” he said. “This largely reflects increases that took effect in the September quarter, including the increase to the Default Market Offer that the former government hid before the election.” If you want to more about that hiding, here’s our story back in May: The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has introduced Labor’s wide-ranging industrial relations bill which improves access to flexible work and removes hurdles to multi-employer bargaining. Burke told the House of Representatives that Australia’s workplace laws “are not up to date”, warning the opposition that, given the cost of living crisis is the gap between incomes and rising prices, they “can’t claim to care about cost of living if [they] support continued wage stagnation”. Burke said that adding gender equity as an object of the Fair Work Act would help close the “unacceptable” gender pay gap of 14.1%, while the bill would remove “insurmountable hurdles” to getting equal pay orders, such as childcare workers who lost a case because they couldn’t fulfil the “impossible task” of finding a male comparator group. Burke said: These reforms are intended to reverse decades of unfair outcomes for women. It will no longer be necessary to establish sex discrimination to prove work has been undervalued.” The bill also contains an “express prohibition” against workplace sexual harassment, and bolsters existing anti-discrimination protections. With curbs on rolling fixed term contracts, the bill will help employees experiencing the “permanent probation period”, he said. The bill’s most controversial changes are to make multi-employer bargaining significantly easier to access, but Burke presented them as incremental changes to existing streams of bargaining. Burke said under existing single-interest bargaining, parties need to get his permission to bargain together, a form of red tape that will be removed. Employers must have clearly identifiable common interests and FWC must be satisfied it is in the public interest,” he said, suggesting the reform will help businesses compete on innovation and service not “who can pay the lowest wage”. Burke also noted consultation is ongoing and didn’t rule out further amendments to better implement safeguards which include guaranteeing that single-employer agreements are still available, and that multi-employer deals are “not extended to those industries where it is not appropriate or not necessary such as commercial construction”. Burke said the bill will give the Fair Work Commission power to resolve “intractable disputes through arbitration” where there is “no prospect” of agreement. This will encourage good faith bargaining and quick resolution of disputes. Agreements signed under the Coalition’s WorkChoices laws will be sunsetted, “businesses need to pay minimum entitlements in awards, to benefit workers and level the playing field”, he said. Changes to the better off overall test will mean the commission uses “actual workers and patterns of work that are foreseeable” to judge a pay deal, taking a “global rather than line by line” approach. If employers and employees agree a pay deal passes the test, the commission will give “primary consideration” to their view. If circumstances change, a pay deal can be reassessed. “This makes sure that no worker will be worse off,” Burke said. And on wages ... There is an event around the woman’s budget statement a little later this morning. Anthony Albanese will deliver a speech at about 10.30am. Big shake up, small turnout in the House as IR bill is introduced Mike Bowers was in the chamber to capture the introduction of legislation for the biggest IR shake up in more than a decade – but most of the opposition was not. Tony Burke commends the bill to the house: This bill delivers on the government’s commitment to ensure a fairer workplace relations system that provides Australians with job security, gender equity and sustainable wage growth. This bill will not fix every problem in our workplace relations system, but it’s a strong start, and it will provide a strong foundation on which we can continue to build a fairer and more equitable system Australians need, want and deserve. Now there will be requests for us to move more slowly, to wait extra months to pretend that there is no urgency as this bill proceeds through the House and in the other place. I asked members and senators to remember how long people have already waited – they have waited a decade, while wages were kept deliberately low. Waited generations while the gender pay gap refused to close, waited while children became adults, while caring responsibilities collided with rosters, waited in insecure work for the secure job, which still hasn’t arrived. These Australians have waited long enough. And while waiting, they have turned up every day and done their job. It’s now time we did ours and legislated for secure jobs and better pay. I commend the build the house. Tony Burke says the IR legislation will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This isn’t new – it was one of Labor’s stated aims since it was introduced. But this line of his speech still gets applause from the government side of the chamber. This bill will abolish the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. The Fair Work Ombudsman will have carriage of all industries. Family violence leave also applies to casuals, Tony Burke says Family and domestic violence paid leave should be in place at most workplaces from 1 February next year, for most employees. Small businesses get an extra six months to adjust to the new workplace entitlement, so it will be August 2023 for those workers. Tony Burke says it also applies to casuals: Family and domestic violence leave has to be a universal entitlement. Women can be victims of domestic violence no matter what job they work, how long they’ve been in that job, what sort of agreement they’re on or how many hours a week they work. In fact, women who are experiencing family and domestic violence are more likely to be employed in casual and insecure work. We can’t leave them behind. Violence doesn’t discriminate – and neither should the law. Greens welcome domestic violence leave but say more funding needed for women’s safety The Greens have welcomed the passing of the family and domestic violence paid leave legislation. But Larissa Waters also pointed out last night that there is no new funding for frontline responses in the budget: Paid Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) leave will help victim-survivors, who are predominantly women, to escape abusive relationships, protect themselves and their children, and rebuild their lives. But paid FDV leave cannot succeed if advice and support services for victim-survivors and employers don’t have funding to meet demand. The long-awaited National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children has now been released, but without any new funding commitments. The women’s safety sector has repeatedly called for a $1B per year investment to ensure funding meets demand. And yet the government’s budget response was to re-badge and re-shuffle previous funding commitments, adding only partial indexation and a fraction of the workers needed, with the Labor government instead choosing tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for donor mates. You can read more about the flexible work component here: As usual, Paul Karp has been all over this What will the industrial relations bill do? Tony Burke’s office is on it – here is part of the release which lays out what the government says this bill will do: The Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill will: - Help close the 14.1 per cent gender pay gap and protect women in the workplace by: putting gender equity at the heart of the Fair Work Commission’s decision-making; boosting the Commission’s gender pay gap expertise; banning pay secrecy clauses; expanding access to flexible work arrangements; and expressly prohibiting sexual harassment in the Fair Work Act. - Improve job security by placing new limits on rolling fixed term contracts so workers can’t be effectively put on an endless probation period. - Protect workers by: bolstering their ability to recover unpaid entitlements under the Fair Work small claims system; banning job ads that advertise for below the relevant minimum pay rate; and closing a loophole to protect firefighters in the ACT. - Return fairness to the workplace by abolishing the politicised, discredited and unnecessary Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission. -Modernise the bargaining system by expanding access to enterprise bargaining and multi-employer bargaining; reforming the Better Off Overall Test so it’s simple, flexible and fair; making it easier to initiate bargaining; giving the Fair Work Commission new powers to resolve long-running intractable disputes; and terminating WorkChoices-era “zombie” agreements. IR bill will improve gender equality and help stop sexual harassment, Burke says In the chamber, Tony Burke says with this IR bill, all the Respect at Work report legislative recommendations are now before the parliament. Workers who want to have a discussion about pay equity at work should not be prohibited by their employment contracts when doing so. This bill will prohibit pay secrecy clauses bringing transparency to workplaces critically, this bill protects workers by saying if you want to tell people how much you are paid that is up to you. Stamping out workplace sexual harassment is central to achieving safe, productive and gender equitable workplaces. Under the previous government’s laws, there was no express prohibition on sexual harassment under the Fair Work Act and stopped sexual harassment orders were only available to some workers. We will fix these issues. Our changes mean whether you’re a nurse in Tamworth, a plumber in Perth or an office worker in Canberra, you can ask the Fair Work Commission to deal quickly and effectively with your complaint of sexual harassment in the Fair Work Commission. Whether the harassment occurred in the past or is ongoing or both. The new provisions will also allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate and assist with compliance. These changes send a clear message that workplace sexual harassment will not be tolerated. These reforms fully implement recommendation 28 of the respect at work report, complementing the attorney general’s proposed reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act. This bill means that all legislative changes recommended by respect at work are now before the parliament. Burke says IR bill won’t create more industrial action from workers Tony Burke was pressed this morning on whether multi-employer bargaining would lead to more industrial action. He was asked by Patricia Karvelas: “The big concern from business groups is that this will lead to a lot more industrial action. Is that ultimately where this will end?” Burke: Australia has low rates of industrial action, and that won’t change. That won’t change. Karvelas: But this opens the door to it changing? Burke: Well, no, no, no. Because you can already have industrial action on a single-employer agreement. What we are doing, though – and I think what has really frustrated people – is that when you get this long, protracted industrial action, including in single employer agreements, at the moment those long disputes have no way of being resolved. And we’re introducing, when the commission believes it has become intractable, that you can now have arbitration where they look at – ‘OK, here are the issues that have been agreed. Here are the issues that haven’t been agreed. Let’s sort it out.’ And that way the long, protracted, neverending disputes, which are often the ones in the media, they should become much less common. I’m hoping they become a thing of the past. Karvelas: Okay, but clearly though you’re saying, you know, we have low industrial action, and that’s right. This allows for industrial action across workplaces, does it not? That is the ultimate consequence of this bill. Burke: That’s right, but the rules in being able to do it are no different to what they would be if you were doing a single-employer negotiation. Karvelas: Sure, but all of a sudden you have a lot more workers striking potentially. Burke: Look, there are lots of forms of industrial action and lots of them much more lowkey than that. The big difference here – well, first of all, before any industrial action – even single – at the moment you can go – you go straight to it after you’ve had your vote of workers. There’ll now be compulsory conciliation to try to sort these disputes out. That may of itself across the board put real downward pressure on industrial action because we get issues solved first. And then if they’re continuing arbitration, which has not been there before, becomes available. It’s a much more sensible outcome. A crucial review of the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) is expected to make recommendations to the Albanese government well before it hands down its final report next year. The review, to be led by chair Bruce Bonyhady and experienced public servant Lisa Paul, is shaping up as pivotal to the future of the scheme and the hundreds of thousands of participants who rely on it, following Tuesday’s budget forecasts. The government also announced a major crackdown on NDIS fraud in the budget, tipped to rake in about $200m, but it has acknowledged the review is looking into reform of the scheme, including to make it more “sustainable”. The budget forecast the total cost of federal, state and territory funding for the NDIS is expected to increase from $35bn this year to $52bn in 2025-26, an $8.8bn increase compared to the figures in the May budget. Queensland’s disability services minister, Craig Crawford, told Guardian Australia disability ministers were “all concerned about the fiscal risk in the projected funding for NDIS over coming years”. “But the cost blowouts need to be managed without stopping new entrants coming onto the scheme that deserve to be there. “Queensland also welcomes the crackdown on fraud and cowboy operators.” The NSW disability services minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, told Guardian Australia fraud in the scheme was a “significant concern” and the disability ministers agreed “more needs to be done in this space”. “The NSW Government will continue to work with the Commonwealth and other states and territories to ensure that the NDIS is sustainable and delivers as intended for people with disability.” A Victorian government spokesperson told Guardian Australia the review was an “important opportunity to examine key issues underlying the scheme to ensure it operates as originally intended”. Disability groups warned discussion around cost must also consider the social and economic benefits, pointing to a Per Capita report which found every $1 spent on the scheme spurned $2.25 in economic activity. Ross Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, told Guardian Australia the funds provided to NDIS participants were not “squirrelled away” by people with disability. “They are putting money back into the economy to pay for the supports they need to live an ordinary life,” he said. Joyce also argued the NDIS was saving money in other areas such as health and mental health, but those savings were not easily calculated. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is now introducing the industrial relations bill. He says Australia’s IR system is no longer working and it is beyond time to change it. But he says this bill, if passed, won’t be able to solve issues like wage growth overnight. Australians have asked for change. They’ve asked for less conflict and fairer pay. They’ve asked for a better future for themselves and for their families. It will take time for this bill to result in improvements in workplaces and pay increases in the pockets of Australians. So we cannot waste a moment in passing it. The family and domestic violence leave bill is passed on the voices. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. There is applause in the house. The plan for parliament today The parliament is sitting. Tony Burke is up and he is laying out the day’s business. Peter Dutton gets the budget reply this evening (about 7.30pm). And it looks like the family and domestic violence leave is one of the first issues of the House (the Senate sat late last night to pass it). So it is back in the house for the amendments to be passed. (The amendments are agreed to by the government, so this will be quick) After that, we are going straight into industrial relations. Ley says Morrison government handed over ‘strong economy’ and Labor ‘haven’t got a plan’ Sussan Ley was very critical of the government’s budget on Sky News this morning and was asked what she believed the answers were. She said: Well, we aren’t the government, we handed the government a strong economy. In fact, Jim Chalmers said, when we handed down our budget ‘what we need is a plan to tackle the sting of inflation’. So where is his plan? What’s he doing? Where is the reassurance that Australians need that things will start to get better? They will only feel that if they know this government has a plan. Now, in terms of what to do, Pete, there are many things. We made affordable power prices a priority when we were in government. We understood that that’s the perspective that you have to have when you look at this issue, so that we don’t find that people can’t afford to turn on the coolers, or turn on the heaters, or run their manufacturing equipment in their businesses. Now, that’s not the approach this government has had. They’ve talked to the game on renewables, but they haven’t realised the cost. They haven’t realised, for example, that more supply into the market makes sense. They haven’t got a plan. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi will give notice of a private senator’s bill she will introduce today aiming to halt the indexation on student loans and increase the repayment threshold to above the median wage. Faruqi says it is one way which would help ease the cost of living burden on people with student debt: Student debt is no small problem. About three million people in Australia have the burden of student debt. At a time when the cost of living is biting hard, governments can no longer ignore the student debt crisis and its impacts. Study debts are impacting people’s ability to obtain loans, their mental health, their ability to save up to buy a home or simply afford to live a good life. Scrapping indexation on HELP debts and raising the minimum repayment threshold will provide much needed money in people’s pockets to make ends meet or pay rent. Faruqi says higher education should be free and this legislation is one step in that direction and has challenged the Labor government to work with the Greens “to wind back Liberal era policies which have saddled people with more debt that takes longer and longer to pay off”. And this is what Jennifer Westacott, the head of Business Council, had to say about industrial relations in an interview with Ausbiz yesterday: What we have said all the time is that we want wages to grow, and we want them to stay growing. Not to have a short-term growth and then have at the expense of potentially higher unemployment. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is we’ve got to get an IR system that drives productivity. That’s not about working harder for less, it’s about working smarter. It’s about creating the environment where people use new technology, where they innovate, where they share ideas, where they open new markets, where they have more skilled people. It’s about creating value by doing things differently. That requires a collaborative workplace at an enterprise level. We want to see the enterprise bargaining system revitalised. What we don’t want to see is more complexity. What we don’t want to see is industry-wide bargaining, which we think will really hurt productivity, and in the long term, hurt wages growth. What we don’t want to see is widespread industrial action. We hear a lot of the unions saying what we want out of this reform is the capacity for widespread industrial action. The community doesn’t want that and our economy is too fragile, to really take rolling strikes like we had in 1983. So that’s IR. Then we’ve really got to have a mature conversation about tax reform. We try to do this in this country, every time we do, someone shuts it down, and we never make any progress. The simple reality is we’ve got a spending and a revenue problem. The third thing we have to do, which is not a matter for business, but the matter for government, but it’s hugely important, is control spending in those areas like NDIS. Control spending in health, not by cutting costs, but by getting better outcomes. That’s going to require investment in technology, workforce, and so on. We’ve got to be willing to tackle red tape and the micro-economic reform that needs to be done, that gets rid of all the friction in the economy. We’ve got to stay on course for the migration targets that we welcome in the budget last night. So, there’s a lot of stuff to do. To be honest, we can’t wait for the May budget to get on with some of it but get on with it we have to. Because we’re looking around the world and you’ve just been reporting on this. You’ve got the UK in a political and economic crisis. What does that mean? Well, it means tough times for people living in the UK. We don’t want that for Australians. It is fair to say that business is not too happy with multi-employer bargaining. Or that they are yet to see the industrial relations bill. The warnings that people will lose their jobs have already begun. But on the flip side, wages haven’t increased in about a decade, union membership has fallen and the idea we might see the wildcat strikes of the 1970s given the Fair Work hoops seems wildly over inflated. Here is what Sally McManus has to say about it. She told the ABC: At the moment we’ve got a situation where the wages are moving for CEOs. They went up 40% this year . Productivity, labour productivity has gone up 13% and workers have seen less than 1% of that. Clearly there’s a problem at the moment. Like when the economy is good, workers don’t get pay rises. When the economy is bad, it’s the same thing. So, I mean, clearly there’s a big problem in terms of the underlying structure of our bargaining system and that’s what we’ve got to fix. If we’ve people on a more equal footing you get better outcomes, it’s a pretty straightforward solution to it by doing that. We like to see more co-operation in the country. We would like to see businesses recognising they can’t have their employees, the workers of this country, the people who spend in small businesses, in a situation where wages have been held down for so long and unfairly. Meanwhile, Murph has a reality check on how we ended up where we have with energy prices. In the Senate yesterday, Greens senator Lidia Thorpe spoke about the death of 15-year-old Noongar boy Cassius Turvey, who was killed as he walked home from school. A man has been charged, but police investigations are continuing. Today I rise for a 15-year-old First Nations child, Cassius Turvey. Cassius Turvey was a loved member of the Noongar community who ran his own lawn-mowing business and would let community members decide how much they could pay him. On 13 October, Cassius was returning home from school when he allegedly was viciously beaten with a pole. He passed away eight days later. When a First Nations child is born, they inherit and learn cultural wisdom, knowledge and strength. Our families gather and we wrap our arms around our babies, knowing that they’re our dreaming children. Their blood line is their birthright. This is our children’s land. It is their country, and they’re guided by our ancestors. If only it were a reality that our children could live out their birthright in this country; that they would live a journey of peace, culturally and spiritually safe. No Aboriginal child should be robbed of their birthright in so-called Australia. Our Dreaming child, Cassius, fell victim to a monster—a monster far greater than those who (allegedly) racially targeted and killed Cassius. The monster is the unresolved violent legacy of white Australia. To Cassius’s family, friends and community: I’m sorry. To black Australia: I’m sorry. I am sorry that we are here again with yet another justice hashtag for the loss of another black life. No black child should fear walking home from school and no black mother should wonder if their child will return home. We all must fight for a country where First Nations children like Cassius can live out their birthright. Cassius: may you rest as we rise and continue the fight. Rod Sims thinks Labor should threaten gas companies with export limits No one in the government is saying yet what they will be doing about energy prices, but the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head has waded in with some thoughts: “Has anyone wrangled a camel before?” a member of the Foxtrot One in-water rescue team asks apprehensively from the boat. “Ah, it’s domesticated,” another member, Anthony Walgate, reassures him. Fire and Rescue NSW yesterday afternoon carried out a “humpday” operation to rescue a domesticated camel stranded in floodwaters of the Murray River near Moama. The emergency authority said: Gina the domestic camel had wandered off from her small herd on the property towards the river, ignoring repeated attempts by her owner to coax her away from the water’s edge. The local resident was concerned because camels cannot swim Wading through the river up to their chests, the specially-trained rescue technicians used hay to lure Gina out of the floodwater and back to dry land. She was soon returned to the herd unharmed. For the Fire and Rescue NSW crew, their ‘dromedary’ drama was done and dusted. These firefighters adding ‘Camel Wrangling’ to their long list of rescue capabilities. The defence minister Richard Marles is speaking about Australian troops being sent to help train Ukraine forces. Daniel Hurst has you covered on that. Chalmers slip up – after a question he says he misheard – makes headlines Jim Chalmers is still doing the media rounds and he’s sounding a little tired. Yesterday he made his first misstep – he misheard a question at the press club about whether Labor stood by its $275 lower power bills election promise and the treasurer said yup, it’s in the budget. In question time he said he had contacted the journalist who asked it immediately after to say he misheard the question and thought he had been asking something else. His mistake is the front page of the Daily Telegraph today. But the focus is what is the government going to do to lower electricity prices. Chalmers said he isn’t going to pre-empt what the government’s consultation brings, but intervention into the market is one of the things under consideration. Happy budget reply day to those who celebrate. Peter Dutton will deliver his first budget reply speech at about 7.30pm (the same time the treasurer delivered his on Tuesday) where the opposition will lay out its plan to deal with Australia’s cost of living issues. Although you’ll probably hear a lot about the government’s lack of a plan, based on the criticisms from the opposition so far. But before then, the parliament has to get through a busy day of trying to pass as much legislation as possible, given there are only a handful of sitting weeks left until the end of the year. The Senate agreed to sit later last night so there might be a few cranky heads in the red chamber this morning. The main legislative game today will be the introduction of the government’s industrial relations bill, where a fight is looming over multi-employer bargaining. It’s a fight Tony Burke seems to be itching to have, and part of a plan to try to lift wages across the country. The bill is also aiming for more flexible work options for people who might need it. It’s a pretty big shake up of the industrial system and business is not on board for all of it. Neither is the opposition. Hence the brewing fight. And of course, there is also energy and what the government is going to do about future price increases. After yesterday’s inflation numbers and treasury’s forecasts, people want answers. We’ll bring you all of it as it happens. You have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst leading the way and Mike Bowers taking you into the hallways and chambers. Amy Remeikis will be on the blog for most of the day. I’ve already had three coffees and don’t know what today will bring. Maybe a cupcake for breakfast. It seems necessary. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/26/its-time-to-join-the-renewables-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T18:13:05Z","webTitle":"It’s time to join the renewables revolution | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/26/its-time-to-join-the-renewables-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/26/its-time-to-join-the-renewables-revolution","fields":{"headline":"It’s time to join the renewables revolution","bodyText":"The government’s decision to allow pension funds to dump investments in fossil fuels (Boost for fossil fuel divestment as UK eases pension rules, 18 December) is a major step forward but, with such progress on the issues around “fiduciary duty”, it is increasingly puzzling that MPs are still denied a say over where our pensions are invested – and blocked from holding our trustees to account. Over the last few years, I have repeatedly urged ministers to take action to clean up the MPs’ pension scheme, but they’ve been consistently obstructive. A failure to clean up this fund would be a dereliction of duty. If the government is serious about handing people control over their investments, they should urgently get their own house in order, by forcing the parliamentary pension fund to be more transparent – and to lead the way by divesting our savings from climate-wrecking fossil fuels. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • The excellent exposé on the appalling deal struck over Hinkley Point nuclear power station (The Long Read, 21 December) goes some way to explaining this government’s hostility to renewables, as in its announcement in the budget of the removal of subsidies from renewables. However, if as renewable energy gets cheaper and cheaper, ministers minds are clouded by the ridiculously high guaranteed “strike price” of £92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley generated power, who can be surprised? The government should be looking to get out of nuclear power entirely and join the rest of the world in the renewables revolution.

On paper, an MP can take maternity leave, regardless of whatever constitutional crisis is unfolding, thanks to “pairing”, where a counterpart will be found to cancel out your absence by not voting themselves. It is known as a “gentleman’s agreement”, which is a technical term, meaning: “It will be honoured until it actually matters, then it’s gloves off, suckers.” There should be a code for when you save your noblest, most altruistic behaviour for when it counts, and we could call that a lady’s agreement. On Tuesday, Brandon Lewis, Conservative party chairman, was paired with Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Lib Dems, who has a three-week-old baby. The non-voting pact was remembered all the way through the day, until it came to two Brexit amendment votes at the end, when he voted with the government to save it from what might otherwise have been a general-election-triggering defeat. The whips have taken the blame. Fair enough: it was late, people get tired, it’s easy to make an “honest mistake”, if by that you mean: “I honestly and mistakenly thought nobody would notice, since she’s a Lib Dem anyway, and a woman to boot.” Four Labour MPs committed their own acts of betrayal by voting with the government to keep this catastrophic show on the road, but we will have to leave them for another day. A further two Labour MPs were also paired for maternity leave, Laura Pidcock and Cat Smith – those pairings were both honoured. This is because Labour babies are cuter than Lib Dem babies. Look, I don’t make the rules. You could make the case that there is no endemic sexism here, since men have faced pairing crises in worse circumstances. For example, in 1979, when the terminally ill Sir Alfred Broughton was almost brought to the Commons in an ambulance for a vote of no confidence against the then Labour prime minister James Callaghan. The government collapsed and Broughton died five days later. The great pairing scandals of the 70s, though, are mainly remembered not for the ambulances drawing up to parliament, but for Michael Heseltine grabbing the mace and swinging it about, in another charming parliamentary custom where the mace stands in for anything else an honourable member might want to swing. The troubling arrival of potentially childbearing MPs in representative democracy has raised questions about how hospitable the Commons is to women. The fresh wind of modernity brought with it reasonable objections, such as: “Why can’t I breastfeed in here, when you’re allowed to swing a mace?” Brexit, however, has always been a throwback male affair. The women involved – even the PM – look less like colleagues, and more like hostages in a roid-rage event. But this has surely hit its hard limit: to cheat a woman with a new baby is elementally unjust, signalling total rottenness from the inside out. There is no fit penance for Lewis, but I like the idea of making him give all his votes, in perpetuity, to baby Gabriel Swinson, who will choose, by giving some baby signal, which way he wants Lewis to vote. What price nuclear power? Its cost could be what finally persuades us to ditch it Nuclear power has hit what might be its derailing pothole: it is not as cheap as renewable energy. The National Infrastructure Commission came back with this conclusion as tactfully as it could, as if trying to put nuclear in a care home without upsetting it: it’s not that there’s anything wrong with new nuclear power stations. It is just that they won’t be on stream until the 2030s, while solar and wind are already so good, improving so fast, that should we not … could we not consider just doing that? The campaign against this energy source started in parallel with that for disarmament in the 1970s and 80s: stickers with a big, smiling sun saying “Nuclear Power? No Thanks!” The underlying message was: “Why not use the sun instead?”, a hippy pipe-dream that, inconveniently for the massed forces of anti-hippy, turned out to be very sensible. There was also the risk of nuclear accident, which could wreak devastation undreamed of even by people who killed things on purpose. This, too, came to pass, although it has taken the 30-plus years since Chernobyl, still in a 30km exclusion zone, to digest this as fact. There were anxieties about waste management and the ambient discharge of radioactivity, none of which was ever allayed, and more recently, a soft-nationalist argument that if we had to build nuclear power plants, we should do it ourselves and not hand it to the French and Chinese. In short, every argument – patriotic, scientific, ecological and humanitarian – has been levelled against nuclear power, yet the only dart to scratch its resilient hide is that it is perhaps not as cheap as it at first appeared. It is inevitable that it would take this long, if we only value what we can count. But there are loads of things that we evaluate by criteria other than money: relationships; art; tomatoes. We shouldn’t have to wait until “best” coincides with “cheapest”. Warning: man eats shark A 9ft blue shark has been spotted close to the shore at St Ives, in Cornwall, but is it really blue, or is that just the beautiful light? Never mind the grace and majesty, for the time being, swimmers are being forcefully advised not to get into the water with the Prionace glauca. They should be warning the shark: this is the most dangerous place in the country, maybe even the world, to be high-density, high-protein edible marine life. Someone’s probably making a romesco sauce as we speak, and writing a complicated price per kilo on a chalkboard. • This article was amended on 23 July 2018. An earlier version said Sir Alfred Broughton “was stiffed by his Tory opposite, Bernard Weatherill, in a vote of no confidence”. In fact Weatherill, the Conservative deputy chief whip, in discussions with Walter Harrison, Labour’s deputy chief whip, did agree to a pairing arrangement that would have obviated bringing Broughton to the Commons for the vote. But Harrison then decided not to hold Weatherill to the agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2019/jul/22/the-english-job-understanding-iran-why-it-distrusts-britain-by-jack-straw-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-22T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"The English Job by Jack Straw review – portrait of Iran’s fixation with Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/22/the-english-job-understanding-iran-why-it-distrusts-britain-by-jack-straw-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/jul/22/the-english-job-understanding-iran-why-it-distrusts-britain-by-jack-straw-review","fields":{"headline":"The English Job by Jack Straw review – portrait of Iran’s fixation with Britain","bodyText":"Almost four years ago, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw went on holiday with his wife and a couple of friends to Iran, where he experienced what he calls a “forced conscription into a thriller”. Visiting the cypress of Abarkuh, a tree estimated to be up to 5,000 years old, the foursome were confronted by a group of men dressed in religiously observant black. They were members of the Basij, the thuggish volunteer offshoot of the Revolutionary Guards, and they handed Straw a leaflet explaining why he was unwelcome in their country. The document detailed Britain’s perfidious 19th- and 20th-century track record in Iran and claimed that the recently retired Straw was a subversive agent of the British state, using his visit to sow discord. Thereafter the Basij followed the party everywhere until the Iranian police intervened. Armed and undercover, they bundled Straw and his friends into a car, as if they were being kidnapped, and whisked them away into hiding. As Straw drily notes, to be given police protection from criminals and terrorists is one thing, but to be given police protection against other parts of the state is quite another. “I can think of no other country in the world where that occurs,” he writes. The English Job: Understanding Iran and Why It Distrusts Britain is a response to that strange experience and the accusations made in the Basij leaflet. The book is highly readable, full of vivid history, diplomatic anecdotes and personal observation. It explains the peculiar circumstances of a country finely balanced between becoming a nuclear power and risking international isolation. It’s written in a manner that is balanced, dispassionate and yet sympathetic to the Iranian people. As Straw shows, Iran is a nation that remains anachronistically fixated on the UK, as if it were a superpower capable of extraordinary influence far beyond its shores. There is a reason for this. Britain did once fit that description, and there were few countries in which its long and clandestine reach was felt with more resentment than in Iran. In the 19th century, the Iranian shah Naser al-Din granted Britain what Straw calls “the most extraordinary and rapacious business concessions”. He did this partly to recruit the British empire as a buffer against Russian encroachment, and partly for personal gain, but its effect was to establish the suspicion that the British had “only malign intentions” for Iran. That suspicion grew steadily and was confirmed in 1953 with Britain’s grubby role, along with the US, in unseating the democratically elected Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in an orchestrated coup. Power then swung to the shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who became increasingly autocratic. Hated by many of his people, he was eventually forced to flee in the 1979 revolution. Straw, who in 2001 became the first senior British minister to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution, is clear-eyed about, and damning of, Britain’s part in empowering the shah. But he’s not about to fall for the flagrant historical revisionism practised by the religious authorities who have held control since Ayatollah Khomeini hijacked the revolution. “The myth in the Islamic republic today,” writes Straw, “is that the clerics stood foursquare with Mosaddegh. They did the opposite. Their overriding concern, then as now, was to preserve their power and influence within Iran.” That determination has led to a modern nation with enormous potential being strangled by a shadow clerical state that thwarts all attempts at political modernisation. There is, in effect, a two-state system. One is the elected politicians with their ministries and the appearance of a functioning democracy. The other, more powerful, is run by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and ensures democracy is largely cosmetic. There have been several reform-minded presidents who have sought to create a more representative politics at home and a less aggressive image abroad. They have all had to work under the watchful eye of Khamenei, and it has seldom gone well for them. And, should popular resistance grow, Khamenei is not afraid to fix elections, as he almost certainly did in 2009, triggering the Green movement protests. Straw makes the case that Mohammad Khatami, Iran’s president when Straw became foreign minister in 2001, was someone the west could have done business with. He was beginning to push through reforms and, post-9/11, there were signs of international collaboration with the US. But that opportunity was destroyed by the inclusion of Iran in President George W Bush’s infamous axis of evil list. No one, it seems, is sure how the phrase “axis of evil” made it into the final speech. Its original author put it in with the expectation it would be taken out. Similarly, Straw thinks Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran is another, though more wilful, mistake. Yet it has to be said that the Iranian leadership, under Khamenei, do little to encourage confidence in their actions. They have been playing a game of brinkmanship for many decades that stems in part from fear of foreign meddling but also anxiety about domestic change. It is this tension that goes to the heart of a nation divided between public pretence and private interests. In 2011, members of the Basij – the group who tried to intimidate Straw on his Iran trip – ransacked compounds belonging to the British embassy. They smashed almost everything they could, except for one thing: bottles of alcohol, which they stole. Like the nuclear material that Iran is currently processing, that kind of hypocrisy has a dangerous half-life. Perhaps all that’s preventing a popular uprising is the nationalism fuelled by American hostility.

He made the comment in an interview with the BBC (see 6.09pm) as the changes, which would require leadership candidates to have the support of 20% of MPs, instead of 10% as now, were being debated by delegates. A card vote was taken, and the results will be announced later, but Unison is backing the changes, which should significantly boost their chances of being passed. (See 3.41pm.) A win would go some way towards compensating Sir Keir Starmer for the humiliation of having to ditch a more significant part of his original proposal – a return to the original electoral college, under which MPs get a third of the votes in leadership contests. All aspects of his plan have been opposed by the left, which sees them as moves that would prevent the election of another Jeremy Corbyn-type candidate. Starmer has said a Labour government would not seek to nationalise the big six energy companies, apparently ditching a leadership campaign pledge to “support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water”. He made the comment in a wide-ranging interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr. See 11.01am. A few hours after the interview, delegates voted for a green new deal motion backing “public ownership of energy including energy companies”, but Starmer’s aides have indicated that he is willing to ignore this when drafting the next manifesto. Starmer has expressed his disapproval of his deputy, Angela Rayner, calling the Tories “scum” – but he did not directly call for her to apologise. (See 11.00am.) Sajid Javid, the Tory health secretary, has claimed that Starmer is not fit to run the NHS because, in response to a question about trans rights, Starmer said it was not right to say that only women have a cervix. (See 3.27pm.) Labour is spending more than £2m on legal fees every year in the aftermath of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, a senior party official has claimed. Jeremy Corbyn saw a Labour conference fringe event on the climate emergency disrupted by his brother Piers, who protested by shouting and handing out climate science-denying leaflets. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has been speaking at a Labour fringe. As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, he has been setting out his own policy agenda. Delegates held a card vote on the party rule changes. They have been divided into four parts, all subject to a separate vote: the EHRC-related changes; other disciplinary changes; party conference changes; and “Getting Labour election ready”, the term used to describe the changes to the leadership election rules. It takes a while to count card votes, and so the results are not expected to be known until later tonight. The main conference proceedings have now wrapped up for the day. In the conference delegates have voted by hand for a national executive committee statement calling for the creation of an NEC working group to look at future changes to the party rules. This is all that survives of the original plan to get rid of the electoral college. The statement says: As part of the NEC’s key function to win elections and maintain the support of voters, the NEC supports the establishment of an NEC working group to look at future amendments that may be made to the party’s rules so that political levy members may have a say in the party as it delivers on winning the next election and considers how to involve Labour elected members from the Scottish parliament, the Senedd and local government. As part of its work, the NEC working group will also consider methods of promoting diversity and representation, including ensuring women’s representation in any election. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has told the BBC that he does not favour the leadership election changes, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Shabana Mahmood, the national campaign coordinator, is wrapping up the debate. She says the leadership election rules changes are “a strong package of reforms that will better connect us with working people”. She says they will ensure that any candidate has a sufficient basis of support in the party. If you cannot persuade one fifth of MPs to make you a leadership candidate, “then you will struggle to persuade the people of this country to make you their prime minister,” she says. Addressing the concerns about the impact of these changes on diversity, she says As an ethnic minority MP, she says the MPs subject to trigger ballots under the old system were women. She also says she objects to the idea that MPs are not similar to members. And she says more than half of Labour MPs are now female. The idea that they will only deliver candidates who are male, pale and stale is wrong, she says. She says she regrets that she had to spend the summer of 2019 fighting a reselection battle. She would have preferred to spend the summer talking to voters, she says. The Unite union will not be voting on the leadership election rule changes, it has confirmed. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, says the FBU will be opposing the leadership election rule changes. He says they privilege MPs, and he says the idea that it will make the party more appealing to voters is unconvincing. He also said that the unions had not been properly consulted on the change. James McAsh, a delegate from Camberwell and Peckham, says if the 20% threshold were in place in the 1990s, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett would not have been able to stand for the leadership. Ed Balls, Diane Abbott and Andy Burnham would have been excluded in 2010, he says. And he says if the same rule had applied after the 2019 election defeat, Keir Starmer would have been the only candidate. He says with this rule change, candidates will be paler, maler and staler. Back in the debate Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, is defending the plans on behalf of the national executive committee. He says MPs must have the support of their local members. But the current rules mean they can be forced to fight a reselection battle even if most members back them. And he says lifting the nomination threshold for a leadership candidate to 20% of MPs means a candidate must have the support of around 40 MPs. That is the minimum number needed for a viable shadow cabinet, he says. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says that, although he thinks Angela Rayner is impressive, progressive parties will not win elections if people think they are sanctimonious. Ian Drummond, a delegate from Edinburgh Eastern, says these changes will bake in everything happening in the party that he opposes. He says he does not believe that anyone is looking at the party and saying, if only it became more democratic, they would be more likely to vote for it. Helena Dollimore, a delegate from Mitcham and Morden, says Labour is at its best when it is out in the community, not facing inwards. In 2015 even a Tory MP joined the party to vote for the new leader, under the registered supporters scheme. She says it is time to change that. She says she was in primary school the last time Labour won an election. These rule changes will put Labour “in pole position” for the next election, she claims. Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU union, says it is wrong to say the unions have been consulted about these changes. He says that if he had been consulted, he would have said they were being “bounced”. He suggests the plans should be postponed. Wendy Nichols, chair of the national executive committee’s organisation sub-committee, is now opening the debate on the other rule changes, including the ones that relate to leadership elections. These ones are summarised by the leadership with the title “Getting Labour election-ready”. Shabana Mahmood, the national campaign coordinator, is now summing up for the NEC. She says this a robust package that addresses the demands of the EHRC. She says it has not been rushed. There will be no hierarchy of discrimination, she says. All protected characteristics will be covered. She says the antisemitism problem marked a “shameful period” in the party’s history. They want to ensure no community goes through this pain again, she says. Back in the hall Judi Billing, a Labour councillor, says she is sick of Jewish members having to sit in the conference hall “feeling tense and scared”, as she has done in recent years. She says she is the daughter of a refugee from Hitler’s Berlin, and she grew up in Paddington with Windrush families. She says that at that time the one thing she knew was that if you wanted to fight racism, you should get involved with Labour. At a fringe meeting at the Labour conference earlier, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester and a former health secretary, said the promised Covid inquiry would show the need for British society to be “completely rewired”. He said it would “reveal how our country is run” and show “some of the worst traits of that Whitehall and Westminster system”. He went on: It will tell you about ministers too close to the private sector, ministers too close to newspapers. It will tell you about local government being completely disregarded, ridden roughshod over. It will tell you about the north of England crying out for help, being absolutely brushed aside. It will tell you all the things that are wrong with the way this country is run. Britain needs to be completely rewired, there needs to be much more power taken out of Westminster and Whitehall and given to people at the local level, so that the pandemic response could have been run properly from that local level. Back in the debate Paul Shaverin, a delegate from Enfield Southgate, says there were people at the conference laughing yesterday when antisemitism was mentioned. He says, as a Jew, he had to respond to friends who asked why he remained in the party. He says he wants to be able to go home after this conference and tell them the problem has been solved. Momentum is urging its supporters to vote against the EHRC-related rule changes, LabourList’s Sienna Rodgers reports. The Labour MP Ruth Smeeth welcomed the proposed rule changes. She said the racists tried to force Jews out of the Labour party, but they failed. She said: It breaks my heart that racists thought they had a place in the Labour Party, that Jewish members, usually women, were threatened, abused and bullied every day not by the BNP or the EDL but by those who claimed to share our values. These racists tried to break Jewish members, to hound us out of our party and to scare us into silence. Well conference, I have news for them: you failed. We’re still here, JLM [Jewish Labour Movement] is still here, and today we need to send a message to the vile racists and bullies who thought that our party could become a home for Jew hate. Margaret Hodge, another MP, said today’s rule changes really matter. They would ensure that never again would the party become a hostile environment for Jews, she said. In his speech at the end of the transport debate, Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said his father was a truck driver. He criticised the government for not doing enough to make HGV driving jobs attractive. He said: The truth is, the Tories have failed to value good working-class jobs. They have failed to invest in those jobs and now we are all paying the price. We have a 90,000 HGV driver shortage, leaving supermarket shelves empty and businesses without vital supplies. And it’s only going to get worse. Just 3% of the 320,000 drivers in the UK are women. The number of drivers completing their practical HGV test after their theory is dwindling. The transport secretary’s answer? Pile more pressure on already exhausted existing drivers and cut corners on test. It simply isn’t good enough. This Tory government could and should have done more to attract people to the industry – to value those vital jobs. We’ve warned them – if you don’t act now, shelves will continue to be bare, with medicines not delivered and Christmas ruined for the nation. Wendy Nichols, chair of the national executive committee’s organisation sub-committee, opens the debate. She says the EHRC found the party had acted unlawfully. And she says the party is legally obliged to implement these changes. The debate will come in two parts. The first will deal with rule changes being introduced in response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s report on antisemitism in the party, and the second will deal with the leadership election rule changes. In the conference hall, the debate on the leadership election rules changes is about to start. There was a round of applause as Sir Keir Starmer took a seat on the platform. At the Socialism Wins fringe earlier, John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, claimed that delegates were being turned away from conference because they had been suspended by the party without their knowledge. He said: What I can’t stand is delegates turning up to come and represent their constituencies and being told that they can’t be allowed in because they hadn’t got the email saying they have been suspended. This is insane. Joe Stalin would be over the moon about the way we are behaving at the moment. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, told Radio 4 earlier that she would not describe Tories as scum. Asked about Angela Rayner’s comment (see 8.43am), Nandy said: Angela feels very strongly about what this government is doing, I do as well but that’s not the way that I would choose to articulate my anger. The way that I think we best respond to this actually is to prove to the people of this country that we’re an alternative not just an opposition to the government. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, has criticised Unison, his union, for its decision to back Sir Keir Starmer in the vote on the changes to the leadership election rules. (See 3.41pm.) Sir Keir Starmer has had a significant boost to his plans to overhaul leadership rules after sources said the Unison delegation had backed the plans. Momentum had briefed that they believed they could defeat the rule changes – and humiliate Starmer – if Unison abstained in the vote. The trade union has a significant number of votes on the conference floor and had been rumoured to be considering abstention. Unison had deferred the decision to its delegates, who decided on Sunday afternoon that it would back the changes to both leadership elections and trigger ballots, which are the rules around the deselection of MPs. Shadow cabinet ministers will be dispatched onto the conference floor this afternoon to personally lobby conference delegates to vote in favour of Starmer’s rule changes. One shadow cabinet minister said a large number of the Labour party delegates, who represent ordinary members, were persuadable and did not belong to a particular faction. The conference will vote on rule changes including raising the threshold of MPs required to nominate leadership candidates – the most controversial measure – but also making it harder to deselect MPs and on new disciplinary rules in the wake of the EHRC report into antisemitism. Speeches are set to begin on the conference floor at around 4pm and votes scheduled for 5.20pm, though results are expected to come later on. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, says he had to queue for two hours early this morning to get petrol. He is blaming Brexit. Jamie Driscoll, the Labour mayor for North of Tyne, has written an article for LabourList saying “there is no route to a Labour government without going big and bold on the green new deal”. He goes on: Not gestures, but big enough to deal with the problem. Retrofit every home. Zero-carbon, low-cost public transport. A grid powered by 100% clean energy, and a complete replacement of fossil fuels. Matched by the radicalism to devolve this to nations, regions and local authorities around the country. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has condemned Sir Keir Starmer for saying this morning people should not say only women have a cervix. (See 11.01am.) See 2.28pm for a more nuanced take. Bell Ribeiro-Addy has joined other leftwing MPs in urging delegates to vote against the proposed changes to the leadership election rules being debated this afternoon. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, took a fresh swipe at the essay on Labour’s future published by Sir Keir Starmer a few days ago, LabourList reports. UPDATE: Here is McDonnell’s quote. I have read the 11,500 words. We were told it was 14,000 words - so there is 2,500 missing. That must be where the politics was. The rest of it is banality after banality. It really is. My colleague Rowena Mason has more on Piers Corbyn disrupting the event where his own brother was speaking. (See 2.36pm.) Lucy Powell, the shadow housing secretary, opened the afternoon debate at the conference, on housing and transport. Here are the main points from her speech. Powell said Labour was the party of “home-owners and tenants”, while the Tories were “the party of speculators and developers”. She claimed that Labour plans to give councils greater power over housing could enable another 100,000 new homes to be built a year. She said: For too long, speculators and developers have held most of the cards – ducking minimal commitments, extracting huge value from the public for land, and doing too little for first time buyers and local people. That’s why Labour will give local authorities new powers to buy and develop land for housing, and revitalise town centres, by reforming arcane compensation rules. This could generate up to 100,000 new homes a year, much of which social and affordable. She said Labour would set a new definition of affordable housing, linked to local wages. She also said that Labour would promote home ownership, and that “central to this is bold action on restoring the link between wages and housing costs”. But she said little about how this might be achieved. She said Labour would stop foreign investors buying up large swathes of new developments. She said: We will give first time buyers first dibs on new developments, and put an end to the outrageous practise of foreign hedge funds purchasing swathes of new homes, off plan. She said Labour would legislate to stop leaseholders having to pay to remove Grenfell-style cladding deemed unsafe. Jeremy Corbyn’s event has been disrupted by his own brother, Piers, the anti-lockdown campaigner. The row broke out after Piers Corbyn and another man stood up to try to ask a question. The moderator asked for questions from women and people of colour only, which sparked the male audience member to start shouting, leading to his removal from the room. Piers Corbyn, wearing a “Resist! Defy!” T-shirt, shouted, accusing the event organisers of assault, while Jeremy Corbyn looked on impassively. These are from my Observer colleague Sonia Sodha, on how she thinks Sir Keir Starmer should have responded to Andrew Marr’s question this morning about people with a cervix. (See 11.01am.) These are from my colleague Jessica Elgot, who’s been at the Labour First fringe meeting. Labour First represents what it describes as moderates in the party. Those on the left would call them centrists, rightwingers or Blairites. Jeremy Corbyn has drawn a crowd of hundreds in a big tent at the World Transformed festival outside Labour conference. Delegates whooped as he laid into main conference – and by implication Keir Starmer – for debating “unnecessary ... rule changes” instead of focusing on the climate emergency. He went on to talk about the environment as a class issue, saying a move to a green economic revolution must not mean mass loss of jobs in old industry. Keir Starmer denies Labour would renationalise energy firms – video Momentum, the Labour group set up when Jeremy Corbyn was leader to support him and his agenda, has welcomed the vote in favour of the green new deal 1 composite. (See 1.20pm.) Gaya Sriskanthan, the Momentum co-chair, said: This is a turning point. The grassroots have had enough of timid centrism and have overwhelmingly endorsed transformative socialist policy that meets the crises of the 21st century head on. From the public ownership of the energy sector to the creation of a national care service and millions of green jobs, this motion gives us a clear vision of what a just transition under a Labour government would look like. And the Labour for a Green New Deal also welcomed the result. Chris Saltmarsh, the co-founder of the campaign, said: Despite efforts to block this motion and stifle party democracy, members have demonstrated the strength of support for a transformative climate agenda. Despite his promise to create a more democratic culture, Starmer is alienating himself from ordinary members. He should re-state the ambitious pledges of his leadership campaign, and put the green new deal at the heart of his agenda. This result shows that there is huge support for a radical agenda in the Labour party, and that he membership and affiliated unions are united in their support for transformative politics. Starmer should recognise this, re-state the ambitious pledges of his leadership campaign, and put the green new deal at the heart of his leadership. Labour has now published details of its plans to change the curriculum, and other aspects of how schools are run, to ensure that pupils leave school “job-ready and life-ready”. The plans include reforming citizenship education so that pupils learn about things like pensions, credit score and mortgages; making work experience compulsory for two weeks; teaching all pupils functional computer skills; and giving pupils more access to extra-curricular activities through the 10 by 10 pledge. Commenting on the plans, Sir Keir Starmer said: Every child should leave education ready for work and ready for life. Employers all around the country, in every sector, have told me how much they need well-rounded young people with relevant skills, literate in technology, equipped for life. And young people have told me how ambitious they are for their own futures. That’s why Labour would create an education system that would give every child the skills for the future. Jo Stevens, the shadow culture minister, was the final speaker in the morning’s debate. Here are the main points from her speech. Stevens said Labour would use a healthy living index to ensure government policy changes take into account wellbeing. She said: Labour’s healthy living index would ensure that every government decision would have to improve wellbeing, just as the Office for Budget Responsibility tracks government spending. A healthy and happy life is a right that Labour will fight for. Everyone should have the opportunity of both good quality work and good quality leisure. She criticised the government for not using the online safety bill to protect people from online fraud. She explained: The epidemic of online fraud and scams continues. More than £2.3bn lost by victims in England, Wales and Northern Ireland last year. But the government refuses to include protection for people in the bill. Financial campaigner Martin Lewis has called for it, victims, City of London Police and the FCA have too, but the Conservatives say no. Well Labour will do what the Tory government won’t. We’ll fight inside and outside parliament for better legislation that protects the public against the fraudsters and scammers, that forces a proper duty of care on social media companies about what they host on their platforms and unlike the government, we’ll fight for criminal penalties for senior tech executives who repeatedly breach the new law. She said Labour would get a new agreement with the EU to allow British musicians to tour easily on the continent. At the end of the morning conference session, delegates voted on five composite motion. Four of them were passed on a show of hands, but the fifth went to card vote because it was close, meaning the result will not be announced until later. Of the motions that were passed, the green new deal 1 composite is probably the one that has attracted most attention. It backs a “socialist green new deal that will shift power from capital into the hands of workers” and advocates “public ownership of energy including energy companies, creating an integrated, democratic system”. The extensive motion also calls for the repeal of all anti-trade union laws, and for the creation of a national climate service to tackle the climate crisis. Although Labour conference votes in theory determine party policy, in practice what matters is what gets included in the manifesto and sometimes the leadership does ignore conference votes. A second composite motion passed this morning, on public ownership, calls for the Royal Mail to be returned to public ownership. It says “the case for extending democratic public ownership in the post-Covid economy could not be clearer”. But this morning Sir Keir Starmer suggested he was only in favour of further nationalisations where this would be “pragmatic”. (See 11.01am.) His interview was almost certainly a better guide to the next Labour manifesto than the voting this morning, and Starmer’s team don’t seem too bothered by the motions being passed. The other motions that were passed covered the community wealth building agenda and high street regeneration. The card vote is on the green new deal 2 composite, which overlaps a lot with the first one but also calls for more nuclear power stations. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary when Jeremy Corbyn was party leader, has also accused Sir Keir Starmer of going back on a promise he made during the Labour leadership contest to nationalise the energy companies. Here are two tweets critical of Sir Keir Starmer’s response in his Marr interview to the question about Angela Rayner’s “scum” comment. From Iain Dale, the broadcaster and former Tory adviser From my colleague Rafael Behr Liam Fox, the Conservative former international trade secretary, has joined those Tories who have already criticised Angela Rayner for calling them “scum”. This is from my Guardian colleague Owen Jones, one of the most prominent commentators on the Labour left. Back in the conference hall Aden Harris, a delegate from Filton and Bradley Stoke CLP, has just delivered one of the most stirring speeches of the morning. It included this rebuke to Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, who told the Sunday Times she did not believe in the magic money tree. He said: And yes, Rachel Reeves, there is a money tree. It’s called the top 1%. So let’s tax them. It is a forest, it a forest, we will tax them, and we will save this planet. It can be done and we will do it. Harris said taxing the top 1% of earners would fund a radical green new deal. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who represents Aberavon in south Wales, has welcomed Ed Miliband’s announcement about a £3bn green transition fund for the steel industry. (See 11.39am.) He said: Our steelworkers make the best steel that money can buy, but for a decade they’ve been held back and let down by Conservative governments that have refused to bring forward the policies that are needed to enable our steel industry to compete on a level playing field. Labour’s £3 billion steel renewal fund will change the game, completely. It will ensure a just transition to cleaner, greener production methods by sustaining and creating highly skilled steel jobs and strengthening proud steel communities like the one in my Aberavon constituency. In the conference debate on the green new deal, Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said that for his members the climate crisis was already an industrial issue. He said: Conference, we see the climate catastrophe unfolding in front of our eyes every single day. Floods in Belgium and Germany that cost hundreds of lives. Wildfires across most of Europe. We see the climate catastrophe exposing the inequalities in society across the world. Workers killed in flash floods in unlawful basement flat apartments in New York City – one of the richest cities in the world. For us, in our union, this is already an industrial issue. Our members are out there tackling the impact of the climate catastrophe, here and now, and it has been growing over the past 20 years. I will give one example, which I used before but I don’t apologise: every year, colleagues of ours in the United States are killed doing their job. Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader, has posted a message on Twitter confirming his opposition to the proposed rule changes being debated this afternoon that would require a leadership candidate to be nominated by at least 20% of Labour MPs. When Corbyn was elected leader in 2015, the threshold was 15%. Subsequently it was reduced to 10%, in what was seen as a move to increase the chances of a leftwing candidate being able to enter a future contest. Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to raise it to 20% is seen as a move to achieve the opposite, and to Corbyn-proof the Labour leadership election process. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, opened his speech by saying that the last time he addressed conference he was party leader. And he started by suggesting that, although he may have lost the 2015 general election, he felt vindicated. Remember David Cameron’s warning. “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Didn’t work out so well for him, did it? Or more to the point for the country. Instability? Weak government? Chaos? Friends, I didn’t get everything right. But I’ll tell you one thing: I’d have done a damn sight better than this miserable shower. Miliband also said that, although his main opponents from the 2010-15 era were now gone from frontline politics – David Cameron, Nick Clegg and George Osborne – he had come back to the shadow cabinet because he was passionate about tackling the climate crisis. In his speech, he announced a plan for £3bn programme to help the steel industry go green, over 10 years. He also said Labour wanted to implement a green new deal, and that part of this would involve creating “a green Britain where public and alternative models of ownership play their proper role in making the transition affordable, secure and fair”. This line received sustained applause, although it was not clear whether or not this was evidence of delegates pushing back against Sir Keir Starmer burying full nationalisation of the main energy companies as an option in his Marr interview. (See 11.01am.) The interview was was awkward for Miliband because only recently he told Newsnight that Labour remained committed to nationalising the energy companies. “We haven’t changed that commitment,” he told the programme. “If we’re going to make this green transition, then public ownership is the right way to go.” Here are the main points from Sir Keir Starmer’s interview with Andrew Marr. Starmer ruled out nationalising the big six energy companies. Asked if he would do this, at first he said the immediate problem was to secure supply. But when asked again if would nationalise them, he replied: “No.” When it was put to him that when running for the Labour leadership he did propose nationalising them as one of his 10 principles, he told Marr that nationalisation was not the same as common ownership. He also said it was important to be pragmatic. He said: I’d be pragmatic about it, and where common ownership is value for money for the taxpayer and delivers better services then there should be common ownership. He cited test and trace as an example of a service that should have been under common ownership. In the 10 pledges document issued during the Labour leadership contest, Starmer said: Public services should be in public hands, not making profits for shareholders. Support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water. He expressed his disapproval of his deputy, Angela Rayner, calling the Tories “scum” – but did not directly call for her to apologise. Asked about her comment, he said: Angela and I take different approaches and that’s not language that I would use. Asked if she should apologise, he said: That’s a matter for Angela … but I would not have used those words. I will talk to Angela about it later on. He suggested the government might have to grant visas to 100,000 foreign lorry drivers, not just the 5,000 planned by ministers. He said: On the HGV situation we are going to have to bring in more drivers and more visas. I’m astonished the government, knowing the situation, is not acting today. The prime minister needs to say today what he is going to do. Asked if he would bring in 100,000 foreign drivers, Starmer said: We are going to have to do that. We have to issue enough visas to cover the number of drivers that we need. He said he was “very happy” with the outcome of the internal Labour debate on his proposed changes to party leadership election rules. His decision to withdraw his plans to bring back the electoral college, because of union opposition, has been described as an embarrassing defeat. (See 8.40am.) But Starmer claimed he did not see it that way. He said: By the way, I’m very happy with the situation we’re in now because I’ve got a package of alternatives that does what I wanted them to do, which is to ensure that the Labour party can focus on the country and some of those rules were holding us back. So I’m very happy with the situation we find ourselves in. It’s a strong package … There’s almost nobody in the Labour party who doesn’t say we need to change the rules. What people have been saying is that it would be better to delay it. I think to delay it and not take a difficult decision is weakness. I think strong leadership requires tough decisions to be taken, and to be taken quickly … I would rather take three days of arguing about rule changes and get them through than do what everyone else is saying, which is put it off for another 12 months. The last thing I want is another 12 months arguing about these rules. He rejected claims that as leader he needed to be more of a “showman”, able to engage with voters emotionally. He said people saying that thought he should be more like Boris Johnson. He went on: It’s priced in, apparently, that [Johnson] is dishonest. Just stop there and ask ourselves: do we want our politics, and our political leaders and our prime minster to be of a characteristic where they are untrustworthy, and where it’s priced in. I’m different, I’m afraid. I believe in integrity, I believe in truth. He cited Mark Drakeford in Wales as an example of how a leader could be successful without “showman” qualities. He did not describe Drakeford as boring (one of the criticisms frequently made of Starmer himself, and a word that has been applied to the Welsh first minister too), but instead he praised Drakeford as “honest, reassuring and transparent”. Starmer said people should not say only women have a cervix. Asked if it was transphobic to say this, he replied: It is something that shouldn’t be said. It is not right. But, when pressed to explain why he took this view, he did not elaborated but instead said: “We do everybody a disservice when we reduce what is a really important issue to these exchanges on particular things that are said.” He said he wanted to see a “mature, respectful debate about trans rights” and he said the trans community was “the most marginalised and abused” of many communities. He also said that it would have been safe for Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP, to attend conference. Duffield is staying away because of the controversy generated by her remarks on trans issues, which have included liking a tweet saying women were people with a cervix. He said Labour has no plans to raise income tax. When Marr put it to him that Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, told the Sunday Times that the party was not going to raise income tax, Starmer said Reeves said the party was not currently considering an income tax rise. Starmer’s account of the interview (paywall) is correct. Reeves told the paper: “I don’t have any plans to increase the rates of income tax.” Here is my colleague Heather Starmer’s story about Sir Keir Starmer ruling out nationalising the big six energy companies in his Andrew Marr interview. This is from my colleague Rafael Behr on Sir Keir Starmer’s Andrew Marr interview. Q: What do you say to people who argue that what Labour needs is a leader who is a showman, and who is more emotional? Starmer says people say that about Boris Johnson. People know he is untrustworthy, but they say that is priced in. Do we really want that for the country, he asks. He says Mark Drakeford in Wales shows how an alternative model of leadership work. Q: What do you say to people who say you should stand aside for someone else? Starmer says he will be setting out his platform in his speech on Wednesday. And that’s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary soon. Starmer says he is “happy” with the leadership election reforms being voted on. He says delaying a decision would have been a sign of weakness. Taking decisions is “strong leadership”, he says. He says it is better to spend three days having an argument and getting this sorted out than to duck the issue. Q: Should Angela Rayner apologise for calling the Tories scum. Starmer says he would not have used those words. Q: Should she apologise? Starmer says that is a matter for her. Q: Are women only people with a cervix? Starmer says he wants to see a mature, respectful debate about trans rights. He says he spoke to Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP who has attracted strong criticism for backing the view that women are people with a cervix. He says she would have been welcome at the conference. Pressed again on the cervix question, he says this debate should not be reduced to simple questions. Q: Will you nationalise the big six energy companies? Starmer says the immediate issue is how to get through the winter. Q: Will you nationalise the big six companies? No, says Starmer, Q: But in your 10 principles, when you stood for the leadership, you said these companies should be under common ownership. Starmer says common ownership is not the same as nationalisation. He says he wants to be pragmatic. Q: Ed Miliband said on Newsnight recently that this would mean nationalisation. Starmer says where common ownership provides values for the taxpayer, and provides a better service, he is in favour of it. He cites track and trace as an example. He says it cost £37bn, but would have been better off in the public sector. Q: Would you put up taxes for income from shares? Starmer says they will not unfairly tax working families. Q: Would you repeal the national insurance hike? Starmer says it was the wrong thing to do? Q: Would you repeal it? Starmer says it is an unfair tax. He says Labour’s view is that those with the broadest shoulders should pay. Q: Rachel Reeves says today you would not put up income tax. Starmer says Reeves said they are not considering putting up income tax. She has set out new fiscal rules. They are looking at tax, he says. Q: This sounds like free movement. Starmer says it sounds like lack of planning by the government. Andrew Marr starts by asking Sir Keir Starmer about the lorry driver crisis. Starmer says this problem has been known about for a long time. He says the government, when it left the EU, should have prepared a back-up plan. He says another 5,000 visas for foreign drivers will not be enough. Q: So would you let in 100,000 – the number of drivers the UK is short of? Starmer suggests the government might have to. He says 5,000 will not be enough. The problem will last until Christmas, he says. And he says the army cannot be brought in over the long term. This is from the Labour backbencher Steve McCabe, pointing out that Angela Rayner is not the only MP in trouble this weekend over a remark deemed offensive. This is what Angela Rayner told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday about why she called the Tories “scum” at a meeting last night. She said: Anyone who leaves children hungry during a pandemic and can give billions of pounds to their mates on WhatsApp, I think that was pretty scummy. Now that is a phrase, and let me contextualise it, it’s a phrase that you would hear very often in northern working-class towns. We’d even say it jovially to other people. And that to me is my street language … I’m not saying that anyone who voted for Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic … I’m saying the prime minister has said those things and has acted in that way … If the prime minister wants to apologise, and remove himself from those comments that he’s made that are homophobic that racist, that are misogynistic, then I will apologise for calling him scummy. Asked about Angela Rayner’s “scum” comment, McDonnell says “we’ve all been there, late at night”. He says he likes the way Rayner sounds like an ordinary person. He says sometimes people do not get their language right. But people will forgive them if they understanding their motives, he says. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, is being interviewed on Sky News. He says he thinks it will be “touch and go” whether the watered-down changes to the party leadership rules being debated this afternoon pass. He says he is not in favour himself. I don’t think actually we need a change in the rule, but if it goes through, to be honest, we’ll work with it, it won’t prevent a left-winger coming forward, as far as I’m concerned. But I don’t think it’s necessary and I would oppose it this morning if I had a vote, definitely. Asked if he thinks the proposal reflects the fact that the leadership does not trust the membership, McDonnell agrees. He says some people do not trust party democracy. UPDATE: McDonnell said: I think there are some people - maybe around Keir as well, I don’t think it’s Keir himself - who have a pathological fear of our members. Trust the people. Don’t have your shenanigans where you’re trying to restrict the role of members. In fact, when Keir stood for leader he said he was going to engage with members more and members would have more of a role - that’s why people feel this is a bit of a step backwards and he hasn’t been really straight. Rayner says she considers Starmer feminist. She says during the Covid crisis Starmer discussed with her making arrangements for her to take over if he fell ill. That was a sign of respect for her status and role, she says. Q: How can women trust Labour when the Labour MP Rosie Duffield does not feel safe to come to conference? Rayner says the abuse the Duffield has faced is “completely unacceptable”. She says the MP has her full support. Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, is being interviewed on Sky. Q: Did Sir Keir Starmer talk to you in advance about his proposed rule changes? Yes, says Rayner. And she says he spoke to the unions too. Q: So you did not agree, because you proposed a separate plan to the national executive committee? Rayner says she will not discuss private conversations, but she says she wanted to make sure the rule changes did not stop a broad selection of candidates being on the ballot. Q: How can people believe you and Starmer are together when you cannot agree? Rayner says they did agree. Her amendment was a friendly amendment to ensure that they did achieve the goal both she and Starmer wanted. Q: Margaret Beckett yesterday talked about civility. So did David Evans, the general secretary. You called the Tories last night “a bunch of scum”. Is that the kind of civility the Starmer/Rayner party envisages? Rayner says that was “post-watershed”, to some activists. She says the PM has said racist and homophobic things, and he has wasted money by contracts for mates. She says she was speaking to activists to get “fire in their belly”. She says when she was young the Tories said women like her got pregnant just to get a council house. And she says the PM has not apologised for what he said about Muslim women. Q: But you were talking about a bunch of them. Rayner says cabinet ministers are involved in what the government has done. She cites Priti Patel. She says to leave children hungry during the pandemic is “a scummy thing to do”. That is “street language”, she says. Q: Are you saying people who vote Tory are scum? No, says Rayner. She says she is not saying that. Q: Will you apologise to the PM for calling him scum? Rayner says she will if the PM apologises for the racist things he has said. Good morning. It is the first full day of the Labour conference in Brighton, and so far it is not going well. Here is the Observer splash by my colleagues Toby Helm and Michael Savage. And here is an extract. Keir Starmer is battling to restore authority over the Labour party after a bruising defeat at the hands of unions and the left sparked a storm of criticism over his performance as leader. Ahead of a conference billed as the moment when Starmer would introduce himself as a future prime minister to the British people, the Labour leader on Saturday was forced to withdraw plans to limit the role of party members, and increase that of MPs, in selecting future party leaders, after the unions united in opposition to block the move … Starmer loyalists tried to talk up the leader’s success in forcing through other reforms that would make it more difficult for hard-left activists to deselect Labour MPs. “He has locked out the hard left. This is a major achievement,” said one frontbencher. But there was widespread dismay in all wings of the party over the way Labour had been plunged into more divisive internal arguments just at the point when it had hoped to train its guns on the Tories and present its leader as a future occupant of No 10 … Anger at Starmer’s misjudgment over the leadership rule changes has seriously dented morale, even among shadow ministers who see themselves as scrupulously loyal. “This is a total disaster,” one member of the frontbench said. Still, things can only get better, as they used to say at these events. Here are some of the other Labour conference stories around this morning. Starmer says Labour would end charitable status for private schools, forcing them to pay an extra £1.7bn in tax, the Sunday Mirror reports. The money would be used to improve state schools, including by offering better citizenship education. Starmer told the paper: Employers in every sector told me how much they need well-rounded young people with relevant skills and literate in technology. And young people have told me how ambitious they are for their own futures.” Labour’s reforms would mean every child having a laptop at home. To ensure teenagers are fit for jobs, two weeks’ work experience would be compulsory. And to prepare for the real world, statutory citizenship courses would include pension planning, mortgage applications, and understanding credit ratings and employment and rental contracts. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, has used an article in the Observer to say “people have been left without knowing what or who the party stands for” under Starmer. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has told the Sunday Times (paywall) that she does not believe in a magic money rules and that Labour would apply its own fiscal rules. In their write-up of the interview, Tim Shipman and Caroline Wheeler report: A Labour government would balance day-to-day government spending, but allow itself to borrow for capital investment. Crucially, it would be committed to reducing the national debt as a proportion of national income. Going into the 2008 financial crisis it was 38 per cent of the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP), rising to 60 per cent when Labour left office in 2010. By the start of the Covid crisis it was 80 per cent and now it has hit 98 per cent of GDP … Reeves has two further rules which will give her more wriggle room: Labour would take government assets into account when examining the books, which would deter the sell-off of assets that make a return for the taxpayer, a move that has the backing of the new OBR boss Richard Hughes. (This she is keen for us to know “means it isn’t mad”). Finally, the OBR could declare a crisis situation where all the rules are suspended for a period. Reeves argues that it is important to work such a scenario into the rules so unexpected events do not simply lead to them being torn up. “It will be up to the OBR, not to the government, to say we’re in a crisis,” she explains. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, has been criticised by the Conservatives after describing them as “a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic” at a conference event. Len McCluskey, the former Unite general secretary, has said at a conference event it is “almost impossible” for Labour to win the next election, the Sunday Telegraph reports. Here is the main agenda for the day. 8.30am: Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, is interviewed on Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Other guests include John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, and Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary. After 9am: Sir Keir Starmer is interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. 9.50am: The conference opens. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, opens a debate on the environment and the green new deal. 12.25pm: Jo Stevens, the shadow culture secretary, speaks to the conference. Lunchtime: Jeremy Corbyn, the former party leader, is due to speak at lunchtime fringe events 2.15pm: Lucy Powell, the shadow housing secretary, opens a debate on housing and transport. 4.10pm: Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, speaks to the conference. 4.20pm: Delegates begin a debate on party rule changes, including requiring leadership candidates to be nominated by 20% of MPs, not 10% as now, and changes to the way disciplinary complaints are investigated (a response to criticism of the party by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission). I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

Ministers revealed on Thursday that Brexit would involve the UK leaving Euratom, which promotes research into nuclear power and uniform safety standards. The news poses problems for the Hinkley Point C station in Somerset, while raising questions over safety inspection regimes and the UK’s future participation in nuclear fusion research. “Leaving Euratom is a lose-lose for everyone. For nuclear proponents, the industry becomes less competitive – and for nuclear critics, safety regulation diminishes,” said Dr Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College London. Referring to Hinkley and other nuclear projects in the pipeline, he said: “The UK nuclear industry is critically dependent on European goods and services in the nuclear supply chain and their specialist nuclear skills. Leaving Euratom will inevitably increas nuclear costs and will mean further delays. EDF, which is building the Hinkley project and hopes to construct other plants, has told MPs that “ideally” the UK would stay in the treaty, as it provided a framework for complying with international standards for handling nuclear material. Without mentioning Hinkley, the French state-owned company also warned that restrictions on the movement of people because of Brexit could delay delivery of new energy infrastructure. Antony Froggatt, a research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “Outside of Euratom and the single market, the movement of nuclear fuel, equipment and trained staff will be more complicated.” He noted that because the UK was a supporter of nuclear power, Brexit would affect the balance of nuclear policies in the EU, where Germany, Italy and even strongly pro-nuclear France had taken steps in recent years to reduce their reliance on atomic power. Vince Zabielski, a nuclear energy specialist at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, said: “If the UK leaves Euratom before new standalone nuclear cooperation treaties are negotiated with France and the US, current new build projects will be placed on hold while those standalone treaties are negotiated.” Other lawyers questioned why the government had decided to quit Euratom and in the manner it had done so, in the explanatory notes accompany the article 50 bill. “There doesn’t seem to have been any real explanation as to why, because we are going towards the unknown at great speed. Legally we don’t have to [leave Euratom because the UK is leaving the EU],” said Jonathan Leech, a senior lawyer and nuclear expert at Prospect Law. “At the moment, the UK standing on the world nuclear stage is predicated on a series of cooperation agreements, and those we have the benefit of from being a member of Euratom, and the few bilateral agreements are based on Euratom, too. Take that away and you have no basis for international nuclear cooperation.” He said quitting Euratom would create unnecessary uncertainty for new nuclear power and research into fusion power, a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission in which the UK has been a world leader for decades. Although the short-term future of the Joint European Torus, a nuclear fusion research centre in Oxfordshire, is guaranteed until 2018, last year’s referendum result and the withdrawal from Euratom puts its longer-term future in doubt. Bernard Bigot, the director of the ITER project, a huge international undertaking to develop nuclear fusion in the south of France, said he believed the UK could still participate in ITER even when it leaves the treaty. “There are several ways for the UK to pursue its participation to ITER within the Brexit policy, if there is political will of the UK and the EU. This could occur either within or outside of the Euratom arrangement,” he said. Leaving Euratom is likely to also add to the workload of the UK’s nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, which is busy assessing designs for Britain’s first Chinese-designed nuclear power plant. “The main burden of the UK leaving Euratom will be the need for it to cover its nuclear non-proliferation safeguards commitment and for this it will have to either set up a separate, independent agency or bring these treaty responsibilities into the Office for Nuclear Regulation,” said John Large, a nuclear consultant. EDF said it had made its view clear on Euratom, and rejected the suggestion that the UK’s withdrawal from the treaty would delay Hinkley Point C. A government spokeswoman said the UK wanted to see a continuity of cooperation and standards. “We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry. Our aim is clear – we want to maintain our mutually successful civil nuclear cooperation with the EU,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/chernobyl-finale-review-when-the-dust-settles-it-will-be-considered-a-classic","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-04T21:10:09Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl finale review – when the dust settles, it will be considered a classic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/chernobyl-finale-review-when-the-dust-settles-it-will-be-considered-a-classic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/chernobyl-finale-review-when-the-dust-settles-it-will-be-considered-a-classic","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl finale review – when the dust settles, it will be considered a classic","bodyText":"A signature of Sky and HBO’s Chernobyl series has been its ability to tell the story of the doomed Soviet power plant through imagery, often with a precision that evokes Andrei Tarkovsky himself. The fifth and final episode is no different. It opens with a slow, ambient montage of sunny Pripyat. Couples stroll in the gardens or swim in the communal pool. Children cavort in the playground. Lyudmilla Ignatenko smiles as her husband, Vasily, plays with their neighbour’s children. We have been taken back in time, 12 hours before the disaster at reactor No 4. As Pripyat blissfully goes about its day, a safety test is planned at Chernobyl HQ. Promotions are promised if everything goes to plan. There is some concern over productivity quotas; Kiev has called to warn there might not be enough power to run the reactor safely. A delay is mooted, but Moscow is expectant. The test will go ahead. Hours later, Vasily will be one of the first responders at the explosion. In Vienna, months after the explosion, Jared Harris’s Valery Legasov – who keeps finding tufts of his hair falling from his scalp – meets with the KGB’s Chairman Charkov. Valery has dutifully engaged in “statecraft” and lied to the gathered scientists. “I think you made an excellent impression at the conference,” Charkov says. Valery, we learn, has entered into a faustian pact. He has told the world what the KGB wanted him to say in return for “assurances” that the remaining reactors will be quietly dealt with. Nothing has been done. But Charkov makes his priorities clear; first, a show trial of Chernobyl’s directors, where Valery must lie again. “We will have our heroes, we will have our villains, we will have our truth,” Charkov says. “After that, we can deal with our reactors.” Chernobyl was the disaster of a state built on the cult of obedience. The final episode, and indeed the series as a whole, has hinged on a single question: can Valery bring himself to tell the truth, even if doing so would be futile and suicidal? When the toxic dust settles on this show, director Johan Renck and screenwriter Craig Mazin will be remembered for crafting a remarkably cogent and multivalent drama, one aided by impeccable performances; Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård and Emily Watson have each never been better. The verisimilitude of the show is exemplary. Many of the characters, such as Lyudmilla and Vasily Ignatenko, are based on testimony given to Svetlana Alexievich for her Nobel prize-winning 1997 book Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster. But Chernobyl has also defined itself by its ability to use genre tropes from other dystopias – which, in turn, were influenced by the event itself. The series has exhibited usages of body horror that David Cronenberg would be proud of. Or there are the slow, foreboding scenes of wind shivering through the trees that feel familiar to George A Romero and the countless zombie horror films he spawned. In this episode, Chernobyl shows itself a dab hand as a courtroom drama, as we switch between the hermetic environs of the trial and the stress of the control room in the hours leading up to the explosion. In doing so, the show allows a wider philosophical question to play out - should the true always be told, regardless of its cost? Is the truth worth it? As London rolls out the red carpet for Donald Trump, it is worth noting Chernobyl’s active focus on the power of the “official truth”. The largest release of nuclear fall-out in the history of humanity was made possible by the lies perpetuated at the highest levels of government, abetted by a media that wilfully engaged in propaganda and the dissemination of false information. It happened because scientific research was dismissed or suppressed when it didn’t fit with the agenda of the authorities. The series rams this point home, and is all the better for it. Is this relevant today? Well, 54 nuclear power plants are currently under construction in 16 countries, with 454 active plants across the world. This is in a time of resurgent nationalist authoritarianism the world over, not to mention the unpredictable weather events and seismic shifts that, thanks to our rapid warming of the climate, are increasing in regularity and scale. Lest we forget, in the course of this decade, Fukushima – a plant in one of most advanced and internationally compliant states in the world – went into meltdown because of a consequence of a freak geological event. Yet the series is also hopeful. It pays homage to the 600,000 people, many of whom, without ever being named or recognised, can legitimately be credited for saving the lives of millions of people. As Tarkovsky did in Stalker, the iconic Russian film that seemed to foretell the disaster, Renck and Mazin have heightened their characters’ stories through the sudden, forensic focus on seemingly happenstance details. In one moment in this final episode, Skarsgård’s Boris Shcherbina pauses to watch a tiny green caterpillar climb up his thumb. It is like a prophecy in itself – amid unimaginable horror, tragedy and decay, nature always has the power to rejuvenate. “Ahhh,” he sighs. “It’s beautiful.” I quite agree. • This article was amended on 6 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the tsunami as a weather event. It was due to a consequence of a geological event. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2019/mar/20/brazilian-drug-gang-opens-fire-on-convoy-of-trucks-carrying-nuclear-fuel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-20T01:34:42Z","webTitle":"Brazilian drug gang opens fire on convoy of trucks carrying nuclear fuel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/20/brazilian-drug-gang-opens-fire-on-convoy-of-trucks-carrying-nuclear-fuel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/mar/20/brazilian-drug-gang-opens-fire-on-convoy-of-trucks-carrying-nuclear-fuel","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian drug gang opens fire on convoy of trucks carrying nuclear fuel","bodyText":"A convoy of trucks carrying nuclear fuel came under armed attack on a highway in Rio de Janeiro state on Tuesday as it drove past a community controlled by a drug gang. Gang members armed with rifles opened fire on the convoy, Rio’s O Globo newspaper said. Armed police escorting the convoy exchanged fire with armed gang members as the trucks carrying uranium continued to a nearby nuclear plant. The attack is the latest of several violent incidents in the area where Brazil has two nuclear reactors and has raised concerns about its nuclear security in a state struggling with high levels of violent crime. The attack happened as the convoy passed the Frade community around noon near the tourist town of Angra dos Reis in the Green Coast (Costa Verde), around 200km from Rio de Janeiro. It reached the Angra 2 nuclear plant less than half an hour later, Brazil’s nuclear agency said. The attack happened in the same area and on the same highway where the British tourist Eloise Dixon was shot and wounded in 2017 after her family’s hire car accidentally drove into another gang-run community, Água Santa. Last year an armed gang blew up two cash machines in a condominium for nuclear workers just a kilometre from the two plants, which provide around 3% of Brazil’s power. Brazil’s government-run nuclear agency Eletronuclear said in a statement the uranium was in a “natural state” and would not have harmed the population as it had the same level of radioactivity as when it is found in nature. Police took position on the edge of the highway when shots were heard at around noon as the convoy passed an area where a gunfight was taking place, Eletronuclear said. The company said the convoy had happened to pass an area where a gunfight was happening and was not attacked. Typically, such convoys have around five or six trucks and are escorted by regular police and motorbike outriders from Brazil’s Federal Highway police, the Eletronuclear spokesman Marco Antonio Alves told the Guardian. It was carrying uranium fuel to supply the Angra 2 nuclear power plant, which began operating in 2001. However, a spokeswoman for the Federal Highway police in Rio said in a statement the convoy had come under fire. “During an escort mission near the Frade community armed individuals opened fire on Federal Highway Police teams, who reacted,” she said. “The escort team continued normally. Nobody was arrested or injured. During the exchange of shots, the criminals let a pistol magazine containing 12 9mm bullets fall, which was seized by the team.” Marco Antonio Alves said the convoy had happened to pass Frade as a gunfight was taking place. “There was a conflict, there was a gunfight in this community called Frade, the police took position and the convoy continued. Some police stayed behind and exchanged shots,” he said. “What happened was a coincidence.” The uranium was being transported from Resende in Rio de Janeiro state where it is fabricated in special metal containers, he said. “We are very worried. Eletronuclear has actioned the federal government for more security. But this is a very complex problem,” he said. In recent years low-income communities around Angra dos Reis like Frade have been taken over by armed drug gangs from Rio de Janeiro, including the notoriously violent Red Command (Comando Vermelho). A rival Rio gang, the Third Pure Command (Terceiro Comando Puro) also disputes some territory with the Red Command. “Frade has a lot of armed vagabonds from Rio,” said Thimoteo de Sá, a retired police lieutenant and councillor from Angra dos Reis who presides over its security commission, adding that the Red Command control the community. “The population of Frade are shaken.” “This region now has a lot of problems it didn’t have a few years ago,” Alves said. “I believe something will change because of this but it is very soon to say what kind of modification will be made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/dec/15/sellafield-thorp-reprocessing-uranium-hazard-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-15T15:59:15Z","webTitle":"Sellafield, former star of the nuclear age, scrubs up for a different future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/15/sellafield-thorp-reprocessing-uranium-hazard-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/dec/15/sellafield-thorp-reprocessing-uranium-hazard-cleanup","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield, former star of the nuclear age, scrubs up for a different future","bodyText":"Deep in the heart of Sellafield, Britain’s biggest nuclear waste site, a small piece of history is playing out. Technicians are about to use a huge amount of force to slice nuclear fuel into thin sheets, so that it can be dissolved in nitric acid, then chemically separated into uranium (for power stations), plutonium and highly radioactive waste. But first they face a computer-says-no moment. Taut minutes pass as on-screen red boxes indicate issues with the shearing machine, which is safely ensconced behind a metre of leaded glass. Finally, the boxes turn green. “Go for it,” says the operator, at which there’s a loud clanking, a white flash on a fuzzy video screen and smiles from staff crowded around. This is the final shear at Sellafield’s thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp), which has halted operations after 24 years it has spent reprocessing more than 9,000 tonnes of fuel from nuclear plants in the UK, Germany and Japan. The facility – which in 2005 experienced one of Sellafield’s worst radioactive leaks – was built in an era of fears over uranium scarcity. Today, however, there is more than enough uranium globally to meet projected demand, so reprocessing no longer makes economic sense. It is an emotional milestone for Thorp’s 450-plus staff, who are facing new, sometimes less prestigious roles, engaged in either winding up the plant or working on decommissioning of the wider site. The scene also marks the start of the endgame for Sellafield, as its focus shifts to a decades-long mission of storing civil and military nuclear waste and gradually cleaning up the 700-hectare site. The site, known to be the most hazardous industrial facility in Europe, dates back to the dawn of the nuclear age. This is where British scientists rushed to develop nuclear weapons during the cold war. The opening here of the world’s first nuclear power station in 1956 was billed as the start of a “new atomic age”. Sellafield sits near Whitehaven on the West Cumbrian coast, cleaved in two by the river Calder. It is extremely congested – to the extent that more and more car parks are being shifted off-site to make space – and has no scope for expansion. Insiders often reach for the metaphor of 3D chess to describe the challenge of removing old and often contaminated infrastructure while building modern facilities to house waste the government hopes will one day be buried deep underground. With 11,000 workers, Sellafield is like a town, with a laundry, hospital, restaurants and its own armed police to protect the stockpile of plutonium, the biggest in the world. The facility eats up two-thirds of the UK’s annual £3bn nuclear clean-up spending. It was outsourced in recent years to a US-led consortium, whose performance was sharply criticised. Management has since returned to the public sector under the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, but that has not stemmed criticism from MPs, who complained in October that Sellafield was nearly £1bn over budget and years behind on projects. The public accounts committee found signs of progress, however, and some are evident. A building called “B30” is considered the most hazardous on the site – and by extension the most hazardous in Europe. It houses a concrete-walled pond open to the elements, and beneath its waters lie skips of waste fuel, dumped in haste half a century ago, and an unknown amount of radioactive sludge. Photographs leaked four years ago showed how degraded the building, one of four such ponds, now was. There had been no plans to remove that waste for decades – but it has now started unexpectedly early, aided by remotely operated underwater vehicles – though these are contaminated in the process and become nuclear waste themselves. The Observer witnessed only the second-ever batch being removed from B30, with a tractor allowed through a gate in the barbed wire-topped three-metre-high fence. Its load was a desk-sized metal box encasing a decades-old skip, probably filled with intermediate- or low-level waste. The hazardous cargo was trundled off to a modern shed, to be dealt with later. Elsewhere in this oldest corner of the site – which resembles a rundown industrial estate – is a US grain-style silo filled with nuclear waste. Huge metal doors have been fitted in its side to allow material to be mechanically removed – but retrieval work is not expected to start until next year. Just metres away, a crane is bringing down an old tower, and workers are using a diamond saw to remove a seven-tonne block of concrete from the top of the building. David Peattie, the NDA’s chief executive, said: “The skyline is changing.” The role the facility plays here in Cumbria is changing, too. With the recent collapse of plans to build a new nuclear power station in the field next door, Sellafield is a vital source of decent, high-paying jobs for the area. One anecdote shared – perhaps apocryphal – is of a local lawyer taking a job in the Sellafield laundry because it was better paid. Tony Lywood, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Copeland, said even with no job losses, the end of reprocessing was a “disaster” for the area because of the changing nature of the work. He also opposes plans to see more future jobs in the private sector supply chain. But Jamie Reed, a former Labour MP who quit two years ago to become head of community relations at Sellafield, said: “Our people have been brilliant. They understand Sellafield is changing. The mission is now clean-up.” • This article was amended on 17 December 2019 to make clear the plutonium from Thorp is civilian grade, not military grade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2020/nov/11/china-tech-shares-slide-beijing-antitrust-alibaba-vaccine-oil-ftse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-11T17:31:41Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 closes at five-month high as vaccine rally continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/nov/11/china-tech-shares-slide-beijing-antitrust-alibaba-vaccine-oil-ftse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/nov/11/china-tech-shares-slide-beijing-antitrust-alibaba-vaccine-oil-ftse-business-live","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 closes at five-month high as vaccine rally continues – as it happened","bodyText":"And finally... Britain’s stock market has closed at a new five-month high tonight. Vaccine optimism continues to lift stocks, despite Christine Lagarde’s cautious words - and concerns that the UK and eurozone economies will suffer from their current lockdowns. With investors continue to pile into shares, the FTSE 100 has closed 85 points up today at 6,382. That’s its eighth daily rise in a row, having rallied sharply since last Monday - the start of the US election week. This week alone, the Footsie has gained a sizzling 8%, lifted first by Joe Biden’s victory and then the news that Pfizer/BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine was proving 90% effective in trials. Goldman Sachs’ prediction that the FTSE will rally to 7200 points by the end of next year (13% higher than today) gave investors another reason to be bullish. Airline group IAG ended the day at the top riser, up 8%, with warehouse operator Segro up 6.7%. Online grocery business Ocado was back in demand too, up 6.3%, as was DIY group Kingfisher and takeaway firm Just Eat. But, some of this week’s star performers did fall back, as traders tried to calculate the impact of a vaccine rollout on the economy. Rolls-Royce dropped 8% (having surged by a staggering 44% on Monday). SSP, which runs cafes and sandwich bars at transport hubs, dipped by 3% on the smaller FTSE 250 where cruise operator Carnival lost 2.6% [they both rallied hard earlier this week]. The pound did also fall back against the US dollar, losing over half a cent to $1.32, which props up multinational share prices. Fawad Razaqzada, analyst with ThinkMarkets, says the London stock market has staged one of its sharpest 3-day rallies in years, on vaccine optimism. The UK index, which had underperformed global and US indices badly since the initial round of lockdowns earlier in the year, has benefited from rotation into value stocks and away from growth and stay-at-home tech plays that had lifted the Nasdaq to repeated all-time highs. Monday’s announcement from Pfizer on the progress made in coronavirus vaccine seems to have been a game changer, even if experts warn that production and distribution may take time. With ongoing central bank and government stimulus providing support, economic recovery could rebound strongly if things go back to normal next year. That’s what the markets are pricing in right now, and ignoring the current economic situation, as a result of the lockdowns and the pandemic. While the FTSE may look a little bit stretched now, it still has a lot of ground to make up on the upside. The path of least resistance is clearly to the upside after it formed a higher high above 6040 on Monday. Now almost 400 points higher, it looks like the bulls will want to target the summer highs circa 6510 and beyond: European markets also ended higher, with the Stoxx 600 at a new eight-month high at the close. On New York, the Nasdaq is still leading the way - up 1.6% as tech stocks recover some of this week’s losses, while the Dow is slightly higher. On that note, goodnight. GW European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde had some cautious words about the pandemic today. Lagarde told the ECB Forum on Central Banking that the eurozone may not experience a ‘linear’ recovery, despite the optimism about Pfizer’s vaccine. There would probably be bumps on the way, depending how fast treatments are rolled out. Lagarde explained (via CNBC) that: “While the latest news on a vaccine looks encouraging, we could still face recurring cycles of accelerating viral spread and tightening restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved. “So the recovery may not be linear, but rather unsteady, stop-start and contingent on the pace of vaccine rollout,” Britain has passed another dark milestone in the pandemic tonight, with the UK’s headline Covid death toll passing 50,000. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has the details: The UK has recorded 595 further coronavirus deaths, taking the official headline death toll above 50,000 for the first time. This is the highest daily total since early May, and substantially above yesterday’s total - 532 - which was the previous highest total for this wave of the pandemic. The headline death total is now 50,365, making the UK the first country in Europe to pass this milestone. But this figure only counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. Taking into account all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, the UK total has passed 65,000. There have been 2,623 deaths in the past week, up 27% on the previous week. The UK has recorded 22,950 further positive cases. Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars, a prominent corporate backer of Brexit, has warned of sugar and syrup shortages in Northern Ireland in the new year, due to lack of clarity over the UK and EU trade relationship. The company is the largest cane sugar brand in the UK and supplies the main supermarkets in Northern Ireland. It has advised retailers to draw up contingency plans to source sugar and syrup from elsewhere, because it will struggle to get its products to them next year, according to ITV News. Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars, which was sold by Tate &amp; Lyle plc to American Sugar Refining in 2010, said the uncertainty over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol was likely to cause significant outages in Northern Ireland. The company owns the Thames Refinery in London, the biggest sugar refinery in Europe. Drinks giant Diageo has suffered a bitter blow today --recalling all its new non-alcoholic Guinness stout because of “microbiological contamination”. It warned that cans of the new Guinness 0.0 drink, which took four years to develop and launched two weeks ago, may be “unsafe to consume”. If you’re got some, return it to your retailer for a refund. The contamination is understood to have occurred during the production process at its St James’s Gate brewery in Dublin, so production and canning are on hold while tests are carried out. With the lockdown hitting pub sales this year, this is unfortunate timing for Diageo. Sarah Riding, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says: “Supply chain forethought and contingencies are key to making any product launch seamless and successful, and sometimes, it is only instances such as this that trigger a through and rigorous audit of the individual checks in place to ensure prevention at all times. “The cost of recalling, as well as any lost brand equity can be extremely disabling at the best of times, but the pressures of the pandemic may make this even harder to bear – better guaranteeing this won’t happen in future will save far more in the long run, of course.” Britain’s FTSE 100 is firmly on track for its eighth day of gains in a row, now up 85 points 0r 1.35% at 6383 in late trading. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says London’s market is leading the way today: Less electric than the last few sessions, the markets nevertheless continued to ride the wave of Pfizer vaccine positivity. The FTSE was head and shoulders above its peers this Wednesday. Climbing more than 1.3%, the UK index crossed 6,380 for the first time in 5-months. That means it is getting close to the 6,500 peak it hit before unravelling across the summer Remaining near the top of the FTSE 100 charts was British Airways-owner IAG, which surged another 6%, meaning it has moved from £1.05 to 1.48 in the space of 3 sessions. Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading - while tech stocks are making a comeback. The Dow has dropped by 52 points, or 0.2%, to 29,368. The Nasdaq, though, has surged by 189 points or 1.6% to 11,743. As in London, some of the big gainers from earlier this week are dipping back. Financial services firm American Express’s shares are down 4%, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar has dropped 2.5%. Big Tech is back in vogue, with Salesforce.com gaining 3.5% and Microsoft up 2.6%. Clearly investors are trying to assess exactly how quickly, and widely, Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out, and what impact that will have on the global economy. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, says the growth vs value discussion is back. Remember that in a COVID-19 world, digital businesses rule. They clean up in terms of advertising revenue and sales. Traditional businesses suffer. They have rent, they pump oil, they borrow short and lend long in a world of zero interest rates. And growth stocks crush value stocks, at least in terms of performance. But in a post-COVID world, where growth begins to recover, alternatives begin to emerge. Digital businesses look expensive. Their multiples are high, their prospects perhaps over-hyped (at times). And then everyone starts thinking about things like mean reversion and hoary old sayings like ‘trees don’t grow to the sky’ (like they said about Amazon in 2014/15/16/17 etc). It probably explains why Zoom fell 17% on Monday. Goldman Sachs has also predicted the US stock market will climb higher over the next couple of years. It now estimates the S&amp;P 500 index will end this year at 3,700 points - around 4% higher than currently, up from 3,600 points previously. And Goldman then sees stocks rising sharply higher next year, and in 2022, We forecast S&amp;P 500 will climb by 16% to 4300 at year-end 2021 and gain 7% to reach 4600 by the end of 2022. The market is actually less dependent on the performance of a few mega-cap stocks than many investors perceive. This forecast is based on the assumption that at least one vaccine is approved by the FDA and administered to a large portion of the US population. It also assumes that the Republican Party maintains control of the US Senate following run-off elections in Georgia, making it harder for president-elect Biden to push major tax reforms through. Goldman Sachs’ equity strategist David Kostin explained: A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The much-awaited results from Pfizer that its COVID-19 vaccine has an efficacy rate greater than 90% is a positive event that will allow society to gradually normalize during 2021. Elections have consequences, both for policies and markets. Joe Biden has been elected the 46th President of the United States. However, the upcoming 117th Congress (2021-2023) will likely remain divided but will depend on the results of two run-off Senate elections in Georgia on January 5th. Politics is policy and uncertainty will remain elevated until then. A divided government means little scope for major legislative changes, although trade and regulatory policy stances will likely differ relative to the Trump administration. Unified control would mean more fiscal spending but also higher individual and corporate tax rates. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that stocks in London will continue to recover ground over the next year or so, thanks to the encouraging Pfizer vaccine news. In a research note to clients today, they predict that the FTSE 100 will reach 7200 points by the end of next year. That’s around 13% higher than today’s levels. GS believes that economic growth across Europe will pick up strongly in 2021. It will be helped (they predict) by a vaccine rollout, increased fiscal support (government spending) and strong monetary support. Goldman’s equity strategist Sharon Bell writes: Our economists expect growth to show a marked acceleration from the end of 1Q as lockdowns ease and populations start to be vaccinated; European and global growth next year should be close to 6%. The recent positive news on vaccine efficacy from Pfizer supports their view. And on the London market specifically, they believe it will benefit from a rotation into ‘value’ stocks (where the FTSE is relatively overweight), away from ‘growth’ stocks such as tech firms. FTSE 100 has underperformed European equities by about 15% YTD, dragged down by its exposure to commodity prices and the underperformance of Value for most of the year. However, we see the improved macro and commodities environment as supportive going forward, and forecast FTSE 100 to reach 7200 by the end of 2021. Vaccine optimism is continuing to push European stock markets higher. The FTSE 100 index is now up 62 points, or 1%, at 6358 -- the highest since June. The Footsie has now gained over 7% this week, putting it on track for the best weekly performance since April. Airline group IAG is currently the top risers on the FTSE 100, up 7%. Other risers include DIY chain Kingfisher (+5.8%) and Ocado (+4.8%). Their shares had fallen earlier this week as investors piled into beaten-up airlines, hospitality companies, and banks, but are now back in favour. Other European markets are showing gains, keeping the Stoxx 600 index at an eight-month high. Germany’s DAX: up 58 points or 0.45% at 13,221 France’s CAC: up 28 points or 0.6% at 5448 Italy’s FTSE MIB: up 181 points or 0.8% at 21,033 Spanish IBEX: up 73 points, or 0.95%, at 7,784 Pfizer’s vaccine will be logistically complicated to roll out, not least because it needs to be kept extremely cold. But Joshua Mahony, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says the encouraging Pfizer/BioNTech results are boosting hopes for other vaccines too “With the UK expected to begin administering the Pfizer vaccine in just a months’ time, there is a feeling that this could move particularly quickly once a vaccine has been approved. “Russian claims of a similarly effective vaccine does highlight the fact that the world will need multiple solutions to allow a swifter resolution to this crisis, with the UK crossing their fingers that the AstraZeneca product could provide a less logistically complex solution. Over in America, the number of weekly mortgage applications has fallen back. Mortgage applications decreased 0.5% week-on-week in the seven days to Friday 6th, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. In the previous week, mortgage applications jumped by 3.8%, so this is quite a reversal [although these weekly figures can be erratic, and potential housebuyers may have been distracted by the election]. It could remind US politicians of the need for a new stimulus package, with economists concerned that its economy is slowing. Back in Europe, the pound has briefly nudged a six-month high against the euro. Sterling traded as high as €1.1284, the highest since May, before dropping back towards its earlier two-month high. Reuters reports that vaccine optimism is giving the pound a lift: The pound benefited as investors judged that a vaccine would be a particular boon to the UK, which has seen its economy ravaged by the coronavirus. “Since Britain has been disproportionately hit by the virus, it will be disproportionately helped by a vaccine,” wrote Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group. The euro has also lost ground against the US dollar today, down nearly half a cent. Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at Société Générale, points out: In FX, this week’s wining currencies come from countries which might have been thinking about negative rates but haven’t yet done the deed, and the losers are the ones which already have negative rates. The yen, Swiss franc and euro are all lower against the dollar since the vaccine news emerged. But, of course, the Brexit negotiations will also influence both currencies. Daniel Boffey, our Brussels bureau chief, reports that a video conference summit of EU leaders on 19 November is now viewed by Brussels as the final deadline for a draft Brexit deal, with negotiations continuing... The thorniest problems to resolve remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, how to maintain fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. China’s technology giants ended the day deep in the red, following Beijing’s proposed clampdown on anticompetitive conduct. Alibaba led the fallers, along with fellow e-commerce giant JD.com, tech conglomerate Tencent, and shopping platform and food delivery service Meituan. Electronics manufacturer Xiaomi also dropped sharply, as tech stocks fell further out of favour. Alibaba: -9.80% Tencent Holdings: -7.4% JD.com: -9.2% Meituan: -9.6% Xiaomi: -8.2% As explained earlier, the new rules would rein in a range of behaviour, by: attempting to stop companies sharing sensitive consumer data, forming alliances to hurt smaller rivals, or subsidising services below cost price to eliminate competitors. clamping down on platforms forcing businesses into exclusivity arrangements preventing companies treating customers differently based on their data and spending habits. Bloomberg has more details: The Hang Seng Tech Index slumped more than 6% on Wednesday in Hong Kong, taking its two-day loss to 11%. Shares in the quintet of firms have sunk at least 11% over two sessions. Bloomberg: Alibaba Leads Chinese Internet Selloff Nearing $290 Billion Concerns about China has also helped prompt the British government to draw up new proposed powers to block takeovers and corporate deals that threaten national security. The National Security and Investment Bill, published this morning, will give ministers greater powers to scrutinise takeover activity in key sectors such as energy and defence. Business Secretary Alok Sharma has said the proposed legislation will stop ‘hostile actors’ from threatening the public’s safety. “The UK remains one of the most attractive investment destinations in the world and we want to keep it that way. “But hostile actors should be in no doubt - there is no back door into the UK.”. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, explains: Ministers and officials have been careful to draw up the legislation in a country-neutral manner, but although there are concerns about Russian companies, it is takeovers involving Chinese firms that will come under the greatest scrutiny. The proposals emerge at a time of heightened political concern about Chinese ownership in key parts of the economy, while the coronavirus pandemic has also further revealed dependencies on foreign suppliers for critical goods. A growing number of Conservative backbenchers also want to make it harder for Chinese companies to buy strategic British firms – after they successfully forced the government to drop Huawei from 5G mobile networks after 2027. One of the party’s MPs, Bob Seely, said he welcomed the intent of the bill but wanted ministers to be clear about how far takeovers by foreign companies could be blocked amid concerns over human rights. More here: European stock markets have also extended their gains this morning, with France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX both up around 0.4%. This has pushed the Stoxx 600 index to a fresh eight-month high, clawing back more of its losses since the pandemic began. Geoff Yu, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon, says: This week’s momentous news of a potentially successful vaccine for COVID-19 has triggered one of the biggest rotations in asset markets in recent memory. Unsurprisingly, the eurozone equities market has been a major beneficiary as its value heavy components finally found favor. Yu adds that the eurozone should benefit from more fiscal support next year, while US politicians have so far failed to agree a new Covid-19 stimulus package. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw the vaccine news as an opening to reduce the amount of stimulus which could be deployed, the eurozone has just overcome certain political hurdles to agree the Next Generation EU rescue fund and a multi-year budget to start deployment as soon as mid-next year. The oil price is higher again this morning too, with Brent crude gaining 3% to $45 per barrel. That’s its highest level since 2nd September, up from below $38 at the end of October. Overnight, the American Petroleum Institute reported a larger drop in reserves than expected, suggesting a pick-up in demand for oil and gasoline. Ongoing vaccine optimism is also lifting oil, as Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM explains: Crude oil continues its relentless rally, the exodus from tech stocks is in full swing, and sovereign bond yields are marching higher, keeping the broader stock market on a tight leash. Speaking of Rolls-Royce... it is also pledging to create 6,000 UK jobs within five years if the government backs its plans to build small nuclear reactors around the country. The idea is to create most of the components at factories across the Midlands and the north of England, so they can be moved to existing nuclear sites around the country to be assembled. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The engineering company is part of a consortium that is pushing for the government to commit billions of pounds to build 16 of the small modular reactors (SMRs) around the UK. The factory-built nuclear power stations are predicted to provide up to 440MW of electricity, enough to power a city of 450,000 homes for 60 years... Small nuclear reactors were first developed in the 1950s to use in nuclear-powered submarines. Since then Rolls-Royce has designed reactors for seven classes of submarine and two separate land-based prototype reactors. Meanwhile in London, the stock market has continued its recent strong rally. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is currently up 32 points, or 0.5%, at 6328 points - back at levels last seen in June. But, some of the stocks which surged this week on Covid-19 vaccine optimism are dipping. Rolls-Royce is down over 4%, catering group Compass has lost 3.6%, and hotel chain InterContinental has dropped 3.1%. Ocado, which fell sharply earlier this week, is now up 3.6%, with DIY chain Kingfisher gaining 3.8% and pharmaceuticals group Hikma also in the risers (+2.8%). This suggests that the rotation out of companies who did well in the pandemic, and into those who will benefit most from a Covid-1 vaccine, is taking a breather. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Rotation is not going to be a straight line – this reopening move is taking a bit of a hit this morning. After the initial kneejerk, investors will need to work out now which ‘value’ stocks remain value traps and which have some growth in them. Expect pullbacks along the way but the overall landscape remains much more positive than it was a week ago for these sectors worst affected by the pandemic. China’s new antitrust regulations are a first major step towards curbing its tech giants, points out the The Financial Times: Until now, Chinese regulators have taken a relatively hands-off approach to antitrust, even as authorities in the US and Europe launched inquiries and investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Google and others. This is in spite of the fact that Chinese tech companies have been building increasingly captive ecosystems, with users being prevented from using WeChat Pay to purchase products in Alibaba’s Taobao online store, for instance, or easily sharing links to Taobao goods within WeChat. The new guidelines mark the first time the State Administration for Market Regulation has directly tackled anti-competitive behaviour in the internet sector. “It signals the end of an era — it will fundamentally change the competition landscape in China for internet companies,” said Scott Yu, an antitrust expert at Zhonglun Law Firm. Bloomberg has calculated that more than $200bn has been wiped off China’s tech giants in the last two days. They report that the antitrust clampdown triggered a wave of selling (just a day after vaccine optimism triggered a rotation out of tech stocks): Chinese technology giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd shed almost $260 billion of market value over two days of frantic selling, as investors scrambled to assess the fallout from Beijing’s broadest attempt to rein in its most powerful private-sector firms. Technology shares tumbled for a second day after Beijing issued regulations designed to curb the growing influence of internet-sector leaders including JD.com Inc., Meituan and Xiaomi Corp. The Hang Seng Tech Index slumped 5.6% on Wednesday in Hong Kong, taking its two-day loss to 10% as of midday. Shares in the quintet of firms have sunk at least 8% over two sessions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in China’s technology industry have taken a tumble after Beijing’s market regulator took its first major step towards tackling the monopolistic power of its tech giants. The State Administration for Market Regulation’s new draft rules will, for the first time, defines what constitutes anti-competitive behaviour -- covering pricing, payment methods, and the use of data to target shoppers. These proposed anti-monopoly rules are designed to ensure fair competition in the web space, and prevent internet platforms from dominating the market or using methods to blocking fair competition. The move seems certain to put e-commerce marketplaces and payment services under closer scrutiny... and investor have reacted by ditching tech shares sharply. E-commerce giant Alibaba’s shares, for example, have slumped by 9% today, while rival JD.com is down over 8%. The news came China’s web giants were gearing up for Singles Day, the annual online sale which is their biggest day of the year. Reuters explains: The draft rules would also consider whether a transaction treats different customers in different ways based on big data, payment ability, consumption preferences, and usage habits. The draft rules issued on Tuesday would look to prevent e-commerce practices such as “choose one between two”, under which an e-commerce marketplace restricts brands from selling on multiple platforms.

In evidence submitted to the influential public accounts committee (PAC), which is currently investigating the nuclear plant deal, scientists from Sussex University state that the costs of the Trident programme could be “unsupportable” without “an effective subsidy from electricity consumers to military nuclear infrastructure”. Prof Andy Stirling and Dr Phil Johnstone from the Science Policy Research Unit at the university write that the £19.6bn Hinkley Point project will “maintain a large-scale national base of nuclear-specific skills” without which there is concern “that the costs of UK nuclear submarine capabilities could be insupportable.” Their evidence suggests that changes in the government’s policy on nuclear power in recent years will effectively allow Britain’s military nuclear industry to be supported by payments from electricity consumers. Last June, MPs passed a motion in favour of replacing four submarines carrying Trident missiles at a cost of £40bn. “What our research suggests is that British low-carbon energy strategies are more expensive than they need to be, in order to maintain UK military nuclear infrastructures,” said Stirling. “And without assuming the continuation of an extremely expensive UK civil nuclear industry, it is likely that the costs of Trident would be significantly greater.” The Hinkley Point project has been criticised for its huge cost. The French electricity company EDF is currently in the early stages of constructing the plant near Bridgwater, Somerset, in partnership with the China General Nuclear Power Group. The government has agreed a minimum price of £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) for electricity produced by Hinkley Point, the first new-build nuclear power plant in the UK since 1995. Under this agreement, if the usual wholesale price is lower, the consumer pays the difference in price. The current wholesale electricity price is around £42 per MWh, so the electricity consumer would pay EDF an extra £50 per MWh. Last month, the government agreed a “strike price” of £57.50 per MWh for offshore windfarms off Scotland and Yorkshire, far below the Hinkley guaranteed price. This week, the Green MP Caroline Lucas asked the government about the Ministry of Defence and the business department discussing the “relevance of UK civil nuclear industry skills and supply chains to the maintaining of UK nuclear submarine and wider nuclear weapons capabilities”. Harriett Baldwin, the defence procurement minister, answered that “it is fully understood that civil and defence sectors must work together to make sure resource is prioritised appropriately for the protection and prosperity of the United Kingdom”. Johnstone said the decision-making process behind Hinkley raised questions about transparency and accountability, saying: “In this ever more networked world, both civil and military nuclear technologies are increasingly recognised as obsolete. Yet it seems UK policymaking is quietly trying to further entrench the two – in ways that have been escaping democratic accountability.” At a hearing held by the PAC in parliament on Monday, senior civil servants defended the Hinkley deal after a National Audit Office report concluded that it was “risky and expensive”. The officials admitted that the economic case had become “more marginal” in recent years, as the costs of alternative technologies had fallen. When she became prime minister last year, Theresa May asked for a review of the project. When asked why the strike price had not been renegotiated at that point, Stephen Lovegrove, the former permanent secretary at the now-disbanded Department of Energy and Climate Change, told MPs that the deal would have fallen through if the government tried to reduce payments to EDF. “Candidly, the idea the deal would not have collapsed if we had sought to renegotiate it is fanciful, actually.” May allowed Hinkley Point to proceed after the three-month review. The civil servants said the costs were higher because the companies agreed to carry the risk for the project, as required by ministers. “This deal is a very good one within the policy constraints of the time,” said Lovegrove. At the PAC hearing, the Labour MP Meg Hillier asked whether “Hinkley is a great opportunity to maintain our nuclear skills base”. Lovegrove answered: “We are completing the build of the nuclear submarines which carry conventional weaponry. So somehow there is very definitely an opportunity here for the nation to grasp in terms of building up its nuclear skills. I don’t think that’s going to happen by accident. It is going to require concerted government action to make that happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/22/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-consumers-mps-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C subsidy has dealt consumers 'a bad hand', say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-consumers-mps-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-consumers-mps-contract","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C subsidy has dealt consumers 'a bad hand', say MPs","bodyText":"MPs have accused the government of failing to protect consumers over the price it has promised to pay for power from the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The Commons public accounts committee said the subsidy contract for Hinkley Point C, agreed in 2016 after years of delays, would hit poorest households hardest. The power station is expected to cost billpayers £30bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding £10-£15 to the average household energy bill. But an assessment by the committee concluded that no one in Whitehall was championing consumers’ interests during negotiations with French company EDF Energy. The final bill for consumers was exacerbated by government not renegotiating the guaranteed power price for fear that EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would walk away from the project, which the MPs said was a questionable assumption. Officials agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 but fossil fuel price projections fell between then and the contract being signed in 2016, pushing the cost to consumers up fivefold from £6bn to £30bn. At the time the Department of Energy and Climate Change – now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – did not consider a ceiling on the guaranteed price, the MPs were told. Meg Hillier, chair of the group of MPs, said: “Billpayers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project.” The criticism from the committee follows a damning report by the UK’s spending watchdog, the NAO, which found the contract for Hinkley had locked consumers into a “risky and expensive project”. The NAO attacked the government for failing to explore alternative financing models, such as taking stake in the project, a criticism that the MPs echoed. The public accounts committee said it was also disappointed that the government appeared to have no plan in place to maximise the wider benefits of the project, beyond the clean power it will provide. “The department does not know to what extent UK workers and companies will benefit from Hinkley Point C and the wider follow-on new nuclear programme, and has no plan in place to show how it will maximise the wider benefits of the project,” the report said. A BEIS spokeswoman said: “The government negotiated a competitive deal for the construction of the first new nuclear power station in a generation as part of our energy mix, which ensures consumers won’t pay a penny for any construction overruns and until the station generates electricity in 2025.” The MPs urged the government to publish a plan B for keeping the lights on, in the event the power station does not come online in 2025 as planned. EDF has already warned that the plant could be completed 15 months late. French, Japanese and Chinese developers hope to secure financial incentives from the UK to build other new nuclear power plants, but the MPs said the government should re-evaluate the strategic case before going ahead with more projects. “The government made some grave strategic errors here and must now explain what it will do to ensure these are not repeated,” said Hillier of the Hinkley contract. EDF defended the deal and said Hinkley would help cut costs for other future nuclear power stations, such as the one it hopes to build at Sizewell in Suffolk. A spokesman said: “The agreed price is lower than 80% of other low carbon capacity contracted so far and the project has restarted UK nuclear construction after a quarter century. Construction is fully under way and is already delivering a huge benefit to British jobs, skills and industrial strategy.” •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/mar/10/fukushima-eight-years-on-evacuees-come-home","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-10T13:45:43Z","webTitle":"Eight years after Fukushima, what has made evacuees come home?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/fukushima-eight-years-on-evacuees-come-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/mar/10/fukushima-eight-years-on-evacuees-come-home","fields":{"headline":"Eight years after Fukushima, what has made evacuees come home?","bodyText":"On 11 March 2011, one of the biggest earthquakes ever recorded struck Japan’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people. In Fukushima, the waves’ destructive power unleashed another menace – a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Radiation forced tens of thousands to evacuate, turning towns and villages into no-go zones. Today, neighbourhoods closest to the plant are trapped in time. Homes have fallen into disrepair and weeds and other plants have been left to swallow up pavements, roads and once well-tended gardens, while boar and other wild animals roam the streets. But a little further out, there are signs of recovery: new shops, restaurants and public buildings catering to the small number of people who have decided to return. Rail services are being restored and roads have reopened. The Japan leg of the torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will start at J Village, once the base for the response to the crisis, now restored to its previous role as a football training complex. But these are modest gains. In areas that have been declared safe for human habitation, many residents have decided to stay away, citing radiation fears, especially for their children, and a lack of medical facilities and other social infrastructure. Only 23% of those living in areas that were declared off-limits after the disaster have returned, according to government figures. Workers at Fukushima Daiichi are battling with huge quantities of radioactive water, while decommissioning the plant is expected to take at least four decades. Eight years after the world’s second-biggest nuclear disaster (after Chernobyl), the Observer met residents who have decided to resume their lives in areas that were once declared a nuclear no-go zone – to work, study and spend their twilight years in the place they call home. The landowner Seimei Sasaki became a local celebrity during the eight years he spent living in temporary housing for evacuees. He was part of a group of residents who built a sense of community through daily early-morning exercise routines. At 93, he is a dedicated driver who can be spotted on the roads in the Odaka district, where his family put down roots almost 500 years ago. The landowner-forester has just moved back into his grand old wooden house. His three sons and their families are near by, but Sasaki insists on fending for himself – a determination he attributes to his samurai ancestors – even if it means spending long periods alone. The neighbourhood was home to 230 people, but only 23 – with an average age of over 70 – have returned, he says, before reeling off their family names. “I can’t imagine what this village’s future looks like. I fear that it’s slowly dying.” Sasaki, though, is trying to stay optimistic. “I’m in perfect health and I can use daycare facilities for free because I’m an evacuee, and I keep in touch with my friends from temporary housing.” Then there is the small matter of his beloved car. “My licence expires in December and I don’t know what to do,” he says, conceding that, at his age, it may be time to surrender it. Outside sits a second-hand mobility scooter given to him by a friend. Sasaki hops on, but he is not impressed. “It is so slow … and it doesn’t look very cool.” The sisters At Rumiko and Eriko Konno’s school, getting the teacher’s attention is rarely a problem. The sisters are two of only seven pupils attending Namie Sosei primary and middle school two and a half miles from the nuclear power plant. The new school, complete with an all-weather football pitch, was built with government money in an attempt to bring young families back to Namie, where only 900 of the pre-disaster population of 21,000 have returned since the evacuation order was partially lifted in 2017. “I was conflicted about bringing them back,” says their mother, Mayumi. “But now, a year on, they have settled in, I have found work and I’m sure we did the right thing.” The school will welcome six more pupils when the new academic year starts in April. “Over the past year the children have made great progress,” says the principal, Ryuichi Baba. “The most frustrating thing for them is that they can’t play team sports.” Rumiko, 11, and Eriko, eight, say they miss playing dodgeball and hide-and-seek. “I would like more classmates, but that would bring a different kind of pressure,” says Rumiko. They have studied the tsunami and nuclear accident in class, but find it hard to relate to something they are too young to remember. “It was eight years ago, so I don’t really think about it,” says Rumiko. “I’m more worried about the people who are having to cope with natural disasters today.” The rice farmer When Koichi Nemoto first returned to his fields in the Fukushima village of Momouchi three years ago, his dream was to grow enough rice to feed his family. But a ban on rice production forced him to wait. “I grew sample batches and tested them – they were well below the government-set radiation limits,” says Nemoto, “But I had to throw it away, because it was against the law to eat my own rice.” Today the restrictions have been lifted and the 81-year-old, a pioneer in Fukushima’s organic farming industry, is growing rice commercially again, supplying the grain to a nearby sake brewery, supermarkets and restaurants. “I never thought of abandoning my farm,” he says. “There were harmful rumours about Fukushima rice at first, but attitudes are changing. My friends and relatives are more comfortable about eating rice from here than from other prefectures where it isn’t tested.” It is a far cry from the years he spent as an evacuee, wondering if he would ever grow rice again. Yet, as the only one of eight farmers in Momouchi who decided to revive their business after the evacuation order was lifted, he is an exception. These days, though, he says he worries less about radiation than the weeds that run riot in his paddies. “You have to expect that when you farm organically,” he says. “But my rice always wins in the end.” The inn owners When Tomoko and Takenori Kobayashi heard the explosion in one of the reactor buildings, they gathered their valuables and left Futaba-ya, a traditional ryokan inn in the Odaka district that has been in Tomoko’s family for four generations. They were convinced they would be able to return after a few days. “We were in the evacuation centre when we first saw images of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster, and it was only then we realised just how awful it was,” says Tomoko. The couple didn’t return until June 2016 after the evacuation order was lifted in Odaka. While their neighbourhood was still off limits, Tomoko made repeated short visits to maintain the inn and plant flowers outside the nearby railway station. “We were determined to get back on our feet,” she says. The couple quickly became experts in radiation and food safety. “We’ve been testing food for the local community for seven years, and we know it’s safe,” says Takenori. “That gave us the confidence to come back and start again.” Futaba-ya’s guests include an increasing number of overseas visitors, curious to learn more about Fukushima. “We want people to stay here and go back feeling they know more about the truth of what happened,” says Tomoko. “But we can’t pretend it’s been easy – there have been some extremely tough times.” The dairy farmer Eight years ago Tetsuji Sakuma was powerless to prevent the destruction of the dairy farm his grandfather had built just after the second world war. In the days after the nuclear meltdown, some of his 130 cows died while others were sold to a ranch or slaughtered. Thousands of litres of milk had to be thrown away. But now, Sakuma is back in business after the ban on shipping raw milk from Fukushima was lifted in late 2017. Rigorous testing shows the milk from his cows is safe, but overcoming doubts among potential buyers was a challenge at first. “I studied radiation and was prepared for any questions that might come up over safety,” says Sakuma, who took over the farm in Katsurao village from his father more than 20 years ago. Many other local farmers have decided to sell up, fearing that they are too old to revive their businesses, and that their produce will be forever tainted by its association with Fukushima. Just 20% of the village’s pre-disaster population – or about 300 people – have returned. “The longer people spend living elsewhere, the harder it is for them to come back,” Sakuma says. “But we worked hard over the years to make this farm a success. We built the cowsheds ourselves and they are still standing today. As the son of a farming family, I was determined to reopen the farm and show people that, even here, anything is possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/oct/12/weatherwatch-the-uks-climate-is-ideal-for-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-12T20:30:13Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: the UK's climate is ideal for renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/12/weatherwatch-the-uks-climate-is-ideal-for-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/oct/12/weatherwatch-the-uks-climate-is-ideal-for-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: the UK's climate is ideal for renewable energy","bodyText":"A maritime climate with wind, sun and waves and an island surrounded by shallow seas with a high tidal range makes the UK probably the best-placed country in the world to take advantage of renewable energy. Britain is already a world leader in offshore wind but has been reluctant to invest in other promising technologies. Underwater sea turbines in particular, wave power and various forms of tidal barrage have failed to be given the political support needed to get them into the mainstream. In some cases the government is actively discouraging renewables – the onshore wind industry and now solar power. Instead, taxpayer’s money and executive powers are being used to back nuclear power and fracking for gas. With scientists warning that we only have a 12-year window to save the planet from exceeding a dangerous 1.5C increase in temperature neither of these technologies is going to help avoid that threat. There is still time to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions because the renewables that most suit our climate have already been developed and can be installed rapidly. These, plus new battery technology and multiple novel ways of balancing supply and demand including biogas and hydrogen production, make this energy revolution possible.

President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran will stop exporting enriched uranium stocks as stipulated by the 2015 agreement and warned it would resume higher uranium enrichment in 60 days if the remaining signatories did not make good on promises to shield its oil and banking sectors from sanctions. Wednesday’s measures, announced by Rouhani in an address to the nation, were formally conveyed to ambassadors to countries remaining inside the deal – France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, separately set out the technical and legal details in a letter to the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini. Under the deal, Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it, thereby allowing it to generate nuclear power without building nuclear weapons. Rouhani said Iran wanted to negotiate new terms with the remaining partners in the deal, but warned that the situation was dire. “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective … This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.” The move is bound to be seized upon by Washington as proof that the nuclear deal – which the US violated in May 2018 – has collapsed and is no longer worth pursuing. EU officials were informed privately of the extent of Iran’s response at a meeting on Tuesday. On Tuesday night, a French source warned that Europe would have no choice but to impose economic sanctions against Iran if it stepped back from the deal. “We don’t want that and we hope that the Iranians will not make this decision,” the source said. Rouhani has been under intense domestic political pressure to produce some kind of counter-measure following the US withdrawal. Tehran has lost patience with Europe’s efforts to create a new viable financial mechanism that would allow European firms to continue trading items such as medicines and humanitarian goods with Iran and circumvent US secondary sanctions. Zarif separately issued his own warning from Moscow, where has been meeting his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. “After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that [the] US has made impossible to continue,” he tweeted. World powers have “a narrowing window to reverse this”. The Trump administration has repeatedly warned European multinationals they will face swingeing US Treasury fines if they trade with Iran and try to operate in the US market. Almost all large European firms have withdrawn from the Iranian market, depressing the economy still further. Under its policy of “maximum pressure”, Washington has extended sweeping sanctions on Tehran and in recent weeks has hit even harder, moving to ban all countries from buying Iran’s oil, its top export, and declaring the Revolutionary Guards to be a terrorist group – the first such designation of a unit of a foreign government. UN inspectors say Iran has remained in compliance with the nuclear deal, which is still backed by European powers as well as Democrats seeking to unseat Trump next year. Iran will claim its announcement falls within sections 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, the deal signed in 2015, which allows Iran to take steps if one party withdraws from the agreement. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is bound to seize on Tehran’s move as a lever with which to prise Europe away from its support for the deal, which was seen as a high-water mark of European diplomacy. Pompeo has been in Iraq this week on an unscheduled visit, where he has been warning about unspecified Iranian activity. European diplomats are left to manage an often contradictory Washington foreign policy, but broadly fear that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, is pursuing a strategy of regime change in Iran that will only backfire, ushering in a more hardline stance. The Kremlin said Iran had been provoked into rolling back some of the terms of the deal due to external pressure, which it blamed on the US. “President [Putin] has repeatedly spoken of the consequences of unthought-out steps regarding Iran and by that I mean the decision taken by Washington [to quit the deal]. Now we are seeing those consequences are starting to happen,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated his country’s long-held position of not allowing Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. “This morning, on my way here, I heard that Iran intends to pursue its nuclear programme,” he said in a speech marking Israel’s Memorial Day. “We will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weaponry. We will continue to fight those who would kill us.” In Britain, interim Middle East minister Mark Field said the Iranian announcement was unwelcome, but added “we are not at this stage talking of reimposing sanctions”. That would change if Iran clearly abandoned its obligations under the deal, he said, adding that an official would travel to Tehran this week to continue dialogue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/sep/15/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-sajid-javid-tory-masks-vaccines","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-15T22:51:00Z","webTitle":"Truss replaces Raab in reshuffle as Zahawi gets education role following Williamson’s exit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/sep/15/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-sajid-javid-tory-masks-vaccines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/sep/15/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-sajid-javid-tory-masks-vaccines","fields":{"headline":"Truss replaces Raab in reshuffle as Zahawi gets education role following Williamson’s exit – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s been a dramatic day in Westminster with Boris Johnson laying the groundwork for the next general election with a ruthless cabinet reshuffle, designed to clear out failing ministers and hand Michael Gove the key job of making “levelling up” a reality for sceptical voters. The Guardian’s political editor Heather Stewart reports. Johnson sacked three cabinet ministers - the blunderous, and at times disastrous, education secretary Gavin Williamson, the justice secretary Robert Buckland, and the housing secretary Robert Jenrick. Rather than being offered an alternative role, Williamson was relegated straight back to the backbenches. Liz Truss, popular with the Tory grassroots, was promoted to foreign secretary - the first female Conservative to hold the role - while Dominic Raab was shifted to the justice brief, widely seen as punishment for his role in the chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan last month, and wrestled the title of deputy PM. Michael Gove was promoted to secretary of state for housing, communities and local government with responsibility for enacting Johnson’s “levelling-up” agenda across government. He will also be responsible for diffusing the row over planning reforms in Tory heartlands, protecting the union and fighting elections. The chancellor Rishi Sunak, the home secretary Priti Patel, the leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, all remain in post. Also staying are Ben Wallace in defence, Saijd Javid in health, Kwasi Kwarteng in business, George Eustice at Defra, Grant Shapps in transport, Thérèse Coffey at DWP, Brandon Lewis in Northern Ireland, Alister Jack in Scotland, and Simon Hart in Wales. Natalie Evans remains leader of the Lords. Nadine Dorries was a surprise appointment to the role of culture secretary, given her often robust “anti-woke” agenda and her affinity to the culture wars. Nadhim Zahawi, considered a safe pair of hands, moved to the role of education secretary. Lord Frost remains as the Cabinet Office minister responsible for Brexit, and Kit Malthouse stays on as policing minister though now attends Cabinet. Greg Hands is now business minister, while Kemi Badenoch remains minister for equalities but also housing minister and foreign minister. Oliver Dowden became party co-chair, replacing Amanda Milling. Steve Barclay moves to role of Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, while Simon Clarke is now chief secretary of the Treasury. Alok Sharma remains as COP26 president. And here is Heather’s full explainer on who’s up and who’s down: Here is a roundup of how some of tomorrow’s front pages are presenting the reshuffle: The Sun: “Queen Liz in... Raab is out” The Daily Express: “PM’s ruthless cull to deliver Britain’s future” The Daily Mail: “At last, Boris wields the axe” The Times: “Johnson wields axe in cabinet reshuffle” The Daily Telegraph: “Raab and Gove lose out as Truss promoted” The Daily Star: “Clowning Street massacre” The Daily Mirror: “Boris has a Cabinet clear-out” The Financial Times: “Johnson sweeps out his cabinet to revive faith in reform agenda” And The Guardian: “PM’s ruthless reshuffle lays ground for next election” Boris Johnson has laid the groundwork for the next general election with a ruthless cabinet reshuffle designed to clear out failing ministers and hand Michael Gove the key job of making “levelling up” a reality for sceptical voters. On a day of dramatic developments in Westminster, Johnson sacked three cabinet ministers including the gaffe-prone education secretary Gavin Williamson, and shifted Dominic Raab from the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Justice. Liz Truss, the media-savvy darling of Conservative grassroots members and champion of free markets, will replace Raab as foreign secretary. The full story is here: The PM has just tweeted this, concluding today’s cabinet reshuffle. The new education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, says he’s honoured to be working at the Department for Education in his new role: Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I’ll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer. From my own experience, I know what a beacon of opportunity this country can be and I want all children, young people and adults to have access to a brilliant education, the right qualifications and opportunities to secure good jobs. That’s both vital for them and also our economy and is more important now than ever before. I can’t wait to get started, working with the amazing teachers and staff in our nurseries, schools, colleges and universities as well as employers and businesses. And Jacob Rees-Mogg is staying as Lord President of the Council and as Commons Leader. Suella Braverman remains as attorney general. Michelle Donelan remains education minister and will also attend Cabinet, No 10 says. Simon Clarke has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, No 10 says. He will also attend cabinet. Nigel Adams has been appointed minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, No 10 says. He was previously a Foreign Office minister. Kit Malthouse remains a minister in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, Downing Street said. The ally of Boris Johnson will attend cabinet, No 10 added. With the cabinet reshuffle having somewhat overshadowed the Commons vote urging the government to cancel the cut to the £20 universal credit uplift, Labour has highlighted that sacked Tory ministers - who voted for the cut - will be handed £17,000 each in severance payments when they return to the backbenches. Ministers and other paid office holders who receive a ministerial salary are entitled to a severance payment when they leave office, which generally equals three months of their annual ministerial salary. Labour’s motion to stop the planned £1,000 a year cut to universal credit passed as the government ordered its MPs to abstain. The cut will affect one in 14 British workers and see an estimated 700,000 people plunged into poverty, including 200,000 children. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: That the government is giving payoffs to those they do not deem competent enough to be in government while cutting the incomes of millions of people is an insult to hard-working people. It is deeply regrettable that the Conservatives have chosen not to protect struggling families from the prime minister’s £1,000-a-year cut. Labour is on the side of working families and will keep pushing for the government to see sense, listen to the house and cancel this cut. Baroness Evans of Bowes Park is staying as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Lords, No 10 says. And George Eustice is staying as environment secretary, No 10 says. There was some doubt as to whether he would stay because it was reported earlier this year that Carrie Symonds, a conservationist and animal lover, wanted him replaced because she thinks he is not doing enough on animal welfare. That’s all from me for tonight. My colleague Lucy Campbell is taking over now. Almost all the cabinet jobs have now been confirmed or announced, although we do not know what is happening to Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, and who will replace Stephen Barclay as chief secretary to the Treasury. There has been some talk of it being Rees-Mogg, which would mean someone joining the cabinet as leader of the house. No 10 has confirmed that Lord Frost is staying as Brexit minister and Alister Jack is staying as Scottish secretary. Simon Hart is staying as Welsh secretary, No 10 says. Ed Vaizey, the former culture minister, has welcomed the appointment of Nadine Dorries as the new culture secretary. Given that he is reportedly angling for the Ofcom chairmanship, he may be keen to make a good impression. And Brandon Lewis stays as Northern Ireland secretary, No 10 has announced. Grant Shapps has been reappointed transport secretary, he says. Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, says Anne-Marie Trevelyan, her new government opposite number, used to be a climate change denier. No 10 has confirmed that Alok Sharma, Cop26 president, Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary, Thérèse Coffey, work and pensions secretary, and Sajid Javid, health secretary, are all remaining in post. Robert Buckland has published his resignation letter on Twitter. If he is bitter about his sacking, he does not really show it and the letter is mostly a summary of what he has done that he is proud of. But he does say that the legal system needs more investment and that “years of underfunding beforehand have not helped”. He also says that, as a backbencher, he intends to campaign on behalf of the neurodiverse. He has an autistic daughter and he says: Support for those who are neurodiverse has always been a cause close to my heart and I have long advocated the need for the criminal justice [system] to better address those who are neurodiverse. This is a cause to pursue with vigour from the backbenches, as I indicated to you in our meeting. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has been appointed international trade secretary, No 10 has announced. She used to sit in cabinet as international development secretary until Boris Johnson merged the department with the Foreign Office last year. When her job disappeared she became a business minister, at minister of state level, and so this is a clear promotion. Conservative MPs warned Boris Johnson against “hastily” reducing universal credit (UC) for millions of families, as the House of Commons backed a motion to cancel the cut, PA Media reports. PA says: Former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb insisted the Conservatives should be “standing on the side” of supermarket workers, cleaners and carers and said it was unclear why the Government wanted to remove the £20 per week uplift to UC. He told MPs the “sudden, abrupt withdrawal” of the £20 uplift “is not the right way of doing welfare policy”. Conservative MP John Stevenson argued retaining the benefit boost would “improve many people’s lives” and aid the Government’s levelling up agenda. Another Tory, Peter Aldous, advised that keeping UC at its pandemic rate will help “prevent many people from falling into poverty and despair”, adding: “It would also provide the platform from which families can plan for better futures and can then realise their aspirations. As a society, and as an economy, we will all be better for that.” Ministers have come under sustained pressure to reverse their decision to end the £20 uplift introduced to support families during the coronavirus pandemic. The extra payments will be phased out from the end of September, with the government arguing it would cost £6bn to retain them. Labour tabled a motion asking the government to cancel the planned cut, amid concerns it will reduce support for families by up to 1,040 per year. MPs supported it by 253 votes to zero, majority 253. But the motion is non-binding and does not force the government to act. Labour former minister Dame Angela Eagle, raising a point of order, said it was a “disgrace” the Government had abstained on the vote and claimed they “haven’t got the guts” to properly deal with such matters in the division lobbies. The Commons division list shows that four Conservative MPs voted for the Labour motion. They were: Peter Aldous, Neil Hudson, John Stevenson and William Wragg. Stephen Barclay is the new Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He is replacing Michael Gove, who is now housing secretary. Barclay was chief secretary to the Treasury. Here is reaction to Nadhim Zahawi’s appointment as education secretary from three education specialists. From Mark Leach, founder of Wonkhe, a higher education policy website From Sam Freedman, a former Department for Education official who is now an education writer and adviser to Ark Schools From Laura McInerney, co-founder of the Teacher Tapp app Ben Wallace is staying as defence secretary, No 10 says. Nadhim Zahawi has been promoted to education secretary. He was vaccine deployment minister until today, and he has previously served in DfE as minister for children and families when Theresa May was PM. The BBC’s director of news has defended the corporation’s impartiality and criticised the abuse directed at a former UK Huffpost editor and experienced broadcast journalist who has just been appointed to a senior editorial post. The corporation announced the appointment of Jess Brammar, who will run the corporation’s rolling news channels, despite the attempts of a board member with ties to Downing Street to block the move on political grounds. The journalist, who had also worked as acting editor of Newsnight, had also faced months of attacks in Conservative media outlets after she emerged as the leading candidate for the role. Her appointment as executive editor, BBC news channels, comes despite a highly-unusual intervention by Sir Robbie Gibb, a former director of communications to Theresa May who was appointed to the BBC Board by the government earlier this year. In a leaked text message obtained by the Financial Times, Gibb said in June the BBC “cannot make this appointment” if they want to retain the support of the government. In an email to BBC staff on Wednesday, Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, wrote that the appointment had been made “through fair and open competition” and added that she wanted to address some points. She went on: In view of recent public speculation about BBC News appointments. BBC News has to be impartial and independent. BBC journalists are hired from a variety of different backgrounds, but while working at the BBC, they leave any personal opinions at the door. Any individual should be judged on how they do their job at the BBC, not on what they have done in different organisations with very different objectives. It is extremely disappointing that anyone should receive public and personal criticism - or online abuse - simply for applying for a job at the BBC. Nadine Dorries was a prolific user of Twitter before she became a minister, and her back catalogue will make interesting reading now that she is culture secretary. Here is a tweet from December 2017, suggesting that the “war on woke” launched by Oliver Dowden when he was secretary is likely to continue. And she posted this about the BBC in March 2018. Again, this suggests continuity with the Dowden regime. See 10.30am. No 10 has confirmed that Nadine Dorries is the new culture secretary. (See 4.36pm.) And No 10 has confirmed that Oliver Dowden will be minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office. That is the government title that Amanda Milling had alongside her party title as co-chair. Dowden is reportedly becoming Tory co-chair too. No 10 has confirmed that Mark Spencer is staying as chief whip. The FT’s Jim Pickard has posted a tweet implying you could see this as a ratings-related reshuffle, or one that seemed to give party members the final say. (But the thesis does not quite work because he has not included Robert Buckland.) Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is going to replace Amanda Milling as Conservative party chair, or co-chair, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Milling was doing the job alongside Ben Elliott, who is not an MP. The key point in the reaction to the appointment of Dominic Raab to the justice brief from Derek Sweeting QC, chair of the Bar Council, lies in the last sentence, in which he calls for someone to make the position their own. He points out that Raab is the eighth lord chancellor in 10 turbulent years for the justice system. Sweeting said: Robert Buckland MP QC has been lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice at a time when the justice system has faced unprecedented challenges. The Bar Council has worked closely with him and the Ministry of Justice during his time in office. We are grateful for his willingness, as a former practising barrister, to work collaboratively and listen to the legal professions. We wish him well and look forward to working with his successor Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP, also a qualified lawyer. As we welcome the eighth justice secretary in the last 10 years to play this vital role, the need for a consistent and strong voice in government for our justice system could not be greater. Nadine Dorries may be the next culture secretary, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Dorries, currently a health minister, is a very successful fiction writer, which means she would be better qualified to represent the creative industries than many other people who have done that job. But she is also rightwing and pro-Brexit - two traits that might make her less welcome in the arts world. Michael Gove is the new housing secretary, No 10 has announced. As well as being the new secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, he will also take on “cross-government responsibility for levelling up” while he “retains ministerial responsibility for the union and elections”. He was at the Cabinet Office where he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Michael Gove will move from the Cabinet Office to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, which is also becoming the levelling-up department, the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith reports. This is from ITV’s Anushka Asthana on Liz Truss’s promotion. And this is from the FT’s Philip Stephens. (King Charles Street is where the Foreign Office is based.) Nadine Dorries, the health minister, and Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minister, have gone in to Downing Street. Zahawi has been tipped as the next party chair. Sir Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the Commons justice committee, thinks Robert Buckland did not deserve to be sacked, Sky’s Jon Craig reports. This is from David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, on his new opposite number, Dominic Raab. Appointing a failed foreign secretary who was fired for being missing in action to be the sixth justice secretary in six years shows how little this government cares about victims of crime. Under this government, the crown court backlog has reached a record-high, while the number of rape convictions are at a record-low. Victims need a justice secretary who is capable of fixing the courts crisis the government created, not one who has been open about his opposition to the fundamental rights and freedoms that the public depends on. And this is from Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem justice spokesperson. There is no justice in this promotion. Raab is the latest member of this Tory government to be rewarded for failure. After his catastrophic handling of the Afghanistan crisis, he should be out of government altogether. Raab has spent his career attacking the Human Rights Act and trying to undermine our cherished British freedoms. Liberal Democrats will not let him use his new position to roll back our rights. Downing Street has confirmed Liz Truss’s appointment as foreign secretary. Liz Truss is the next foreign secretary, the Times’ Steven Swinford reports. That is is big promotion for the international trade secretary. But the move will be popular with Tory members, who have regularly rated her as the best performing member of the cabinet. (See 2.26pm.) These are from ITV’s Robert Peston. Priti Patel is staying as home secretary, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. UPDATE: No 10 has just confirmed this. Rishi Sunak is staying as chancellor, No 10 has confirmed. No one thought he wasn’t. Downing Street has confirmed that Robert Buckland, Robert Jenrick and Gavin Williamson have all been sacked. A spokesperson said they have all “now left government”. The spokesperson went on: Robert Buckland has made a huge contribution to government as justice secretary and lord chancellor, including making our streets safer through significant reforms to sentencing and tackling reoffending. The prime minister is grateful for his hard work and dedication. Robert Jenrick has led crucial work over the last two years, most importantly driving reforms to build more houses so home ownership becomes a reality for many more people. The prime minister is grateful for his drive and commitment. Gavin Williamson has played a key role in transforming the skills agenda as we create a high wage and high skilled economy, providing a lifetime skills guarantee for millions across the country. The prime minister is grateful for his loyalty and service. Downing Street has confirmed that Dominic Raab is becoming justice secretary and deputy PM. It says the Queen has approved his appointment as “deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, and secretary of state for justice”. He seems to have lost the first secretary of state title, but arguably deputy PM is just a fancier version of first secretary of state. Most cabinets have someone seen as the de facto deputy PM, but very few people had the job as a formal title. The last person was Nick Clegg. Because of the nature of the coalition, he had some clout. If he had gone, he could have collapsed the coalition. For other people, the title has been more cosmetic. Geoffrey Howe was made deputy prime minister when (like Raab) he was moved from foreign secretary. Howe also had another, more junior job (leader of the Commons). Being deputy prime minister sounded important, but Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher’s press secretary, briefed that the title was essentially meaningless. Dominic Raab is moving from foreign secretary to justice secretary, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. That would be a demotion. But she also says he is being made deputy prime minister, as well as retaining his first secretary of state title, which arguably would count as a promotion. UPDATE: The Spectator’s James Forsyth has heard the same. These are from ITV’s Carl Dinnen. And this was from the FT’s Sebastian Payne a few minutes ago. Amanda Milling has refused to say if she has been sacked, Sky’s Jon Craig reports. Sky’s Jon Craig thinks Amanda Milling may be sacked from her post as Conservative party co-chair. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader and chair of the joint committee on human rights, has paid tribute to Robert Buckland. And Jess Phillips, the shadow minister of domestic violence, has complimented Buckland too. I may have missed them, but I have not seen tweets from Labour MPs saying anything similar about Gavin Williamson or Robert Jenrick. These are from Danny Shaw, the former BBC home affairs correspondent, on the departure of Robert Buckland. The Times’ Henry Zeffman says the big losers from the reshuffle so far were all key Boris Johnson supporters in the past. (Eventually Johnson ends up letting down almost everyone, although of course there is much to be said for a PM not letting personal loyalty get in the way get in the way of appointing the best ministers.) Why was Robert Jenrick forced out? His sacking was probably more in the Gavin Williamson mode than the Robert Buckland mode. (See 2.26pm.) Although loyal to Boris Johnson, and said to be well regarded by his wife Carrie, Jenrick has been associated with a series of gaffes or scandals, and was seen as lucky to keep his job after intervening in a planning decision to help the billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond. Jenrick’s move was subsequently ruled unlawful. Jenrick is also in charge of the planning bill. But his initial plans to create a presumption in favour of development in some areas have horrified green belt Tories, and a rethink is now underway. Robert Jenrick has been sacked from his post as housing, communities and local government secretary. From the Sun’s Harry Cole Two cabinet ministers have been sacked now, but the circumstances of their departure are very different. Gavin Williamson was widely expected to go as education secretary because his performance in the post was seen as seen as poor, and at time disastrous. He has regularly come bottom, by a long way, in the ConservativeHome survey of how party members rank the performance of cabinet ministers. Here are the latest ratings. According to Sky, Williamson was offered an alternative post by Boris Johnson, but refused to take a demotion. Robert Buckland is different. In a cabinet not seen as one of history’s ablest or most impressive, he was regarded as a solid performer, and Conservative party members were relatively pleased with his performance. But Buckland’s problem may have been that he was dispensable. He voted remain, and unlike other cabinet remainers, has never pretended to go through an ideological conversion to the Vote Leave cause. Although liked by colleagues, he does not have supporters likely to cause trouble if he leaves the government. And, unlike some in government, he did not seem keen on waging war on the judiciary. The Conservative manifesto proposed limiting the scope of judicial review, as part of an attack on what Tories describe as “judicial activism”, but Buckland, a QC himself, only seemed to have limited enthusiasm for this. He appointed an independent commission to consider the issue, but it ended up proposing just limited reforms. Buckland may also have been a bed-blocker, because there is speculation that Johnson wanted him out so he could offer his job to Dominic Raab. Robert Buckland confirms he has been sacked from his post as justice secretary. His tweet makes it clear that he is definitely leaving the government. These are from Branwen Jeffreys, the BBC’s education editor, on Gavin Williamson. Boris Johnson is now back at No 10, according to Steve Back, who tweets as @PoliticalPics. Robert Buckland is being moved from his post as justice secretary, Sky suggests. From ITV’s Robert Peston Gavin Williamson has confirmed he is no longer education secretary. The line in the second tweet about “continuing to support the prime minister and the government” implies that Williamson is returning to the backbenches, but he has not said that explicitly. Williamson expected to be moved, but reportedly was angling for another job, such as leader of the Commons, or Northern Ireland secretary. The current co-party chair is Amanda Milling, and she has been seen not far from the PM’s office in the Commons, the Times’ Eleni Courea. Milling has been tipped for a move. Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minister, has arrived in the Commons, the Sun’s Harry Cole reports. Zahawi is tipped for promotion - possibly to Conservative party chair. Here is more on what might be happening to Dominic Raab. From ITV’s Robert Peston Oliver Dowden, currently culture secretary, is due to be giving a speech in Cambridge this afternoon. He is still going, Sky’s Beth Rigby says. Downing Street has confirmed that the government hopes to complete cabinet-level appointments today, with more junior posts to follow tomorrow. Dominic Raab is seeing the PM now, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. With the reshuffle now under way, today’s PMQs will probably be a hazy memory long before teatime. That will be a pity because it was a useful guide to how the dividing lines are settling on three key issues. Theo Bertram, a former Labour aide, thinks No 10 deliberately confirmed the reshuffle near the end of the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges because Johnson was doing so badly. There may be something in that, but the reshuffle confirmation was going to come very soon anyway, and the attention of the lobby was always going to move on. Betram is right about Johnson floundering badly when Starmer asked him about the universal credit cuts. Johnson had no realistic answer at all to the question about how people who face losing around £1,000, and that showed by the fact that he reverted to making an irrelevant point about lockdown. He also falsely claimed that all claimants would lose under Labour because the party wants to abolish universal credit. They wouldn’t, because Labour wants to make the benefits system more generous, but Starmer did not make this point, and the exchange suggests that the pledge to abolish UC could be a policy albatross - particularly given that (as far as anyone can tell) Labour just wants to reform UC, not abandon it altogether. (It has taken almost a decade to implement and is still being rolled out, and almost no one in the welfare system would want to start again from scratch.) Starmer easily had the better of Johnson in these exchanges, but the Tory cheering kept the PM afloat and he did not look particularly humbled. But he did come across as someone who has not fully acknowledged quite how much financial pain his government is about to inflict on millions. The second half of the Johnson/Starmer exchanges focused on the health and social care levy, and here Johnson was stronger. Starmer has firmed up his attack lines from last week, although his panto-style call and response routine did not quite work. (It is not something they try in court, one imagines.) But Johnson has sharpened his attack line too, and he sounded much more comfortable labelling Labour as a party that voted against £36bn for the NHS. And he boiled it down to “Vote Labour, wait longer”, which was more pithy and memorable than any of Starmer’s phrase-making today. A third issue came up when Johnson claimed that the Tories were now the party of high wages and controlled immigration, while Labour were the opposite. It won’t feel like this to people affected by the UC cut, or who see their pay rises swallowed up by inflation, but it is notable because it shows Johnson seeking to make a virtue of the labour shortages that have been good for HGV drives seeking a pay rise (but less good for shoppers and traders). Kemi Badenoch, who doubles up as equalities minister and a Treasury minister, has been spotted outside the PM’s office in the Commons, according to the Times’ Eleni Courea. Badenoch has been tipped for education secretary. From ITV’s Carl Dinnen Gavin Williamson was one of two cabinet ministers conspicuously missing from the frontbench during PMQs. The other was Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, another minister tipped for demotion. Raab is first secretary of state (theoretically the de facto deputy PM) as well as foreign secretary. It is possible that he could be moved out of the Foreign Office, but allowed to keep the first secretary of state title, in a way that would make any move look less like a demotion. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has already given a leaving speech, according to HuffPost’s Sophia Sleigh. Sarah Jones (Lab) asks about constituents being charged £23,000 to remove dangerous cladding who do not get government help because it is the wrong type of cladding. Johnson says, if people do not need to remove that cladding, they will not get help. He says too many flats have been deemed unsafe. And that’s it. PMQs is over, and Johnson is off to get started on the sackings. (See 12.22pm.) Neil Parish (Con) asks the government to back public procurement for British food. Johnson backs the idea, says Parish himself is the living embodiment of the virtues of British food. He says all embassies now have a food envoy. Johnson says the future of work under Labour is low skills and law wages, driven by high immigration. Andrew Bridgen (Con) asks about government support for nuclear power. Johnson says the government is waiting for the Rolls Royce consortium to come forward with a fully worked out plan. Jamie Stone (Lib Dem) asks the PM to back a space project in Sutherland. Johnson welcomes the project. It needs a suitable payload, he says. He says Keir Starmer would be suitable. Kieran Mullan (Con) asks the PM to attend a meeting on the geothermal sector. Johnson says he is very interested in these projects, and will hold a meeting. Jack Dromey (Lab) asks about the proposed GKN factory closure in Birmingham. Johnson says the business secretary is looking at this. But the future for the automative sector in the UK is bright, he says. The country is moving towards electric vehicles. That will drive high-skilled jobs, he says. Bob Blackman (Con) asks the PM to back the Scouts movement, and praises its new youth wing, the Squirrels. Johnson says this initiative is fantastic. Nadia Whittome (Lab) says she was able to take time off to recover form PTSD. But other people cannot do this. Will the PM agree to raise sick pay to a level where people can live on it? Johnson says most people who are ill get more than statutory sick pay. Mark Harper, the chair of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, says testing for children is interrupting their education. Does the PM agree? Johnson says the government still thinks testing is a good way of keeping schools open, which is the best thing for pupils. Anum Qaisar-Javed (SNP) asks the PM to join her in thanking health staff who fight childhood cancer. And will he attend a meeting to discuss how funding can be increased. Johnson says not a family in the country has not been touched by this. He endorses what Qaisar-Javed said. Kim Leadbeater (Lab) asks if the PM accepts the UC cuts will impact on people’s mental health. Johnson says it would not. He says Labour would abolish UC altogether. Neil Hudson (Con) asks if the PM will back plans to rebuild a community college in his constituency. Johnson says 100 rebuild projects are underway already. And he says Cumbria county council has been awarded £5m for projects including this one. Johnson says the UK has cut its dependency on coal from 40% to 1%. Sir Roger Gale (Con) asks about a local farm that has had to trash its produce because of a shortage of pickers. Will the PM introduce a Covid recovery visa so that crops are not lost? Johnson says he supports buying British and eating British. He says the government wants to take steps to ensure farms get the labour they need. Tom Randall (Con) asks if there will be a review of maternity services in Nottinghamshire. Johnson says a review is going ahead. Chris Byrant (Lab) says there are not enough NHS doctors to save lives by dealing with the cancer backlog. Johnson says the government is hiring more doctors and nurses. He urges Bryant to support the NHS funding package announced last week. A No 10 source told journalists: The PM will today conduct a reshuffle to put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic. Yesterday the PM set out his plan for managing Covid during the autumn and winter. But the government must also redouble our efforts to deliver on the people’s priorities. The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country. Chris Green (Con) says, now the move to a national ID card has started, nationalists will use them to break up the union. Johnson says he is opposed to ID cards. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says inflation is at is highest rate for a decade. Prices are going up when workers can least afford it. There is a Tory poverty pandemic that will only get worse. How much will welfare cuts cost the average nurse? Johnson says the government is protected the wages of people on low income by freezing fuel duty and supporting childcare. The government is investing massively in health and social care, he says. Blackford says the PM either does not know the answer to the question, or does not care. The average nurse will lose more than £1,000, he says. The PM does not know how much his cuts will hit people, and the DWP secretary does not know how the system works. He says any Scottish Tory MPs with a backbone would be advised to find it. Or has the PM brought them off with the promise of a job. Johnson says nurses have access to a training bursary worth £5,000, and another bursary worth £3,000 for childcare. And their pay has gone up 3%, he says. He says if Blackford is really saying the SNP is opposed to that investment, he would be better off banging on about a referendum. Johnson says the government is working to address the lorry driver shortage. It has changed the licensing rules. After a long period of stagnation for drivers, they are seeing wages going up. Labour is opposed to that, he says. Starmer says he wonders what people facing a £1,000 cut will make of that. The fact is that taxes are going up, national insurance up, council tax up and energy prices up. The PM could change course and vote with Labour against the universal credit cut earlier. Johnson says the panto season has come earlier. (Some Labour MPs were chanting up with Starmer.) Johnson does his own version: the highest employment in the G7, employment up, wages up. He says Starmer is due to publish a 14,000 word essay on his philosophy. Having listened to Starmer he can compress those 14,000 words to four: vote Labour, wait longer. He says his plan for jobs is working, his plan for Covid is working. Starmer says an unfair tax that will not fix social care is not a plan. He says some low paid workers will lose £1,000 a year under the universal credit cut. Yet the government has wasted billions on contracts for cronies, he says. Johnson says the government is paying nurses more, hiring more of them, and putting £36bn into the NHS. One person in 10 is on an NHS waiting list. He says Labour has no plan for that. Starmer says low paid people cannot work the extra hours to recoup the money. And they would need to do that because of the broken tax system. For every extra pound earned, the government will take 75p. Why is the PM hammering them with a tax rise? Johnson claims payments are being increased. He claims it was incredible that the party of Nye Bevan voted against more money for the NHS last week. They do not have a plan to fix the NHS, he says. Starmer says people would have to work an extra nine hours to make up the money. That is an extra day. How will people find the time? Johnson says the government is taking measures to raise wages. It is investing in skills. The government wants a high wage economy, with controlled immigration. Labour wants low wages and uncontrolled immigration, he says. Starmer says Johnson did not answer the question. The work and pensions secretary thinks the answer is two hours. Is the correct answer higher or lower? Johnson says wages are rising. Labour want to take money from people and put them into higher benefits. Johnson says he wants people to earn more. He praises a Costa Coffee initiative and says if we had listened to “Captain Hindsight” (Starmer) we would still be in lockdown. Sir Keir Starmer offers his condolences following the death of the PM’s mother and asks how many extra hours someone on universal credit would have to work to make up for the £20 they will lose under the government’s cut. Johnson says every single UC claimant would lose under the Labour’s plan because they want to abolish the benefit. Caroline Nokes (Con) asks about children affected by sodium valproate. Johnson says the government is committed to accepting the recommendations of the Cumberlege Review, that considered this. Boris Johnson starts by congratulating Emma Raducanu and other players for their victories in the US Open. PMQs is starting shortly. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here is some more reshuffle comment/speculation. From the FT’s Sebastian Payne From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Telegraph’s Cat Neilan From the Daily Mirror’s Rachel Wearmouth Three sources have told the Guardian that Boris Johnson is planning to finally overhaul his cabinet with a reshuffle later today. There has been no denial from Downing Street and civil servant are on high alert for a change of secretary of state in their department. Diaries have been cleared and “first day” plans for inducting new ministers are at the ready. Special advisers - whose jobs often depend on whether their minister gets to keep their job - are also conceding they expect a reshuffle today. After weeks of speculation, it could be that Wednesday is finally the day. Some believe the timing makes sense because Johnson is away at the UN general assembly meeting next week, parliament is soon to break up for conference recess, and an overhaul of the cabinet is badly needed. However, others have been sceptical, thinking it would be difficult to move ministers just weeks before Conservative party conference where they are due to make major speeches, ahead of the spending review and before Cop26 in November. “At least it will - finally - be gotten out of the way,” one exasperated frontbencher said. This is from the Times’s George Grylls. Paul Goodman has a good guide to some of the issues affecting reshuffle decisions in a ConservativeHome article here. This is from Sky’s Sam Coates on the reshuffle. And these are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has claimed the plan B contingency measures announced by the government yesterday will be “hopeless” if Covid cases get out of control. In a statement he argued the measures in the autumn and winter plan would make another lockdown more likely, not less likely. He said: People looking at this so-called winter Covid plan B will be deeply concerned that the government still doesn’t understand how to control this virus. Time after time throughout this pandemic the government has acted too late, failing to provide people with the right support and failing to control the virus, costing tens of thousands of lives. Plan B is the same thing all over again, these measures will be hopeless once the virus is already out of control. If the prime minister isn’t careful he will leave the country sleepwalking into another winter lockdown. Our economy, our children and our carers cannot afford yet another dangerous Covid surge. Dr David Nabarro, World Health Organization special envoy for Covid, said this morning that he was unhappy about the UK government’s decision to vaccinate 12- to 15-year-olds. He told Sky News that he thought those vaccine supplies would be better used in the developing world. He said: I actually think that we should be using the scarce amounts of vaccine in the world today to make sure that everybody at risk, wherever they are, is protected ... Now, some countries giving lots of vaccine and doing boosters and giving it to some children - I find that difficult because from my point of view, as somebody who’s responsible for world issues, I just can’t distinguish between a person in the UK or a person in Uruguay who’s at risk of the disease - I want to see the vaccine available to everybody. The Commons culture committee has urged the government to block Paul Dacre, the former Daily Mail editor, from re-applying to be chair of Ofcom. In a statement issued this morning, the Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the committee, said it was “extremely alarming” that the government was minded to let Dacre apply again after his application was rejected earlier this year by an application board. Dacre, a fierce supporter of Brexit who in the past has been critical of supposed leftish bias in the BBC, is understood to be Boris Johnson’s preferred candidate for the post, which would put him in charge of the body responsible for regulating broadcasting. But earlier this year the interview panel set up to vet the final four candidates for the job decided that Dacre was “not appointable”. Rather than appoint one of the other three top candidates, Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, decided to re-run the contest to give Dacre a second chance. This morning Knight released the text of a letter he has sent, on behalf of his committee, to the culture department saying the new recruitment process defines the qualities needed in the next Ofcom chair in almost identical terms to the way the job was described in the original job specification. But normally when a recruitment process for a post like this is re-run, previous candidates deemed unsuitable are told not to reapply. The culture department has not done that in this case, but Knight said it should. In a statement he said: The DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] committee has once again had to raise important concerns around the appointments process for the new chair of Ofcom. The recruitment process is being re-run despite the absence of any adequate explanation being provided by government on the need to do so. Where a previous candidate has been deemed to be unappointable for a post, they should be ruled out of re-applying. However, this crucial line is missing from the campaign information to recruit Ofcom’s next chair. It would be extremely alarming if this was a deliberate omission rather than an oversight and we are seeking clarification. In his morning interviews Sajid Javid, the health secretary, also said Covid restrictions would return if the virus got “out of control” again this year. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti has the story here. The Scottish parliament’s governing body is refusing to back down on “unjustified” plans which could affect protesters outside the Holyrood building, as the Scottish Greens – who signed a cooperation deal with the SNP government last month – demand a rethink. The parliament’s governing body has insisted it is not seeking to limit or curb protest outside the Holyrood building, after serious objections have been raised by opposition parties, legal experts and campaigners over plans to make the parliament a “protected site”. This would give the building the protection already in place for the House of Commons and the Welsh Senedd and would give Police Scotland the authority to remove protesters who were there without lawful authority and impose fines. Holyrood’s corporate body has refused to publish its reasons, and yesterday Green MSP Gillian Mackay argued in the chamber that there had been no consultation with MSPs or the public. But Scottish Labour MSP Claire Baker, speaking for the body, “categorically” assured fellow MSPs that people’s right to protest outside parliament would not change. With the Scottish Lib Dems also demanded more detail on how the plans will work, this row looks set to run. There is increasing speculation that Boris Johnson may start on his reshuffle after PMQs today. This is from ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston. And this is from his BBC counterpart, Laura Kuenssberg. Good morning. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been doing a morning interview round this morning, and he has been asked why Conservative ministers and MPs are so reluctant to wear masks. It is because when they are at Westminster they are not with strangers, he said. This is what he told Sky News when asked why no one was wearing a mask at yesterday’s crowded cabinet meeting. That is perfectly consistent with what the prime minister said yesterday and what I said yesterday, because what we said was that people should consider wearing masks in crowded places when they are with strangers, when they are with people that they are normally spending time with. And he used the same argument when asked why so few Conservative MPs wear masks in the Commons chamber (even though the parliamentary authorities say wearing a mask there is “strongly advised”). He told Times Radio: I think people should just use their judgment. Be sensible. If you are in crowded places with poor ventilation with strangers, people that you just don’t know, people should consider wearing a mask and we’ve been clear about that from July. But equally if you’re with people that you’re regularly with and most people are vaccinated or you’ve good reason to believe that they are, you can take a different approach. The government’s autumn and winter Covid plan (pdf) published yesterday does advise wearing a face covering “in crowded and enclosed settings where you come into contact with people you do not normally meet”. But Labour has mocked Javid for suggesting that people might not catch Covid from someone they know. This is from the deputy party leader, Angela Rayner. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Lord Deben, chair of the climate change committee, gives evidence to the Commons housing, communities and local government committee. 10.15am: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee. 10.30am: Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Lords justice and home affairs committee. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs start debating a Labour motion saying the £20 per week cut to universal credit planned for next month should be abandoned. The vote will be at about 4pm. 2pm: Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, and other Greater Manchester leaders hold a press conference on Covid.

If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

Politicians in Wales have denounced the move, with one accusing the Welsh government of selling out to London and the nuclear lobby. They have called on ministers to commit to further radiological tests before giving consent for the process, which is crucial for the construction of Hinkley Point C across the estuary in Somerset. In 2013, an assessment by the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences found that tests on the mud, carried out under International Atomic Energy Agency procedures, revealed only minimal levels of radioactivity, well within safety guidelines. “From radiological considerations, there is no objection to this material being dredged and dumped,” the assessment concluded. But John Thomas, leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said concerns had been raised about the adequacy of the assessment. He has called for an urgent meeting with Natural Resources Wales, which approved the dredging licence, and the Welsh government. An independent marine pollution researcher, Tim Deere-Jones, who is also a prominent nuclear power critic, has warned that the dumped sediment could re-concentrate into more powerful radioactive material and be washed ashore in storm surges. “We know sediment in mudflats can dry out and blow ashore and that fine sediment with radioactivity attached can transfer to the land in marine aerosols and sea spray,” Deere-Jones said. Studies of north Wales tidal surges, he added, had revealed that the deposited mud and sand were heavily contaminated with radioactivity from Sellafield. The mud to be dredged contains 50-year-old deposits from Hinkley Point A, where radioactive material for Britain’s atomic weapons was produced. Nuclear historian Dr David Lowry said some of the plutonium produced at the plant was sent to the US in a controversial and confidential exchange. “That deal is coming back to haunt today’s nuclear industry as plans for the third generation of nuclear plants at Hinkley are literally running into the sparkling radioactive mud,” Lowry said. The dredging licence was granted to EDF, the company building the new plant, in 2013. It gives the French energy giant the right to discharge materials at Cardiff Grounds, a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. EDF needs to clear the sediment to allow barges to bring in construction materials. Neil McEvoy, Plaid Cymru Welsh Assembly member, who has received a briefing from Deere-Jones, said dredging should be suspended until a full environmental impact assessment had been carried out. A petition has gained enough signatures to force the assembly to debate the issue. “The problem lies with the unknown,” McEvoy said. “No dose of non-naturally occurring radiation is safe. What we have here is big business trampling over Wales, with a Welsh government doffing its cap to London and the nuclear industry,” he said. “The Welsh national interest is not being served here. The public is outraged that this material will be dumped in Cardiff’s waters, and washed around the Welsh coast, with transfer of radioactivity from sea to land.” An EDF spokesman said: “We have undertaken a number of assessments as part of this application which concluded the activities pose no threat to human health or the environment. All activities on our sites are strictly controlled and regulated by a number of statutory bodies to ensure the environment and public are protected.” John Wheadon, of Natural Resources Wales, said: “There are strict conditions in the licence to test the sediment, including a radiological assessment, before it can be deposited. We will only allow the work to start if we’re confident the activity will not harm people and the environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-does-tehran-say-and-what-happens-next","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-08T13:38:57Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal: what has Tehran said and what happens next?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-does-tehran-say-and-what-happens-next","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-does-tehran-say-and-what-happens-next","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal: what has Tehran said and what happens next?","bodyText":"What has Iran announced? Iran has suspended commitments it made under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on the country in exchange for limits on Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal was reached after years of negotiations. Hassan Rouhani, president of Iran, said Tehran would hang on to its stocks of excess enriched uranium and heavy water instead of exporting them. He threatened to resume enriching uranium above a limit set out in the deal unless there was progress on sanctions relief. What did the deal say about these commitments? The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, set out a 3.67% limit for uranium enrichment (enough to fuel a commercial nuclear power plant) and barred Iran from accumulating stocks of more than 300kg of low-enriched uranium and 130 tonnes of heavy water, a coolant used in nuclear reactors. In theory, uranium enriched to much higher levels of purity than Iran’s current stocks could be used as the fissile core of a nuclear weapon, while heavy water is a source of plutonium, which can be used to produce a warhead. Why has Iran done this now? Iran is suffering under crippling sanctions restored by the US after Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last year. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded on Wednesday at 153,500. Tehran rightly said the deal had been premised on ending Iran’s economic isolation in exchange for strict and verified limitations on its nuclear activities. By re-imposing sanctions with extraterritorial effects the US has scared companies and banks around the world into reducing, ceasing or not starting business with Iranian counterparts. The US last week also removed waivers on nuclear co-operation with Iran, including the shipment abroad of excess supplies, perversely making it much harder for Iran to keep to the stockpile limits. The economic crisis has increased internal pressure on Rouhani, a relative moderate within Iran’s Shia theocracy, to take some sort of counter action. His policy of waiting for Trump to be succeeded by a nuclear deal-friendly Democrat as US president in 18 months’ time was failing, and he will hope that he is now shielded from criticism from hardliners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal. The Iranians felt they had given the Europeans ample time to come up with a mechanism that would foster trade between the EU and Iran immunised from the threat of American sanctions. Does this spell the end of the agreement? Not yet. The Iranians have set out a timetable for a staged withdrawal from the agreement dependent upon the actions of the EU. “This surgery is to save the [deal] not destroy it,” Rouhani said. He has also said the actions are justifiable under articles of the deal which set out the countermeasures party could take if another party was clearly in breach of their obligations. Iran has not done anything to restrict UN inspection of its compliance or to increase research on advanced centrifuges – two steps that might be seen as EU red lines. What will the Americans do? The White House will be delighted that its maximum pressure campaign has finally made the Iranians crack. The US will use this as a lever to prise the EU away from the agreement, or at least to demand that the EU impose sanctions of its own. Speculation mounts that some Washington figures, such as John Bolton, the national security adviser, is trying to assemble a case for war with Tehran as he did against Iraq in 2002. If there is a single over-riding American foreign policy at present it is hostility to Iran. Where does the EU stand? Europe collectively has heavily invested in diplomacy with Iran and regards the nuclear deal as the high-water mark of multilateralism. Washington’s European allies say Trump’s repudiation of the deal weakens the pragmatic wing of Iran’s leadership and plays into the hands of hardliners. It means the public in Iran see no economic benefits from Rouhani’s efforts to open the country. The EU has long had doubts about Tehran’s missile programme, and activities in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, but they are viewed separately from the nuclear agreement. Is there a resolution? It is not evident. Europe has been served notice by Tehran that it must deliver on its commitments to help the Iranian economy, but given the dollar-dominated global economy EU banks and firms are never going to choose trading with Iran over trading with the US, which is the choice the US treasury is placing before them. The French may make calls for greater European economic sovereignty, but changing the dollar’s dominance is a work of two decades and not two months, the time-frame set by Rouhani."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/mar/08/back-in-the-water-fukushima-no-go-zone-gets-first-surf-shop-since-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-08T05:14:03Z","webTitle":"Back in the water: Fukushima no-go zone gets first surf shop since disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/08/back-in-the-water-fukushima-no-go-zone-gets-first-surf-shop-since-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/mar/08/back-in-the-water-fukushima-no-go-zone-gets-first-surf-shop-since-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Back in the water: Fukushima no-go zone gets first surf shop since disaster","bodyText":"There was a time when Shinji Murohara thought he would never again surf along the coast where he grew up. On 11 March 2011, the waves of the Pacific that gave him his love of the sea suddenly, violently left his community in ruins. That afternoon, a massive earthquake triggered a tsunami along Japan’s north-east coast that killed almost 19,000 people, including about 600 in his home town of Minamisoma, Fukushima prefecture. Not long after, Murohara and other residents in the city’s Odaka district were ordered to leave as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 15km (9 miles) to the south, suffered meltdowns in three of its reactors. But, as Japan prepares to mark eight years since the triple disaster, Fukushima is again showing why many consider it the best surfing spot in Japan. “As someone who grew up around here, it was tough having to look at the sea knowing that I couldn’t pull on my wetsuit and get out there,” says Murohara, who recently opened a shop in Odaka selling surfboards he makes in a nearby workshop. His is the only surf shop to open inside the 20km area that was declared a no-go zone in the aftermath of the triple meltdown. His regular spot, Kitaizumi beach, remained officially off-limits until the nuclear evacuation order was lifted in Odaka two years ago. Even in nearby areas that had been declared safe for residents to return, surfers battled the waves along with criticism that they were taking unnecessary risks with their health. “Some people wanted to start surfing at Kitaizumi straight after the disaster,” says Hideki Okumoto, a regular surfer and professor at Fukushima University. “They said they would take personal responsibility for any health risks from radiation.” But they faced another obstacle. Beneath the waves lay tonnes of tsunami wreckage and, perhaps, the trapped remains of missing victims. “It didn’t seem right to use the sea for leisure so soon after the disaster,” Okumoto adds. Their cue came three years after the disaster, when a Buddhist ceremony was held to officially mark the repose of the souls of the dead. “It felt great to be able to surf again,” says Murohara, who lived as an evacuee for five years before returning to Odaka to rebuild his surfboard business. Both men dismiss concerns that the sea has been contaminated by water leaking from Fukushima Daiichi. “The city government tests the sand and water every month and we conduct our own regular tests,” says Okumoto, who believes that had it not been for the meltdown, Fukushima would have been chosen to host the surfing competition when it makes its Olympic debut at the Tokyo 2020 Games. “Radiation returned to pre-disaster levels years ago.” But he adds: “I understand why people from outside might feel uneasy about surfing in Fukushima, but we prefer to believe the scientific evidence. What else can we do?” Surfers from other parts of Japan have turned up for events in a show of solidarity, and now Murohara and Okumoto plan to revive a surfing tourism campaign they had to abandon after the area became a nuclear no-go zone, starting this summer with a tournament and activities for children at Kitaizumi beach. “Children who were born the year of the disaster are eight years old now – they’ve had to wait that long to go into the sea in their home town,” says Murohara, who is head of Fukushima prefecture’s surfing federation. “This is a special place – it had to deal with an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown all at the same time. The sea is part of the fabric of life around here, so now I want to share my love of surfing with the next generation of Fukushima surfers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/jun/25/trump-iran-rouhani-insults-sanctions-threats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-25T17:09:02Z","webTitle":"Trump threatens ‘obliteration’ after Iran suggests he has a ‘mental disorder’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/25/trump-iran-rouhani-insults-sanctions-threats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/jun/25/trump-iran-rouhani-insults-sanctions-threats","fields":{"headline":"Trump threatens ‘obliteration’ after Iran suggests he has a ‘mental disorder’","bodyText":"The Iranian and US presidents have traded insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”. The very personal exchange was reminiscent of similar verbal clashes between the US and North Korean leaders in late 2017, and underlined the volatility of US foreign policymaking in the present standoff in the Gulf. Trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions, while ramping up sanctions. The worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when the US imposed sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and eight military commanders, and threatened measures against the foreign minister, Javad Zarif. On Tuesday, Rouhani responded by describing the US president as “afflicted by a mental disorder” and said the sanctions against Khamenei were “outrageous and idiotic” – especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US. The insult was an echo of Kim Jong-un’s broadside against the US president in September 2017, when he called Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard”. The slanging match between Trump and Kim ultimately gave way to summitry and claims of mutual affection (with Trump even claiming they “fell in love”). The path to a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran, however, looks far more complicated. As it has frequently in the past, the reference to Trump’s mental faculties triggered an emotional response, and a flurry of tweets. “Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he wrote. “The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s &amp; EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” Trump’s estimate of US fatalities is much higher than the Pentagon estimate of 600. Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade embargo. The Trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk. In recent days, Trump has said that offer is without preconditions. However, there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about. State department officials have insisted a wide-ranging list of 12 US demands, including withdrawal from Syria and cutting support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. Zarif on Tuesday restated Iran’s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so. Iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Trump could pick up Zarif’s remarks as a signal to talk. Tehran has warned that on Thursday it will breach the limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Without sanctions relief, it will take a further – potentially more significant – step on 8 July of raising the level at which it enriches uranium, above the 3.67% agreed in 2015. With those potential flashpoints looming, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Rouhani by telephone on Tuesday. Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are expected to try to defuse tensions when they see Trump at the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday. Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America’s diplomacy, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat, by sanctioning Zarif. “Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” the foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.” Speaking in Israel, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door”. Iran’s decision to breach the nuclear deal places the EU in a dilemma: France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington. The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal. They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran – a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions – and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: “It is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.” He also ruled out British involvement in military action. “The US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.” Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. “The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2020/jan/22/terry-jones-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-22T16:31:46Z","webTitle":"Terry Jones obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/22/terry-jones-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2020/jan/22/terry-jones-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Terry Jones obituary","bodyText":"One morning Brian Cohen, completely naked, flung open the shutters at his bedroom window to find a mob below hailing him as the Messiah. Mrs Cohen, played by Terry Jones, who has died aged 77, had something to say about that. “He’s not the Messiah. He’s a very naughty boy,” she told the disappointed crowd. It became a classic cinema moment. The 1979 film Monty Python’s Life of Brian, a satire about an ordinary Jewish boy mistaken for the Messiah, which Jones directed and co-wrote with his fellow Pythons Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Michael Palin, was banned by 39 British local authorities, and by Ireland and Norway. Jones and his chums were unrepentant: they even launched a Swedish poster campaign with the slogan: “So funny it was banned in Norway.” As for Jones’s performance as Mandy Cohen, it united two leading facets of the funnyman’s repertoire: his fondness for female impersonation, and his passion for historical revisionism. The latter was evident not just in his work for Monty Python – in which his historian’s sensibility proved essential to the satire of Arthurian England in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), which he co-directed and co-wrote – but also in several documentaries and books in which he stood up for what he took to be the misrepresented Middle Ages. “We think of medieval England as being a place of unbelievable cruelty and darkness and superstition,” he said. “We think of it as all being about fair maidens in castles, and witch-burning, and a belief that the world was flat. Yet all these things are wrong.” Arguably, without Jones, Monty Python’s Flying Circus (1969-74) would not have revolutionised British TV comedy. He was key in developing the show’s distinctively trippy, stream-of-consciousness format, where each surreal set-up (the Lumberjack Song, the upper-class twit of the year show, the dead parrot, or the fish-slapping dance) flowed into the next, unpunctuated by punchlines. For all his directorial flair, though, Jones may well be best remembered for creating such characters as Arthur “Two Sheds” Jackson, Cardinal Biggles of the Spanish Inquisition, the Scottish poet Ewan McTeagle and the monstrous musician rodent beater in the mouse organ sketch who hits specially tuned mice with mallets. Thanks to the show’s success, Jones was able to diversify into working as a writer, poet, librettist, film director, comedian, actor and historian. “I’ve been very lucky to have been able to act, write and direct and not have to choose just the one thing,” he said. Jones was a second world war baby, born in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, and brought up by his mother, Dilys (nee Newnes), and grandmother, while his father, Alick Jones, was stationed with the RAF in India. He recalled meeting his father for the first time when he returned from war service: “Through plumes of steam at the end of the platform, he appeared – this lone figure in a forage cap and holding a kit bag. He ran over and kissed my mum, then my brother, then bent down and picked me up and planted one right on me. I’d only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing.” When he was four, the family moved to Surrey so his father could take up an appointment as a bank clerk. Terry attended primary school in Esher and the Royal Grammar school in Guildford. He studied English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and developed a lifelong interest in medieval history as a result of reading Chaucer. At Oxford, he started the Experimental Theatre Company with his friend and contemporary Michael Rudman, performing everything from Brecht to cabaret. He also met Palin and the historian Robert Hewson, and collaborated with them on a satire on the death penalty called Hang Down Your Head and Die. It was set in a circus ring, with Jones playing the condemned man. He and Palin then worked together on the Oxford Revue, a satirical sketch show they performed at the 1964 Edinburgh festival, where he met David Frost as well as Chapman, Idle and Cleese. After graduation, he was hired as a copywriter for Anglia Television and then taken on as a script editor at the BBC, where he worked as joke writer for BBC2’s Late Night Line-Up (1964-72). Jones and Palin became fixtures on the booming TV satire scene, writing for, among other BBC shows, The Frost Report (1966-67) and The Kathy Kirby Show (1964), as well as the ITV comedy sketch series Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967-69). In 1967, he and Palin were invited to write and perform for Twice a Fortnight, a BBC sketch show that provided a training ground not only for a third of the Pythons (Jones and Palin), but two-thirds of the Goodies (Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie) and the co-creator of the 1980s political sitcom Yes Minister, Jonathan Lynn. Jones and Palin wrote and starred in The Complete and Utter History of Britain (1969) for LWT. Its conceit was to relate historical incidents as if TV had existed at the time. In one sketch, Samuel Pepys was a chat show host; in another, a young couple of ancient Britons looking for their first home were shown around the brand-new Stonehenge. “It’s got character, charm – and a slab in the middle,” said the estate agent. In the same year, he became one of the six founders of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. They expected the show to be quickly decommissioned by BBC bosses. “Every episode we’d be there biting our nails hoping someone might find it funny. Right up until the middle of the second series John Cleese’s mum was still sending him job adverts for supermarket managers cut out from her local newspaper,” Jones recalled. “It was only when they started receiving sackfuls of correspondence from school kids saying they loved it that we knew we were saved.” After Python finished its run on TV, Jones went on to direct several films with the troupe. The first, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, was, he recalled, “a disaster when we first showed it. The audiences would laugh for the first five minutes and then silence, nothing. So we re-cut it. Then we’d show it in different cities, saying, ‘We’re worried about our film, would you come and look at it?’ And as a result people would come and they’d all be terribly worried about it too, so it was a nightmare.” He had more fun co-writing and directing two series for the BBC called Ripping Yarns (1976-79) in which Palin starred as a series of heroic characters in mock-adventure stories, among them Across the Andes by Frog, and Roger of the Raj, sending up interwar literature aimed at schoolboys. Jones directed and starred in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, which some religious groups denounced for supposedly mocking Christianity. Jones defended the film: “It wasn’t about what Christ was saying, but about the people who followed him – the ones who for the next 2,000 years would torture and kill each other because they couldn’t agree on what he was saying about peace and love.” In 1983 he directed Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life, in which he made, perhaps, his most disgusting appearance, as Mr Creosote, a ludicrously obese diner, who is served dishes while vomiting repeatedly. During this decade Jones diversified, proving there was life after Python. In 1980, he published Chaucer’s Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary, arguing that the supposed paragon of Christian virtue could be demonstrated to be, if one studied the battles Chaucer claimed he was involved in, a typical, perhaps even vicious, mercenary. He also set out to overturn the idea of Richard II presented in the work of Shakespeare “who paints him more like sort of a weak … unmanly character”. Jones portrayed the king as a victim of spin: “There’s a possibility that Richard was actually a popular king,” he said. He wrote children’s books, starting with The Saga of Erik the Viking (1983), which he composed originally for his son, Bill. A book of rhymes, The Curse of the Vampire’s Socks (1989), featured such characters as the Sewer Kangaroo and Moby Duck. In 1987, he directed Personal Services, a film about the madam of a suburban brothel catering for older men, starring Julie Walters. The story was inspired by the experiences of the Streatham brothel-keeper Cynthia Payne. Jones proudly related that three of four films banned in Ireland were directed by him – The Life of Brian, The Meaning of Life and Personal Services. Two years later, he directed Erik the Viking, a film adaptation of his book, with Tim Robbins in the title role of a young Norseman who declines to go into the family line of raping and pillaging. In 1996, he adapted Kenneth Grahame’s Wind in the Willows for the big screen, giving himself the role of Mr Toad, with Ratty and Mole played by Idle and Steve Coogan. But it was rarely screened in cinemas. “It was ruined by studio politicking between Disney and Columbia Tristar,” he said. “We made a really nice film but no one saw it. It didn’t make any money, even though it was well reviewed.” Jones was also unfortunate with his next film project. Absolutely Anything, based on a script he wrote with the screenwriter Gavin Scott, concerned aliens coming to Earth and giving one person absolute power. Plans were scuppered when a movie with a similar premise, Bruce Almighty, starring Jim Carrey, was released in 2003. Only in 2015 did Jones manage to film Absolutely Anything, in which Simon Pegg, playing a mild-mannered schoolteacher, is given miraculous powers by a council of CGI aliens voiced by Jones and his former Monty Python colleagues. Robin Williams, in one of his last roles, voiced Pegg’s dog. Jones made well-received history documentaries, including in 2002 The Hidden History of Egypt, The Hidden History of Rome and The Hidden History of Sex &amp; Love, in which he examined the diets, hygiene, careers, sex lives and domestic arrangements of the ancient world, often appearing in the films as an ancient character, sometimes dressed as a woman. In his book Who Murdered Chaucer? (2003), he wondered if the poet had been killed on behalf of King Henry IV for being politically troublesome. He wrote for the Guardian, about the poll tax, nuclear power and the ozone layer. He became a vocal opponent of the Iraq war, and his articles on the subject were collected under the title Terry Jones’s War on the War on Terror (2004). In his 2006 BBC series Barbarians, Jones sought to show that supposedly primitive Celts and savage Goths were nothing of the kind and that the ancient Greeks and Persians were neither as ineffectual nor as effete as the ancient Romans supposed. Best of all, he sought to demonstrate that it was not the Vandals and other north European tribes who destroyed Rome but Rome itself, thanks to the loss of its African tax base. When Jones was asked what he would like on his tombstone, he did not want to be remembered as a Python, perhaps surprisingly, but for his writing and historical work. “Maybe a description of me as a writer of children’s books or maybe as the man who restored Richard II’s reputation. I think those are my best bits.” In 2016, it was announced that Jones had been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a form of dementia that impairs the ability to communicate. He and his family and friends spoke about his experiences to help others living with the condition. Jones is survived by his second wife, Anna (nee Söderström), whom he married in 2012, and their daughter, Siri; and by Bill and Sally, the children of his first marriage, to Alison Telfer, which ended in divorce. • Terence Graham Parry Jones, writer, actor and director, born 1 February 1942; died 21 January 2020"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/goldman-prize-awarded-to-south-african-women-who-stopped-an-international-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T04:01:01Z","webTitle":"Goldman prize awarded to South African women who stopped an international nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/goldman-prize-awarded-to-south-african-women-who-stopped-an-international-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/goldman-prize-awarded-to-south-african-women-who-stopped-an-international-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"Goldman prize awarded to South African women who stopped an international nuclear deal","bodyText":"Two grassroots women activists – one black, one white – stand together against two of the world’s most powerful men – one black, one white – over a secret, undemocratic, multibillion dollar nuclear deal. If this was the plot of a Netflix series, it might be dismissed as too neat, too perfectly symbolic and symmetrical. But this is the true story of the two South African winners of this year’s Goldman environment prize who tapped their roots in the anti-apartheid struggle to take on and beat an agreement by their nation’s recently deposed leader Jacob Zuma and Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid were the sole signatories of a successful legal challenge against the plan for South Africa to buy up to 10 nuclear power stations from Russia at an estimated cost of 1tn rand ($76bn). After a five-year legal battle, a high court outlawed the deal last April and accepted the plaintiffs’ claims that it had been arranged without proper consultation with parliament. Aside from the immense geopolitical ramifications, the ruling was a vindication for the civil society movement that aims to expand public participation, especially by woman, in energy decision-making. There were risks in confronting the president, the electricity utility and the interests of a foreign power. The two women were warned they could face violence and attacks on their reputation, but they signed the legal papers regardless. “It is important that this campaign is led by women,” Lekalakala said in an interview in Cape Town. “We are getting this [Goldman] prize because we really sacrificed ourselves by putting our names on the line. Others were shit-scared. But we’ve been through so much that we were willing to take the risk.” McDaid, who works for the Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute, said the campaign was a recognition that grassroots action can work. “Governments everywhere like to give the impression that citizens have no power. That’s not true. We have checks and balances and we need to use them.” Both cut their activist teeth in the anti-apartheid struggle of the 1980s. McDaid, then a teacher, was caught up in the Trojan Horse massacre in Athlone, Cape Town. She hid students sought by police in her house and used her car to block troops chasing students. Lekalakala grew up in Soweto, the heartland of the black consciousness movement. She served as a shop steward in a department store when she was 19 years old. She also witnessed some of the worst of the violence, both from the white authorities and black-on-black factional conflict. In the late eighties, an era when alleged apartheid collaborators were being punished with “necklaces” of burning tyres, she was woken by screams in the middle of the night and ffound bodies on the floor in the morning. “That was the hardest time of my life,” she recalls. This background has made the two women relatively fearless. They have both been threatened and suffered break-ins in which alarm systems were expertly dismantled and only their laptops (rather than valuables like jewellery or cameras) were stolen, suggesting the intruders were after information rather than money. “It’s harassment,” said Lekalakala. “But I’m very forceful. I’m used to threats.” The two began working together in 2009 when they joined Earthlife, a group designed to encourage women to become more involved in energy and climate policy-making. For Lekalakala, it was an eye-opening experience. “When I started at Earthlife I was one of the only black women. I thought that was wrong. It is poor black women who are most affected but it is rich white men making all the decisions.” They have proved influential, providing input into the National Energy Act and the climate energy policy. They challenged the long-held view that energy is a technical, engineering matter for specialists rather than ordinary people. “We broke that barrier and we are continuously breaking barriers,” said Lekalakala, who has also campaigned against plans for a coal mine at Thabametsi. They were tipped off about the nuclear deal by the Russian group EcoDefence. Although the South African government had not told the public about the plan, its business partner, state-owned Rosatom initially posted an announcement on its website. This was quickly taken down but not before Earthlife made a copy that they used to rally opposition from environmentalists, faith groups, lawyers, and, the media. Their court victory was a major setback for Putin’s plans to increase Russia’s income and influence, and may have contributed to the fall of Zuma after nine years in power. The president had reportedly fired two finance ministers in part because they were unwilling to approve the $76bn cost of the project. It was also a focus of corruption claims by political enemies and rivals in the ANC, given reports that Zuma’s son was a director of the sole mine that supplied uranium. The new government has signalled a shift in direction. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in Davos this year that the plan to add 9.6 gigawatts of nuclear energy was off the table. More recently, energy minister Jeff Radebe has signed deals that will promote wind and solar power. “The political signs are good that nuclear is not going ahead any time soon,” said McDaid. “But I think this is just a step on the path to a nuclear-free South Africa. There is a long way to go. Success would be for our one existing plant to be decomissioned and for the government to make a nuclear-free declaration.” Lekalakala agrees on the need to stay vigilant because coal - along with nuclear - remains a concern and the government will revisit its energy policy in five years. “Civil society can claim some credit for ensuring the government didn’t run along a nuclear path that would have bankrupted the country,” she said. “We’ll use the Goldman award to further our struggle and build a new generation of activists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jun/12/australia-could-cut-emissions-halfway-to-paris-target-under-global-energy-standards","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-11T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Australia missing out on huge cuts in emissions through energy efficiency failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/12/australia-could-cut-emissions-halfway-to-paris-target-under-global-energy-standards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jun/12/australia-could-cut-emissions-halfway-to-paris-target-under-global-energy-standards","fields":{"headline":"Australia missing out on huge cuts in emissions through energy efficiency failure","bodyText":"Australia could cut greenhouse gas emissions halfway to its Paris agreement target, and save $7.7bn a year in bills, by adopting existing global standards on energy efficiency. From new hot water heaters to better standards for appliances, a new report has found Australia is missing an opportunity to “easily” meet its emissions targets and fight the looming climate crisis. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council (EEC), found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills. It would also create 70,000 extra fulltime equivalent jobs – from advanced engineering to plumbing – as houses are fitted with new boilers, draught-sealing and new lights, and factories invest in efficient equipment. A YouGov survey commissioned by the EEC found that “investing in energy efficiency” is one of the most politically popular actions the government can take on the climate crisis – with more than 85% support among both Labor and Coalition voters. However, Australia is not on track to meet its target of a 40% increase in efficiency by 2030, according to the EEC’s head of policy, Rob Murray-Leach. Since 2015, Australia has only improved an average of 0.7% a year, according to the EEC’s figures – well below the 2.3% rate needed. Murray-Leach said the levers of change were controlled by the states and territories – meaning Australia could still “crack on” even if the federal government was inactive. The report said Australians should start thinking of energy efficiency as a form of energy generation – adding capacity to the grid and reducing power bills. “Energy efficiency is just another form of supply,” Murray-Leach said. “When I look at Germany, their bills are 30% lower”. According to the report, Australia has “barely begun to tap the potential of energy efficiency”, and was the worst developed country for efficiency, out of the top 25 energy-consuming countries. In comparison, China set a target of 20% improvement in only five years between 2006 and 2010, and exceeded it. And California in the 1970s generated the equivalent of two new nuclear power plants of energy, just by improving the efficiency of fridges. “It wasn’t until I went overseas that I realised how far behind we were,” Murray-Leach said. “We have fundamentally dropped the ball on what is seen as the standard way of how you do business. It’s like every other country in the world did accounting, and we just didn’t bother.” The report found that adopting best practice from around the world would “easily deliver half of the abatement required to meet Australia’s target to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030”. And that push would create 120,000 fulltime equivalent jobs, up from the current 50,000. “A lot of energy efficiency jobs are not labelled energy efficiency jobs,” Murray-Leach said. “It’s a builder who 20% of his time is making sure the doors and the roof are keeping the heat in … It’s a lot of different jobs making things work better. “If you are upgrading the efficiency of a factory, you are getting highly skilled chemical and mechanical engineers to go in. If you are talking about draught-proofing a home, you are talking about a skilled tradesman. And if you are increasing the replacement rate of hot water, then those are plumbing jobs.” The report also recommended Australia improve minimum standards for appliances, and implement an energy rating scheme for houses. Australia currently has minimum standards set for 21 kinds of appliances – much less than our biggest trading partners, the US (with 51), the EU (41) and China (also 41). Simply matching those standards would boost trade as well as energy conservation, the report said. In the US, California also updates its building codes every three years to keep new buildings energy efficient. If Australia copied the same building codes as the US or Japan, an office building in Brisbane would be 20% more energy efficient, the report found. It also recommended that houses be given energy efficiency ratings in the same way appliances are, so new buyers and new renters can see how much money they would lose by choosing an energy inefficient home – a scheme the UK has had since 2007. “The research has shown you could easily double energy productivity – so a 100% improvement by 2040, instead of a 40% increase by 2040,” Murray-Leach said. Californian energy commissioner Andrew Mcallister told Guardian Australia “there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in Australia, that in California we have already harvested”. “Energy efficiency advocacy is not really a radical thing,” he said. “It is rational, it is good policy. It is not a partisan thing at all. It’s just good management.” Murray-Leach said much of this could be achieved without the federal government. “The levers for energy management really sit in the hands of states and territories,” he said. States have the power to institute energy-efficiency schemes (which currently exist in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT), can establish new building standards for homes and fund businesses to improve their own efficiency, as has recently happened in NSW. “Queensland can put in an energy efficiency scheme, it can introduce one tomorrow,” Murray-Leach said. “Businesses would prefer to have a national approach to these polices. But the states can coordinate with each other without the federal government. And the cost of inaction would be far worse than being uncoordinated.” The report also recommends that manufacturing businesses be given incentives and grants to improve efficiency, and that the government introduce stronger fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-up-to-100-ukrainians-dying-every-day-in-east-zelenskiy-says-war-to-dominate-davos-meeting-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T23:59:06Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy says Putin is the only Russian official he is willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-up-to-100-ukrainians-dying-every-day-in-east-zelenskiy-says-war-to-dominate-davos-meeting-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-up-to-100-ukrainians-dying-every-day-in-east-zelenskiy-says-war-to-dominate-davos-meeting-live","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy says Putin is the only Russian official he is willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war – as it happened","bodyText":"We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said President Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelenskiy said. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.” A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers are due to face war crimes trials, she said, adding that Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Monday. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. “Low-level” discussions are reportedly underway on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days” and may require capping global oil prices, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. “We will reach a breakthrough within days,” Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF, adding that the European Commission and the United States were working on a proposal to no longer pay “any price” for oil, but to cap global prices. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain, according to a series of images released by Maxar Technologies, seemingly backing up claims from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business in the country for the Seattle-based coffee company. Starbucks currently has 130 stores in Russia and the company employs nearly 2,000 people in the country. McDonalds has also removed the “golden arches” from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. In a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelenskiy said: The president of the Russian Federation decides it all. If we are talking about ending this war without him personally, that decision cannot be taken. I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president. And only in the case when there is one issue on the (table): stopping the war. There are no other grounds for any other kind of meeting.” Zelenskiy added that arranging any talks with Russia was becoming more difficult in light of what he said was evidence of Russian actions against civilians under occupation. Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia was working to replace goods imported from western countries, he said, and in future, would rely only on “reliable” countries not beholden to the west. If they (the west) want to offer something in terms of resuming relations, then we will seriously consider whether we will need it or not,” Lavrov said, according to a transcript on the foreign ministry’s website. Lavrov set down grievances with western countries that he said were determined to change the rules of international relations to Russia’s detriment. We must cease being dependent in any way on supplies of absolutely everything from the West for ensuring the development of critically important sectors for security, the economy or our homeland’s social sphere,” he said. Lavrov said Moscow’s goal now is to further develop ties with China. Now that the west has taken a ‘dictator’s position’, our economic ties with China will grow even faster. In addition to direct revenue for the state budget, this is a chance to develop (Russia’s) far east and eastern Siberia.” China, he said, had information and communications technologies “that are in no way inferior to the west. A great deal here will ensure mutual benefits.” Lavrov said Russia would count on “only ourselves and on countries which have proved themselves reliable and do not ‘dance to some other piper’s music’. If western countries change their minds and propose some form of cooperation, we can then decide.” The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days,” Germany’s economy minister said on Monday, but making a dent in Russia’s war chest may require capping global oil prices. “We will reach a breakthrough within days,” Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF when asked about an EU oil embargo in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He warned, however, that an embargo would not automatically weaken the Kremlin. Rising global oil prices after the United States announced an embargo on Russian oil enabled it to rake in more income while selling lower volumes. Therefore, the European Commission and United States were working on a proposal to no longer pay “any price” for oil, but to cap global prices, he said. “It is obviously an unusual measure, but these are unusual times,” he said. “This path only works if many countries get on board... and that’s proving to be the sticking point.” The United States is still “a ways away” from any possible decision on whether to re-introduce US troops into Ukraine, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Monday, though acknowledged low-level planning underway. President Joe Biden decided to withdraw American troops from Ukraine before Russia’s 24 February invasion in order to avoid a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary. But changing circumstances including a reopening of the US embassy have raised questions about whether US troops may be required to return to help ensure security of diplomats in a country at war. At a news conference, Milley acknowledged some degree of staff planning ahead of a potential decision to send US troops back into Ukraine. That planning hasn’t made it to his level for review or to the level of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin where ultimately, it would be up to Biden. At the end of the day, any reintroduction of US forces into Ukraine would require a presidential decision. So we’re a ways away from anything like that. We’re still developing courses of action, and none of that’s been presented yet to the Secretary.” Milley did not specify whether he was referring to low-level planning for US troops to potentially secure a US diplomatic presence in Ukraine or potentially for other activities as well. Russia’s Roscosmos space agency director general, Dmitry Rogozin, has said the Kuril Islands, a subject of territorial dispute with Japan, could be renamed after Russian ships and events of the early 20th century’s Russo-Japanese war, according to a Reuters report. The territorial dispute over the isles – which Russia says are part of its Kuril chain and which Japan calls its northern territories – has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from reaching a peace treaty formally ending second world war hostilities. Rogozin proposed to change the name of one of the islands to Varyag in honour of a cruiser whose sinking started the Russo-Japanese war in 1904. He also proposed that the Habomai Islands could be called the archipelago of Russian hero sailors. “Always, when states added territories they would give them their own names (... ) Why don’t these islands have Russian names?” Rogozin said on state-owned radio broadcaster Sputnik. “This would be much more logical than the names with which we now have been calling these islands and which destroy the Russian language.” A recording of Russian diplomat to the United Nations in Geneva, Boris Bondarev, has emerged after the official resigned from his position. Bondarev said he had handed in his resignation before sending a scathing letter to foreign colleagues inveighing against the “aggressive war unleashed” by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine. Bondarev, 41, confirmed his resignation in a letter posted on his Facebook page. “For 20 years of my diplomatic career, I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on 24 February of this year,” he wrote, alluding to the date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is just after 1am in Kyiv. Here are the updates going into Tuesday morning: Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, commended Boris Bondarev’s decision to resign and encouraged other Russian officials to do the same. The war in Ukraine has impacted the global economy and could lead to recessions in vulnerable countries, according to the head of International Monetary Fund. After months of providing shelter to residents, the subway system in Kharkiv will begin operating again this week. McDonalds has removed the “golden arches” from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good. Satellite images reportedly show Russian-flagged ships stealing grain from Ukraine, as officials warn of a food crisis that could be felt around the world. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain, CNN reports, backing up claims from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country. The images, which were produced by Maxar Technologies, are from 19 and 21 May. In them, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. From CNN: It’s difficult to know for certain whether the ship is being loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain, but Russia-annexed Crimea produces little grain itself, unlike the agriculturally rich Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia immediately to the north. Ukrainian officials and industry sources have told CNN that Russian forces in occupied areas have emptied several silos and trucked the grain south. Earlier this month, the Matros Pozynich carried out a similar mission: loading up with grain and setting sail out of the Black Sea and into the Mediterranean. It was initially bound for Egypt with its cargo, but it was turned away from Alexandria after a warning from Ukrainian officials, according to the country’s government. It was also barred entry to Beirut, eventually docking in Latakia, in Syria, where Russia has for years been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, Russia has stopped Ukrainian exports from the ports, creating the potential for a global food crisis. With Ukraine a top exporter of wheat and other food products, supply is already becoming strained. “The world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it,” Zelenskiy said over the weekend. McDonald’s world-famous golden arches are coming down in Moscow, Reuters reports, as the fast food chain begins its departure from Russia. After more than three decades, the company is selling the restaurants to a local licensee and they will operate under a different name. From Reuters: McDonald’s had in March decided to close its restaurants in the country, including the Pushkin Square location in central Moscow that had been a symbol of flourishing American capitalism in the dying embers of the Soviet Union. The departure of McDonald’s is one of the most high-profile so far in opposition to what Russia calls its special operation in neighboring Ukraine.” McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, a move largely seen as a signal just one year before the Soviet Union collapsed. But in March, the company announced that, because of the invasion of Ukraine and the “humanitarian crisis” it caused, its outlets there would close. “This is a complicated issue that’s without precedent and with profound consequences,” said McDonald’s chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, in a statement to staff, reported by the BBC. The departure comes at a high cost, and the company will write off a $1.4bn charge while also covering pay for the 62,000 employees now out of work, until the newly branded restaurants reopen. “Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens is surely the right thing to do,” Kempczinski said. “But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. And it is impossible to imagine the Golden Arches representing the same hope and promise that led us to enter the Russian market 32 years ago.” The mayor of Kharkiv has announced that the city will resume subway service this week after the underground system was used for months to shelter civilians, CNN reports. “All lines will be launched,” the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said in a televised address, noting that the trains won’t go as often as they did before the invasion. “The subway depot was damaged during the bombing and shelling, so the intervals will be longer.” Residents in the county’s second-largest city fled to the tracks as Russia attacked in February, but officials said those who sought refuge have now been relocated. Still, if needed, Terekhov said, “people can use the subway as a bomb shelter, especially subway underpasses”. The award-winning Ukrainian film-maker Sergei Loznitsa said he plans to make a documentary about the war in his country. Loznitsa, who lives in Lithuania, is currently showing his latest film, The Natural History of Destruction, at the Cannes film festival. The filmmaker told Reuters today: I haven’t yet been back in Ukraine since the war started but of course I intend to go there, and I intend to make a film, about those atrocities that are taking place at the moment. Loznitsa also defended his position that Russian film-makers should not be boycotted in response to the war in Ukraine: Culture in general, by definition, opposes war – it is something that is absolutely against any war. And I’m now handing over the blog to my Guardian US colleague Gabrielle Canon. She will have more updates coming up, so stay tuned. A Ukrainian court has demanded the arrest in absentia of the country’s former president Viktor Yanukovych on charges of treason. The accusations center on a 2010 pact signed by Yanukovych that extended Russia’s lease on naval facilities in Crimea. That agreement, widely known in Ukraine as the Kharkiv pact, allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, Reuters reports. Yanukovych has already received a 13-year jail sentence in absentia for treason, in connection to a letter he sent to Vladimir Putin in 2014. The letter asked the Russian leader to use his country’s army and police forces to restore order in Ukraine. Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014 following mass protests. The foreign minister of Lithuania, Gabrielius Landsbergis, praised the joint declaration signed by his country and Britain today to reaffirm their support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. “A great meeting with a true friend Liz Truss,” Landsbergis said of his discussion with the British foreign secretary. “Full agreement on the need to help Ukraine to achieve a complete victory. Covered the food crisis caused by Russian blockade of Odessa and the need to boost the security of Nato’s eastern flank, [including] forward defence in the Baltics.” In a statement released earlier today, Truss said of the declaration: The UK and Lithuania are two countries which believe in freedom and sovereignty, and who stand up to authoritarian regimes in Europe and across the world. We stand together with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal, barbaric war. The Guardian’s Larry Elliott and Graeme Wearden in Davos report: The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the war in Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy and could result in recession for more vulnerable countries. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. Asked in a session on the world economy at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether the IMF was forecasting a global recession, Georgieva replied: “Not at this point. It doesn’t mean one is out of the question.” The IMF managing director said her organisation had recently downgraded the growth prospects for 143 of its member states, which represent 80% of global output. “Since then the horizon has darkened,” she said, pointing out that the impact of the war in Ukraine was being amplified by a tightening of financial conditions, a rising US dollar and a slowdown in China. “2022 is going to be a tough year.” Read the Guardian’s full report: Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business in the country for the Seattle-based coffee company. Starbucks currently has 130 stores in Russia, according to Reuters, and the company employs nearly 2,000 people in the country. Despite exiting the market, Starbucks said it would continue to support its Russian employees by paying them for six months. The move comes amid a wave of announcements from western companies that they are leaving the Russian market by selling off assets or transferring them to local managers in response to the war in Ukraine. McDonald’s said last week that it would sell its restaurants in Russia to its local licensee and have them rebranded under a new name, but the company will retain its trademarks. The former US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, has applauded Boris Bondarev over his decision to resign as a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva. “Bravo Boris Bondarev! I know that many other Russian officials share your views. Hope they will now have the courage to follow your lead,” McFaul said on Twitter. Bondarev, a 20-year veteran of the Russian foreign ministry, said he was “ashamed” of his country after witnessing the atrocities carried out in Ukraine over the past few months. “Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,” Bondarev said in a public statement. “It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers are due to face war crimes trials, she said, adding that Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said 20 countries announced new security assistance packages for Ukraine during a meeting with allies aimed at coordinating arms for Kyiv. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Ukrainian forces will continue to fight even if they are surrounded by Russian forces in the Donbas region, western officials said. They said while Russians would eventually succeed in encircling the “Severodonetsk pocket”, that did not necessarily spell defeat for the Ukrainians, adding: “The Ukrainians don’t want to give up any territory. They want to make the Russians fight for every bit of it.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Joan Greve. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Lithuania will withdraw its ambassador to Russia from 1 June, according to a presidential decree. No replacement has been named, Reuters reports. On 4 April the Lithuanian foreign ministry said it was expelling the Russian ambassador after Ukraine accused Russian forces of killing civilians in the town of Bucha. Russia’s ambassador to Lithuania “will have to leave the country”, the Lithuanian foreign ministry said in a statement at the time. It said it intended to lower the level of diplomatic representation between the two countries. Ukrainian forces will continue to fight even if they are surrounded by Russian forces in the Donbas region, western officials said. Russian troops have focused their efforts on cutting off the Ukrainians who have been dug in around the strategically important city of Severodonetsk. Western officials said that while Russians would eventually succeed in encircling the “Severodonetsk pocket”, that did not necessarily spell defeat for the Ukrainians. One official said that even if no more aid was able to get through, the Ukrainians had shown they were willing to carry on fighting, inflicting further damage on the Russian military machine. They said: I think this largely comes down to political will. The Ukrainians don’t want to give up any territory. They want to make the Russians fight for very bit of it. By continuing to fight, these Ukrainian troops would fulfil an important military function by “degrading the Russian capability to advance and creating time for the Ukrainian forces to continue to improve their defences elsewhere”, the official said. They added: From a loss of life position escaping might be desirable. but from a military point of view and a political point of view the Ukrainians will intend to fight. We would expect them to fight for every bit of territory they can. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages for Ukraine during a meeting with allies aimed at coordinating arms for Kyiv, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said. Among the countries that announced new packages were Italy, Denmark, Greece, Norway and Poland, Austin said at a news conference at the conclusion of the virtual meeting. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Denmark agreed to provide a harpoon launcher and missiles to “help Ukraine defend its coast”, he said. The Czech Republic agreed to send “substantial support” to Kyiv including “a recent donation of attack helicopters, tanks and rocket systems,” he added. Other countries came forward “with new commitments for training Ukraine’s forces and sustaining its military systems”, he said. Austin said: Everyone here understands the stakes of this war. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Venediktova said 48 more Russian soldiers would face war crimes trials, after a Kyiv court sentenced Vadim Shishimarin to life in prison for the killing of a 62-year-old unarmed civilian, Oleksandr Shelipov. Venediktova said: We have already initiated close to 13,000 cases which are connected only to war crimes. In this category, suspicions were reported [about] 49 individuals, which we started to prosecute [for] war crimes. Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes, she said, while two cases involving three individuals were already being held by courts. Venediktova said the scale of complaints against Russia suggested a systemic tolerance or encouragement of war crimes against Ukrainians, adding: All evidence indicates that the Russian military and political elite has unconditionally reverted to the brutal war tactics of violence. Civilian populations and civilian objects – including hospitals, educational facilities, and residential buildings – are internationally targeted in a widespread and systematic manner. She said violations by Russian forces that her team had documented amounted to “unspeakable deliberate cruelty and violence against civilians”, adding: This is particularly apparent in territories that were on the frontlines of war, which practically became a slaughterhouse. She said 4,600 civilians were known to have died as a result of the war, including 232 children, and the real number was likely to be higher. The US is considering sending special operations forces to Ukraine to guard its embassy in Kyiv, according to US officials. The Biden administration is in the early stages of discussions about sending forces into the Ukrainian capital and a proposal has not been presented to the president for a decision, CNN reports. The Wall Street Journal first reported that US military and diplomatic officials were weighing up plans to send troops to Kyiv to guard the newly reopened embassy there. Currently, the embassy and its limited number of personnel are being protected by US state department diplomatic security officials. US marines typically guard embassies but there has been a general agreement that they may not be suited to the uncertain security situation in Ukraine, officials told CNN. The US does not believe Russia would overtly attack its embassy but there is concern that it could inadvertently target the compound and the situation could dramatically escalate, officials said. A Russian diplomat who resigned over the war in Ukraine said he does not believe his feelings are shared by many of his former colleagues in the foreign ministry. Boris Bondarev, Russia’s counsellor to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a statement that he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and criticised the Russian foreign ministry for its increasing “level of lies and unprofessionalism”. The statement was published by the UN rights watchdog, UN Watch. Bondarev later explained to the BBC why he had chosen to defect: The reason is that I strongly disagree and disapprove of what my government is doing and has been doing at least since February, and I don’t want to be associated with that any longer. He said it was a case of when, not if, he was going to quit. “I don’t see any alternative.” He said he did not believe that his feelings were widespread in the foreign ministry, but he hoped his decision to leave “may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built”, adding: I think most people, the majority of them, are following the propaganda and what their superiors tell them. When you work in the ministry you work in a hierarchy, so you must obey what your superior tells you. And for many years any critical approach has been erased from the ministry mostly. Asked if he believed he would be considered a traitor, he replied: I think they are already considering me as such. Bondarev also spoke to Reuters about his decision to leave the post, saying he had started to think about leaving “a few years ago but the scale of this disaster drove me to do it”. He said: I went to the mission like any other Monday morning and I forwarded my resignation letter and I walked out. He said had raised his concerns about the Russian invasion of Ukraine with senior embassy staff several times, and was “told to keep my mouth shut in order to avoid ramifications”. It is 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world.

Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he had not meant to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, criticised those who conceived of the war for “enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity”. He later confirmed he has left his post. The Belarusian president and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, said he was concerned about what he called moves by the west to “dismember” Ukraine. During a televised meeting with the Russian president, Lukashenko also accused Poland of seeking to seize the western part of Ukraine. He provided no evidence to support either of his claims. Britain and Lithuania have signed a joint declaration that will look to build on bilateral defence and trade ties, the UK Foreign Office said. The declaration will build on the defence cooperation the two countries share as Nato allies and will increase resistance to threats, including from Russia and China, the UK government said. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Belarusian president and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, said he was concerned about what he called moves by the West to “dismember” Ukraine. During a televised meeting with Putin, Lukashenko also accused Poland of seeking to seize the Western part of Ukraine. He provided no evidence to support either of his claims. Lukashenko said: What worries us is that they are ready, the Poles and Nato, to come out, to help take western Ukraine like it was before 1939. Russia has previously suggested that Poland wants to establish control over historical Polish lands in Ukraine, a claim that Warsaw denies as disinformation, Reuters reports. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow was looking at an Italian peace plan proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies and reported by AFP, Rudenko said: We have received it recently and are studying it. He said discussions had not taken place between Russia and Italy, adding that Russia would comment at a later stage. Britain and Lithuania have signed a joint declaration that will look to build on bilateral defence and trade ties, the UK Foreign Office said. In a statement, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: The UK and Lithuania are two countries which believe in freedom and sovereignty, and who stand up to authoritarian regimes in Europe and across the world. We stand together with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal, barbaric war. Lithuania shares a border with Belarus, whose president, Alexander Lukashenko, has forged a close relationship with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The declaration will build on the defence cooperation the two countries share as Nato allies and will increase resistance to threats, including from Russia and China, the British government said. Germany is to relax visa requirements for skilled workers from Russia, just as the country’s domestic intelligence agency warned of a heightened risk that Russian nationals working for German firms could be recruited for industrial espionage. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is streamlining the visa application process by exempting Russian workers with specialised expertise in areas such as IT and communication technology from case-by-case assessments through the federal employment department. The so-called “global approval for access to the labour market”, which applies only to Russian employees of German companies who are earning at least €43,992 a year, will last until 30 September. Between the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of May, Germany issued more than 600 visas for Russian skilled workers, which allow for a longer stay in Germany than the 90-day so-called Schengen visa. The German foreign office told the news agency dpa it had issued about 350 work visas via its Moscow embassy in April, in addition to a further 190 working visas issued by the general consulate in St Petersburg. Most of those in receipt of such visas were already working for German firms, dpa said. Germany is already home to about 235,000 Russian passport holders, more than any other country in the European Union. Only last week, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution issued a special warning that Russian nationals who were about to move to Germany, and those already working in the country, faced an increased risk of being blackmailed or otherwise put under pressure to collect information of use to a Russian economy increasingly cut off from global knowledge networks. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, the Ukrainian president has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia, including a full oil embargo, exclusion of its banks from global systems, an ‘abandonment’ of its IT sector, and a complete cessation of trade. Here is a clip from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s presentation: Ukrainians have been out in some cities enthusiastically buying commemorative stamps again. Here are some of the latest pictures from Lviv that we have been sent over the newswires. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, has confirmed to Reuters that he has left his post on account of the war on Ukraine. [see 12.58] He has told the news agency: I went to the mission like any other Monday morning and I forwarded my resignation letter and I walked out. I started to imagine this a few years ago but the scale of this disaster drove me to do it. He told Reuters that he had raised his concerns about the invasion of Ukraine with senior embassy staff several times. “I was told to keep my mouth shut in order to avoid ramifications,” he said. There has been no official comment yet from Russia on Bondarev’s departure. Belarus’s army has begun checking its weaponry and logistics equipment to make sure they are combat-ready, its ministry of defence said, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said the army was carrying out checks on equipment in long-term storage. “The inspection will determine the condition of the equipment and its readiness to carry out its tasks,” it said. Russian troops were stationed in Belarus, which is to the north of Ukraine, for military exercises prior to using it as a launchpad for incursions towards Kyiv at the beginning of the 2022 invasion. Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia will call for the confiscation of Russian assets frozen by the EU to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine, in a joint letter by the four countries seen by Reuters. The letter, which will be presented to EU finance ministers tomorrow, reads: A substantial part of costs of rebuilding Ukraine, including compensation for victims of the Russian military aggression, must be covered by Russia. It also calls for the EU to start preparing new sanctions against Russia, adding: Ultimately, if Russia does not stop the military aggression against Ukraine, there should be no economic ties remaining between EU and Russia at all – ensuring that none of our financial resources, products or services contributes to Russia’s war machine. The four countries call for legal ways to be identified to “maximise” the use of assets frozen by the EU to cover “the costs of Ukraine’s continued efforts to withstand the Russian aggression, and for the post-war reconstruction of the country”. Last week, the European Commission said it would check if it was possible to seize frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine under national and EU laws. EU officials have warned that the confiscation of assets could be legally difficult. The letter continues: In cases where legal ways to confiscate the assets will not be identified, it should be used as leverage and released only once Russia compensates Ukraine for all the damages done. Lithuania has called for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London. “Time is very, very short. We are closing in on a new harvest and there is no other practical way of exporting the grain except through the Black Sea port of Odesa,” he told the Guardian. There is no way of storing this grain and no other adequate alternative route. It is imperative that we show vulnerable countries we are prepared to take the steps that are needed to feed the world. Landsbergis proposed that a naval escort operation – not run by Nato – could protect the grain ships as they headed through the Black Sea and past Russian warships. He suggested that, apart from Britain, countries that were affected by the potential loss of grain such as Egypt could provide the necessary protection. What we have seen now is just the beginning. The worst is yet to come in the next five to seven weeks when the first harvest arrives and there is no place to put it, so that means people in northern Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia will be paying exorbitant prices for wheat, corn and the other commodities they need to put food on their table. He said Ukraine needed to export 80m tonnes of wheat alone this year and the only option was through Odesa, the last Black Sea port held by Ukraine. His plan, under gestation for weeks, would require de-mining parts of the Black Sea to ensure safe passage, as well as the agreement of Turkey, which guards the entrance to the Black Sea. “This would be a non-military humanitarian mission and is not comparable with a no-fly zone,” he said. In this endeavour military ships or planes or both would be used to ensure that the grain supplies can leave Odesa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference. We would need a coalition of the willing – countries with significant naval power to protect the shipping lanes, and countries that are affected by this. Nato as an alliance should not take a role, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned of “a hurricane of hunger” if Ukrainian grain is not exported. The world’s 41 least-developed nations import a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Soaring food prices have already driven inflation levels in Egypt to the highest level since mid-2019. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian air strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The attack, which took place last Tuesday, left 87 people dead, Zelenskiy said during his address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Zelenskiy said: Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna under the rubble there were 87 casualties. 87 corpses. It has not been able to independently verify this figure. Last week, Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike. Zelenskiy’s figure would make the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far, Reuters reports. On the day of the attack, a Russian military spokesperson said high-precision, long-range missiles had hit Ukrainian reserves forces at a training centre near Desna and at one other site. A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine, according to reports. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, criticised the Russian foreign ministry – where he has worked for 20 years – for its increasing “level of lies and unprofessionalism”, the rights watchdog UN Watch reports. In a statement shared by the organisation’s director, Hillel Neuer, Bondarev said: For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this year. The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing our all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country. Those who conceived this war want only one thing – to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity. To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this. He said the work of the foreign ministry had become “simply catastrophic” in recent years, adding: Instead of unbiased information, impartial analysis and sober forecasting, there are propaganda cliches in the spirit of Soviet newspapers of the 1930s. A system has been built that deceives itself. He was particularly critical of the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, who he said had gone from a “professional and educated intellectual” to becoming “a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world... with nuclear weapons”. Bondarev added: Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy. It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy. He concluded by saying that he could no longer continue working for the foreign ministry and “shared in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy”. Neuer said Bondarev was a “hero”, adding: We are now calling on all other Russian diplomats at the United Nations—and worldwide—to follow his moral example and resign. US president Joe Biden said Russia must “pay a long-term price” for its “barbarism” in Ukraine in terms of sanctions imposed by the US and its allies. Biden was speaking to reporters earlier today during a visit to Tokyo, where he met with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The pair agreed to monitor Chinese naval activity and joint Chinese-Russia exercises. Asked if Washington was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, he replied: “Yes.” He added: “That’s the commitment we made.” Biden added: We agreed with the One China policy, we signed on to it … but the idea that it can be taken by force is just not appropriate, it would dislocate the entire region and would be another action similar to Ukraine. He directly linked the fates of Ukraine and Taiwan, saying western sanctions on Russia must exact a “long-term price” because otherwise: What signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting to take Taiwan by force? More than 6.5m people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, the UN refugee agency said. A total of 6,538,998 refugees have left Ukraine, with the majority of them entering Poland. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge, Serhii Ahafonov, at a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small room. The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he had not meant to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. Shishimarin, wearing a grey-and-blue hoodie, listened with his head bowed to the judge deliver his long verdict from inside the glass box for defendants. He was given a translation of the judge’s words from Ukrainian to Russian by a court-appointed translator. It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases related to war crimes that could come to trial soon, and Ukrainian authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes across the country. Trying cases so quickly, while the conflict is still ongoing, is extremely unusual and may violate elements of the Geneva conventions, legal experts say. However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was in a car with other Russian soldiers, one of whom ordered him to shoot Shelipov, as he had been a witness to them shooting at a car and then stealing it. Read Shaun Walker’s full report here. Here’s a bit more detail from the Kremlin’s briefing earlier today. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, blamed the west for triggering a global food crisis by imposing the most severe sanctions in modern history on Russia over the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Peskov told reporters: Russia has always been a rather reliable grain exporter. We are not the source of the problem. The source of the problem that leads to world hunger are those who imposed sanctions against us, and the sanctions themselves. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn, barley, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, while Russia and Belarus account for more than 40% of global exports of the crop nutrient potash. Thirty-six countries count on Russia and Ukraine for more than half their wheat imports, according to the United Nations, including some of the world’s poorest nations such as Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he was in intense contact with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the US and the EU in an effort to restore grain exports from Ukraine. Shaun Walker is at the Kyiv court where 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin has been sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial since Russia’s invasion. A Russian soldier has been found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial held in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, pleaded guilty to killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. The judge, Serhiy Agafonov, said Shishimarin, carrying out a “criminal order” by a soldier of higher rank, had fired several shots at the victim’s head from an automatic weapon. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag. You can reach me on Twitter or via email. A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia’s 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing the 62-year-old man in the north-eastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February after being ordered to shoot at him from a car. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko has said that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”. Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last night that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Donetsk’s self-proclaimed separatist leader Denis Pushilin has said that “the prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia was concerned by the trial of Shishimarin in Kyiv, adding that it could not defend his interests in person. Peskov also warned that Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He proposed a full oil embargo and cutting off all of Russia’s banks from the international monetary system. Zelenskiy suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. The World Health Organization mission in Ukraine has said it has “verified 30 additional attacks on healthcare” in the country. It says: “As of 23 May, 248 attacks on health care have been verified in Ukraine. These attacks caused 75 deaths and 59 injuries.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Saying that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in February 2022 if it had been dealt a more severe economic blow after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Zelenskiy proposed: A full oil embargo. That all Russian banks be barred from global systems with no exemptions. Cutting ties with Russia’s IT industry. No trade with Russia. Any company that leaves Russia is welcome to move to the Ukraine market, says Zelenskiy, saying companies would benefit by truly supporting freedom. On the massive challenge of rebuilding Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: We offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour. I invite you to take part in this rebuilding. He suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Zelenskiy quoted George Marshall, who gave his name to the post-second world war rebuilding plan for Europe, who said he didn’t oppose any country, but opposed “hunger, poverty, despair, chaos”. Graeme Wearden is in Davos covering Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the World Economic Forum: WEF founder Klaus Schwab introduces Zelenskiy, saying we have all seen his courageous leadership, and want to hear what lies ahead for Ukraine, and how we can assist. Zelenskiy begins by saying it is a great honour to take part in this year’s Davos – whose theme is history at a turning point. This year, the phrase word ‘turning point’ is more than rhetoric – this is the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world, says Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy says Ukraine has fought longer than expected, but says it wouldn’t have needed to have endured the war, with so many casualties, if tough sanctions had been imposed last autumn. If there had been full unity back in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, would they have launched February’s invasion? Again, Zelenskiy thinks not. Follow it live here: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses WEF – business live Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has been giving his usual daily brief to reporters, which Reuters are carrying some lines from. Peskov has said: Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. The west had triggered a global food crisis by imposing the severest sanctions in modern history on Russia over the war in Ukraine. “Russia has always been a rather reliable grain exporter,” Peskov said. “We are not the source of the problem.” Russia was concerned by the trial of a Russian serviceman in Kyiv charged with war crimes, adding that it could not defend his interests in person. Peskov again said that pumping weapons into Ukraine would not boost security or stability in Europe. Here is that quote from Donetsk’s separatist leader Denis Pushilin about the fate of Ukrainian soldiers who were under siege in Azovstal. Interfax quote him saying: The prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned. A Just Giving page has been has been set up by a Guardian reporter to raise funds for the safe evacuation to Switzerland of an eight-year- old boy who was left as the only child in his ruined village in north east Ukraine. He lived for 87 days below ground. The cause is urgent with Tymofiy and his family in need of help getting to Zurich – and even then their future is full of uncertainty. Here is the page. Tymofiy Seidov and his mother, aunt, grandmother and grandfather spent three months in a dark crowded 40x5-metre basement below the ruins of a kindergarten. Tymofiy spent much of his time drawing monsters and tanks, and also some remembered sunny days, while at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light. When offered the chance to escape, he had begged to stay as he was terrified of the Russian shells that have rained down on his village since 24 February. His mum persuaded him that they needed to leave on Sunday 22 May. Here is the latest story on the evacuation. The family are now in western Ukraine but need help moving on. A reminder that Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will shortly be addressing the World Economic Forum from Davos. My colleague Graeme Wearden is there, and will be covering it live on our business blog. I’ll bring you the key lines here as well. There is a little bit more from Interfax, reporting the words of Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko, saying that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”. He is also quoted as saying that Russia is not ruling out the possibility of a prisoner exchange involving those Ukrainian fighters who surrendered from the Azovstal plant. There is a quick snap going across the newswires via the Interfax news agency, which states that the leader of the pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk has said that all prisoners of war from the Azovstal steel plant will be tried by a tribunal in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. More to follow … Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s Luhansk governor, has given an update on the situation in Severodonetsk. He has posted to Telegram: The Russians damaged five high-rises and shopping areas of the central market. An elderly man was wounded. On 22 May, 11 enemy attacks were repelled, 6 tanks, 10 units of armoured combat vehicles and 6 units of motor vehicles were destroyed. Air defence units shot down 1 UAV Orlan-10 and an enemy Su-25 “Frogfoot”. The claims have not been independently verified. Daniel Boffey writes for us from Irpin in Ukraine about a couple who fled the city with 19 dogs: The image of a windswept young woman holding tight to the leads of nine dogs under an ominously dark sky spread far and wide at the time of the Battle of Kyiv. The apparent bravery of the woman, who was attempting an audacious evacuation across a broken bridge targeted by Russian fire, and the vulnerability of the animals, some of whom were strapped into dog wheelchairs, epitomised to many the cruelty of the war being waged by Vladimir Putin and the dignity of the Ukrainian response. The full story of the trials of Anastasiya Tykha, 20, a veterinary student in the final year of her degree, and her husband Arthur Lee, 26, is perhaps even more striking than the photograph, which the couple discovered had gone viral when Tykha saw herself on the television news and listened to the presenter report that she was dead. Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report here: ‘We had too much to do to be scared’ – the couple who fled Irpin with 19 dogs The World Health Organization mission in Ukraine has tweeted to say that it has “verified 30 additional attacks on healthcare” in the country. It says: As of 23 May, 248 attacks on health care have been verified in Ukraine. These attacks took place between 24 February and 19 May &amp; caused 75 deaths and 59 injuries. Health care should never be a target. A statue of Peter the Great in Deptford, south London, that Vladimir Putin’s government gifted to the UK has been damaged in an attempted robbery, leaving a diplomatically awkward repair bill of thousands of pounds. Millennium Quay, the owners of the Thames-side housing estatethat surrounds the statue, suggested the Russian embassy could pick up the tab. The embassy has not responded to requests for comment. The Deptford statue by Mihail Chemiakin, one of Putin’s favourite artists, commemorates the young tsar’s 1698 trip to Deptford to study English shipbuilding. Joel Coleman, Millennium Quay’s property manager, said: “We can get it restored if we can find out who owns it. In the last resort I’ll call the Russians. As it was a gift from the Russian people, we can see if the Russian embassy will pay for it.” Read more here: Peter the Great statue, Vladimir Putin’s gift to Londoners, damaged in attempted robbery Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted to Telegram to say that there will be a free evacuation train again at 4.30pm local time today to take people from Pokrovsk in Donetsk in the east of the country, out to Lviv in the west via Dnipro. On Sky News in the UK, the former chief of the general staff of the British army, Gen Lord Richard Dannatt, has said that Vladimir Putin has not achieved very much so far in this war. While, he said, “Mariupol was always going to fall at some point”, he added: The significance from the Ukrainian’s point of view was just how long the fighters within the steelworks managed to hold out and hold on, because that dragged in such large numbers of Russian troops who otherwise might have been deployed elsewhere. [Putin] feels obviously very strongly he’s got to achieve something. And that something is, in his view, the complete control of the Donbas region. Elsewhere they’ve done really poorly. I think the Russians, according to reports, are making some small gains but frankly, small gains isn’t going to win this campaign for them. The Ukrainians are still retaining the very well-prepared defensive positions that they’ve occupied for the last six, seven, eight years. With Ukrainian standing on the defence, it’s the Russians who have to throw their combat power against well-prepared Ukrainian positions. And that largely explains why the Russians are taking so many casualties. On the blockade of Odesa, he said: This is one of those major issues that doesn’t just affect the Ukrainian people. It affects all of us worldwide. From a military point of view it is a very interesting one to watch. Ukrainians will be desperate to hold on to Odesa, but they can’t use it as a port at the present moment. For defensive reasons they’ve heavily mined it. They are determined to prevent the Russians capturing Odessa and pushing up through to Transnistria in Moldova. Maksym Kozytskyi, Ukraine’s governor of Lviv, has given his daily update on the situation there. He reports that more people returned to Ukraine than fled over the border in the last 24 hours, with 32,000 leaving and 44,000 coming back. He reported there were two air alerts overnight, one for a suspected missile strike from the Black Sea, and another because “there was a danger from the territory of Belarus”. Whoever is running the Russian foreign ministry social media accounts this morning has gone on a bit of a retweeting spree, distributing some inflammatory claims about the situation in Ukraine from Russian diplomats over the last twelve hours. One message is from Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, who says in a response to a message from Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba thanking Polish people for their help: The Polish dream to have Ukrainian neighbours as cheap labor and control and exploit their land as they did in 1918-1939 has come closer. They have also promoted a video clip from another diplomat, Alexander Alimov, which purports to show what he claims is the “Nazi Aidar battalion” mistreating civilians in the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk. The ministry has also shared a message from a third diplomat, Mikhail Ulyanov, challenging US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s statement about potential food shortages caused by the blockading of the export of Ukraine’s grain. Ulyanov says: Russia expects a record-breaking harvest of wheat in 2022. We stand ready to offer to export 25m tons of grain … what the US is going to offer? My colleague Graeme Wearden has launched our business blog for the day, which is coming from Davos. Ukraine will be high on the agenda, with a special address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy scheduled for 11.15am local time (10.15am BST), and a discussion with Vitaliy and Wladimir Klitschko to follow that. I’ll pick up the key lines on this blog, but Graeme will have the full Davos coverage over here: Davos Day One – Ukrainian MPs call for more support as WEF begins The RIA news agency reports that Russia’s defence ministry says its forces destroyed a Ukrainian unit of US-produced M777 howitzers, a type of artillery weapon. The claim has not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Before I hand you over to my colleague Martin Belam, here are the latest lines from Ukraine this morning: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, its lead negotiator said on Sunday, but the initiative to continue them was with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” he said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west. “After Bucha, Borodianka, Mariupol, there cannot be business as usual with Russia,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high casualty rate, British intelligence added. Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report. Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum in Davos, which kicks off on Monday with a video address from Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed by Ukrainian artists into a “Russian war crimes house”, portraying images of misery and devastation. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. A verdict in the conflict’s first war crimes trial is due today with a panel of judges in Kyiv determining the fate of 21-year-old Russian sergeant Vadim Shishimarin. New Zealand will deploy a further 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes. For a more comprehensive rundown please see our earlier summary. A verdict in the conflict’s first war crimes trial is due today with a panel of judges in Kyiv determining the fate of Russian sergeant Vadim Shishimarin. The shaven-headed 21-year-old from Siberia has admitted to killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in the early stages of the invasion, but earlier told the court he was pressured into an act for which he was “truly sorry”. “I was nervous about what was going on. I didn’t want to kill,” he said from the glass defence box, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, as the trial concluded on Friday. Shysimarin added: “I’m truly and sincerely sorry. I didn’t want that to happen, I didn’t want to be there, but it happened. I would like to apologise once again. And I will accept all the measures of punishment that I will be offered.” Shishimarin’s lawyer has argued for an acquittal, saying his client was carrying out what he perceived to be a direct order that he initially disobeyed. Prosecutors, who have asked for a life sentence, said he was “well aware” he was executing a “criminal order”. New Zealand will deploy another 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday the soldiers would be training their Ukrainian counterparts in operating a L119 105mm light field gun. The deployment was another way New Zealand could support Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, Ardern said. We have been clear throughout Russia’s assault on Ukraine, that such a blatant attack on innocent lives and the sovereignty of another country is wrong, and our response has not only included the condemnation of Russia, but practical support for Ukraine.” The prime minister said the troops will be in the UK until the end of July and train 230 Ukrainians. This new support comes in addition to the extensive assistance we have already provided to Ukraine, which encompasses the military, humanitarian, legal, and other aspects of the conflict. There are very few armed forces that could provide this training right now, which is why New Zealand has been specifically called upon.” The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes. “The 30 NZDF personnel will in no way enter the Ukraine for this training,” Ardern added. British prime minister Boris Johnson has penned an emotive letter to the children of Ukraine, commending them for holding their heads high in the “toughest of times” and reassuring them they are not alone, according to a report from PA Media. The prime minister said he was “very sad” to see youngsters absent from the streets and parks of Kyiv when he visited the Ukrainian capital last month, adding: “I cannot imagine how difficult this year must have been for you.” When your president showed me around Kyiv last month, the absence of children and young people on the streets and in the parks made me feel very sad. Since the invasion many of you have been forced to flee your homes. You have left behind family, friends, pets, toys and all that is familiar, seeking refuge in underground stations, distant cities, even other countries. I cannot imagine how difficult this year must have been for you. Many of you have seen or experienced things no child should have to witness. Yet, every day Ukrainian children are teaching all of us what it means to be strong and dignified, to hold your head high in even the toughest of times. I can think of no better role model for children and adults everywhere.” Earlier, Johnson resolved to “redouble efforts” to provide vital food and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and ensure the country is able to export to the rest of the world. In a call to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, Johnson said that Britons are “1000%” behind the people of Ukraine. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has likely suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the UK ministry of defence has claimed. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach which is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released this morning. Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.” Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said. Russian forces are also preparing to resume an offensive in the Slovyansk direction after its troops were repelled following a failed operation in the area of Dovhenke, Ukraine’s latest operational report reads. In the Kharkiv region, Russian forces have set up checkpoints and fortifications on access roads near the settlements of Velykyi Burluk, Kapitolivka, Mykhailivka, Levkivka, Zabavne and Kupyansk, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said. Meanwhile, in the Donetsk direction, Russian forces are reportedly attempting to break through the defences of Ukrainian troops and reach the administrative borders of Luhansk oblast. Russia is focusing its main efforts on “maintaining occupied frontiers, conducting reconnaissance and engineering activities of positions”, Ukraine’s military claims adding its forced thwarted 11 Russian attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk over the past 24 hours. The conflict in Ukraine is making its mark at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Kyiv will continues its diplomatic counteroffensive by targeting the world’s business and political elite gathering in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos during a four-day meeting of global business leaders. Talks will begin on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This is the world’s most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say,” the Ukrainian president said in an earlier address. Zelenskiy will also mark the opening of Ukraine House Davos, a forum for Kyiv and its international backers. “Ukraine House Davos will host dialogue on security, sanctions, humanitarian aid, rebuilding and revitalising Ukraine, and more,” an official statement reads. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg are among the leaders due to address the meeting. In March, Davos organisers cut ties with Russian firms and officials, and announced that anyone under international sanctions would not be welcome at the event. The main street in the town in Switzerland has been turned into a Russian War Crimes House by Ukrainian artists hoping to get their message across to world leaders, Reuters reports. Visitors are confronted by images such as a badly burned man in Kharkiv after Russian shelling and a film made up of thousands of pictures of dead civilians and bombed houses. “The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos this year will be the most timely and consequential annual meeting since the creation of the forum over 50 years ago,’’ WEF founder Klaus Schwab told reporters ahead of the meeting. “The return of war, epidemics and the climate crisis, all those disruptive forces have derailed the global recovery,” Schwab said. “Those issues must be confronted in Davos; the global food crisis, in particular, needs our immediate attention.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said 50 to 100 Ukrainians are dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region and that Sievierodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions” though Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city. Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. A British intelligence report released on Sunday claimed the city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while before my colleagues in London take the reins a little later in the day. On today’s agenda, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will continue his diplomatic counteroffensive by targeting the world’s business and political elite gathering in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos. Zelenskiy will kick off the four-day World Economic Forum of global business leaders with a video address. Zelenskiy has also claimed that up to 100 Ukrainians are dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.

This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed by Ukrainian artists into a “Russian war crimes house”, portraying images of misery and devastation. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been wounded in an explosion. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years”, France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying,” Clément Beaune said. “It’s probably in 15 or 20 years. It takes a long time.” Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since, “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from president Vladimir Putin’s military. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.

The French energy firm’s board approved plans on Tuesday to close the 39-year old Fessenheim plant in north-east France, near the German border, allaying fears that the company, which is 85%-state owned, would drag its heels until President François Hollande left office later this year. Hollande had promised in his manifesto to shut the site in an effort to build an alliance with the Green party. Fessenheim has also been the subject of complaints about safety from the German and Swiss governments. Under Hollande, France has pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear from 78% of electricity generation to 50% by 2025 and increase its use of renewables, such as wind and solar. The country’s nuclear plants are ageing, with many expected to come to the end of their life in the 2030s. France’s energy transition law caps the amount of nuclear power at 63.2 gigawatts, meaning the Fessenheim plant needs to close in 2018 to pave the way for a new one at Flamanville. Under the deal agreed by EDF, the company will be paid €490m (£420m) in compensation for dismantling the plant and retraining its 850 workers. “With this decision on the part of its board of directors, EDF is guaranteeing compliance with legislation imposing a ceiling for France’s installed nuclear electricity generation capacity, while at the same time safeguarding to the utmost the interests of the company and its customers,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, its chief executive. Unions said they were pleased that the plant, which had been slated for closure as early as 2016, would stay open for another year. “For us it’s a good decision. We consider it a victory because the closure has been delayed until 2018,” said Marie-Claire Cailletaud, a spokeswoman for the CGT union, which represents workers. Experts said that if the centre right won power from the Socialist-Green coalition in presidential elections this April, the target of reducing nuclear to 50% of electricity generation could be watered down. “It is politically impossible,” said Marc Fornacciari, a French energy expert and partner at law firm Dentons, of the centre right’s stance. “They will not abide by 50% of nuclear generation as that would lead to the closure of a third of nuclear plants. Nuclear will decrease but not as quickly as [required] by law.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jul/03/boris-johnson-cash-splurge-election-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-03T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s cash splurge is totally reckless.

Dollops of scepticism about his Brexit plans, a few questions about that dodgy past – and a vast yawning incuriosity about any of his other policies. You can see why that is: when one has a star so box office and a show as dramatic as Britain crashing out of Europe within a few months, then who cares about the support acts? Especially if one doubts the Bullingdon buffoon is even capable of having policies. Still, this is an astonishingly easy ride to give a man probably just three weeks away from becoming our next prime minister. It also hugely underestimates the former foreign secretary and the seriousness of the threat he now poses to our way of life. The area that has given me most pause over the past few days is the one that many of my colleagues have greeted with the greatest derision: Johnson’s outlining of his economic plans. I see their absurdity, yet they do not make me laugh. Are they ridiculous? No doubt. Reckless? Of course. But could they help him secure power and forever alter Britain? Sadly, I believe they could. On early showing, Boris-onomics may be rife with intellectual contradictions, but politically it is utterly cogent – and the Tory hard right no longer seeks starred firsts, but state power. What they are putting together is a package both to buy enough of a public mandate for a no-deal Brexit, and then to rip up what remains of Britain’s tattered social contract between workers, employers and the state. More worryingly, I cannot yet see anything like a sufficient response either from the Labour opposition or among the disparate groups that claim to speak for remain. What is the big difference between Johnson’s economics and that practised by his former colleagues in government? In a word, cash – and lots of it. In the 2017 general election, Theresa May famously told a struggling nurse that there was no “magic money tree” to give her a pay rise. Her would-be replacement has found not just one tree, but a whole forest. Pay rises for public-sector workers! Fewer workers paying national insurance! Tax cuts for the rich! And that’s just for starters. As mayor of London, Johnson was mad about infrastructure, never happier than when strapped into a hard hat. He spaffed tens of millions on a garden bridge across the Thames and dreamed of erecting an airport on an estuary island. If he becomes prime minister, he will almost certainly unleash the biggest public-works programme seen this decade. You can imagine him now, performing Churchill to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg and her camera operator on building sites across the country; or driving a crane while reciting Tacitus. High-speed rail and superfast broadband everywhere! Nuclear power stations! Airport runways! Much of this could be announced as soon as an emergency budget in September, since his team say they want the economy “going gangbusters” by 31 October, just as the government bellyflops out of the EU. Ah, you may say. Ah, but those are just more promises from the man who paraded himself in front of a lying bus. True, except every one of the serious contenders for the Tory leadership carried their own huge blank cheque. The last challenger standing, the supposed moderate Jeremy Hunt, has actually pledged greater spending commitments than Johnson. And, little noticed at Westminster, Nigel Farage this week made his first policy pledge for the Brexit party: a £200bn bung for everywhere outside London. This tells you two things. First, that the two figureheads of no-deal politics, Farage and Johnson, are now in an open bidding war to buy up the Labour leave constituencies. Johnson is pitching himself as the Tory who can see off Farage and Jeremy Corbyn: he will keep on promising to spend public millions to keep his party in government. And he may have some success: polling from January this year showed that only 36% of Labour leave voters list Brexit as a top-three issue for them or their families. Far higher rank the economy, austerity and welfare cuts. Second, that four years after Corbyn made Labour an anti-cuts party, Britain is finally entering a post-austerity era. After nearly a decade of teaching assistants resorting to food banks, of council services getting cut to the bone, and of homeless people lining our streets, the contrast will be so sharp as to be painful. When Ramsay MacDonald’s government finally devalued the pound in 1931 and the much-foretold chaos didn’t break out, a Labour stalwart remarked in bewilderment: “Nobody told us we could do that.” And when Britain finally breaks with austerity, there will settle over Whitehall and town halls across the country a similar stunned amazement. But the big lesson from this is that there is no longer a market for the language of “tough choices” and “there’s no money left”. Will this stabilise a country in freefall from a hard Brexit or no deal at all? Of course not. The latest figures from the consultancy EY show that foreign direct investment into Britain is already plunging, a trend that will surely continue after Brexit. Whatever the Conservatives spend on Sunderland will dwindle into insignificance on the day Nissan finally follows Honda and Ford and announces it will halve the size of its plant there. Yet Westminster has spent years ignoring the crisis of capitalism, by bunging money at large corporations and the rich. What you can expect under Johnson is a much bigger and bolder version of this traditional Tory move – which will be hallelujahed by the rightwing press, even as it sharpens inequality between rich and poor and between regions. However malign the motives and however grotesque the result, it will be aimed at buying time for a clapped-out party and their wealth-extracting mates. Compare that with the alternatives, though. The ineffective People’s Vote campaign, with its promise of £4.7bn for “left-behind” (a terrible term) areas. Or Corbyn’s Labour, whose anti-austerity offering will struggle to stand out against a spend-happy Tory government. The opposition may claim that the Conservatives have stolen their policies, but politics isn’t literature: it places little value on originality. The left can’t expect that pointing out Johnson’s racism or his past will sway voters – those tactics didn’t stop him grabbing City Hall. Remainers can’t carry on pointing out the madness of leaving the EU to turn this country into Singapore with jumpers – that didn’t work in 2016. We need to get much more serious and imaginative, show that staying in the EU is the best way to end austerity, and come up with policies to improve living standards here and now. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/12/brazil-nuclear-reactor-armed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T07:15:23Z","webTitle":"Armed raid on nuclear workers' housing raises fears over Brazil's two reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/12/brazil-nuclear-reactor-armed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/12/brazil-nuclear-reactor-armed","fields":{"headline":"Armed raid on nuclear workers' housing raises fears over Brazil's two reactors","bodyText":"Fears over the security of Brazil’s two nuclear power plants have been raised after a heavily armed gang raided a secure workers’ condominium just a kilometre away and blew up two cash machines. About 10 men held security guards hostage at around 3am on Monday, robbed guests at a party in a private club then escaped in a waiting speedboat from the Praia Brava condominium for workers at the Angra 1 and 2 nuclear reactors, run by state company Eletronuclear. It was the second incident in a month: on 9 December, thieves exploded an ATM in the Mambucaba Condominium, another security-controlled workers’ village 15km away from the plants, near Angra dos Reis on the Rio de Janeiro state coastline. Dr Paul Dorfman, a senior researcher at University College London’s Energy Institute, said that the use of “explosives and modern weaponry close to any nuclear plant” was a cause for worry, even if the explosion would not have caused direct damage to reactors. “There are grave and increasing concerns about risk of attack to a nuclear plant across the world,” he said. While reactors are encased in steel pressure vessels and layers of concrete, high-level radioactive spent nuclear fuel ponds are at greater risk. Older reactors like Angra 1, which began operating in 1982, have less sophisticated safety systems than more modern plants. “If someone was to throw a few explosions around you could imagine what would happen,” Dorfman said. Residents of the Praia Brava condominium, which is controlled by a private security firm, were terrified by the attacks. “They were stunned,” said a relative of one family that lives in the condominium, who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals. “Nobody imagined that this could happen.” Local politicians have called for military protection for the area. “It is an unbelievable situation,” said Thimoteo de Sá, a city councillor in Angra dos Reis, the nearest town 44 kilometres away. “This should be protected by the army at least – we are talking about a nuclear plant.” On Friday, Eletronuclear closed cash machine at its four residential areas, the company said in an emailed statement. “The entire security force of the company in Angra was put on notice, and the surveillance of the Angra nuclear power plant was reinforced,” it said. Security at the plants is overseen by the federal government, it said. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico are the only three Latin American countries with functioning nuclear power plants. Brazil is believed to have had a nuclear weapons programme, though it is unclear if it ever actually developed a weapon, and it renounced the ambitions in 1990. Brazil still mines its own uranium and is building a nuclear-powered submarine with French help. Angra 1 and Angra 2 supply 3% of Brazil’s electricity. Work on a third reactor, Angra 3 began in 1984, was suspended two years later, began again in 2010 and ground to a halt again in 2015 after Eletronuclear officials were arrested as part of a sweeping corruption investigation. Eletronuclear said it was looking for partners to finish Angra 3 and has signed memorandums of understanding with Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom and the China National Nuclear Corporation. Lying around 200km west of Rio de Janeiro, the “Green Coast” tourist area around Angra dos Reis has suffered from rising violent crime. In August, British tourist Eloise Dixon was shot and wounded when her family’s hire car drove into a community controlled by Rio drug gang the Red Command. Police said the gang involved in the December ATM robberies targeted Santander bank cash machines because they have less sophisticated security systems. “It is a gang specialised in this type of crime, it operates in other states and it had support from a gang here in Rio,” said Mauricio Mendonça, a detective from the Rio police’s robberies division."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-fracking-the-end-cant-come-soon-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-04T18:23:07Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on fracking: the end can’t come soon enough | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-fracking-the-end-cant-come-soon-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-fracking-the-end-cant-come-soon-enough","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on fracking: the end can’t come soon enough","bodyText":"Less than four months after what was supposed to be a new beginning for fracking in England, when Cuadrilla resumed operations at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, it appears increasingly unlikely that there is a future for this industry in the UK at all. Minor earthquakes rapidly halted fracking at Preston New Road, and led to a row about whether the legal limit for underground seismic activity, set at 0.5-magnitude after earthquakes in 2011, is unrealistically low. Now Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemicals firm Ineos and the UK’s richest man, has launched his own attack both on the 0.5 limit and on the planning system that has seen all three of Ineos’s applications to frack rejected by local authorities – although two were later granted on appeal. The government’s refusal to change the law in the industry’s favour, he said, means that it is “shutting down shale by the backdoor”. Having watched the success of the shale gas industry in the US since 2000, Mr Ratcliffe and politicians including former chancellor George Osborne decided that fracking – which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals 2km underground at high pressure – should become a UK industry too. Senior Conservatives including the current energy minister, Claire Perry, agreed. They were wrong. The UK is unsuited to fracking, for political and geological reasons that have become clearer over the past few years, and all the money (Ineos alone has spent £150m) and effort expended on trying to foist a new and dirty industry on communities who do not want it has been thrown away. Fracking was always a bad idea, because of climate change. Cutting carbon emissions means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. To develop a new gas industry is to do the opposite, and arguments that shale gas is needed to “bridge” a gap in energy supply when existing nuclear power stations are decommissioned, and before they are replaced, are largely spurious. The idea that the UK’s energy security is threatened is similarly unfounded. Unlike eastern European countries that rely on gas from Russia, our imported gas comes mostly from Norway. The government’s most recent assessment concluded that supplies are resilient. Dramatic recent falls in the cost of renewables have greatly strengthened the case against fracking, as well as providing one of the few glimmers of hope in a darkening global climate picture. What happened, as the campaign against fracking gathered strength, is that the politics of energy and climate harmonised with local concerns around environment and democracy. In Lancashire, Derbyshire, West Sussex and South Yorkshire, activists mobilised because they didn’t want the traffic, disruption, minor earthquakes and pollution they feared fracking would bring, and didn’t regard the promised economic boost as sufficient compensation. Local politicians sided with them. A parallel situation played out in Scotland, where Ineos lost a case it brought against the Holyrood government last year. And while it remains possible that the UK government will try to alter the planning system so that fracking is allowed under “permitted development” rights, locking councils out of the process, the opposition of around 20 Conservative MPs makes is unlikely that any such law could pass. Polls have consistently shown that fracking is unpopular. When three anti-fracking activists were freed from jail last year they were greeted with cheers. The public were ahead of the government in realising that giving up on this industry makes sense."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T17:17:28Z","webTitle":"Chinese firm behind Essex nuclear plant refuses to reveal security information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","fields":{"headline":"Chinese firm behind Essex nuclear plant refuses to reveal security information","bodyText":"The Chinese state-owned company planning a nuclear power station in Essex refused to share the security arrangements for a Chinese nuclear plant with the British authorities, it has been revealed. Inspectors from the UK nuclear regulator visited the China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) in Shenzhen earlier this year, as part of the four-year approval process for the reactor the company wants to build at Bradwell. A green light from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) would be a huge boost for China’s aspirations for exporting nuclear technology and Bradwell would be the first Chinese reactor to be built in a developed country. Overall the ONR welcomed the “high level of expertise and commitment” shown by the Chinese, according to a report of the visit on 13-16 March, released to the Guardian under freedom of information rules. However, CGN said it could not share material about security measures to protect its nuclear plant in Fangchenggang, China, which Bradwell could be modelled on. “With regard to the sharing of information, such as the security plans for FCG [Fangchenggang] Unit 3, CGN stated that these were protected documents under Chinese regulations,” the UK authorities wrote, in a glimpse of UK nuclear regulation rubbing up against Chinese state secrecy. But the ONR insisted that it was commonplace for foreign nuclear companies not to share sensitive documents around national security during the UK nuclear approval process, known as the Generic Design Assessment (GDA). It added that it was the arrangements for Bradwell that were relevant, not Fangchenggang. A spokeswoman said: “It is routine for site security plans to be protected, and is not unexpected. It will in no way restrict our assessment of the UK HPR1000[the Chinese reactor design].” During the visit, the regulator told the Chinese that the UK’s formal assessment of the reactor would be a “long journey” and would require China to be forthcoming with a “sufficient description of the design” so nuclear safety claims could be checked. The UK said it could only maintain its staffing levels for the approval process if the Chinese did not delay providing the necessary information. There is no suggestion the UK nuclear regulator would approve the Chinese reactor without receiving the documentation it required. In a statement, the ONR said: “The purpose of the GDA process is to ensure that the design meets the robust safety and security standards required in the UK, and our regulatory focus is on the arrangements and design of the UK HPR1000, planned for Bradwell.” Antony Froggatt, a nuclear expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The ONR clearly highlight to the Chinese partners that there are resource adequacy implications and risks, and I would be more blunt and say their ability to adequately do their job, if not being provided with sufficient material.” GCN said the company was committed to working with the ONR in a transparent way, including sharing all information needed. “This is no difference to the approach taken for any other would-be operator, whether it be American, Japanese, Chinese or British. As you would expect, all nuclear companies around the world protect sensitive information concerning the security of their own national nuclear sites, and regulators understand and support such essential precautions,” said Robert Davies, CGN UK’s chief operating officer. CGN put up a third of £18bn cost towards EDF’s project to build French-designed reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, in return for developing its own plant at Bradwell in Essex. The Bradwell B project is two thirds owned by CGN and one third EDF. The government paused approval for Hinkley for several months last year, because of concerns over China’s stake. CGN is becoming an increasing central player in Britain’s atomic plans, having recently confirmed it is considering buying Toshiba’s troubled NuGen project to build a nuclear power station in Cumbria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2019/feb/01/lets-move-anglesey-ynys-mon-wales-world-apart-tom-dyckhoff","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-01T16:30:07Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Anglesey/Ynys Môn, Wales: ‘A world apart’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/01/lets-move-anglesey-ynys-mon-wales-world-apart-tom-dyckhoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2019/feb/01/lets-move-anglesey-ynys-mon-wales-world-apart-tom-dyckhoff","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Anglesey/Ynys Môn, Wales: ‘A world apart’","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions also continued to fall, dropping 3% in 2017, as coal use fell and the use of renewables climbed. Energy experienced the biggest drop in emissions of any UK sector, of 8%, while pollution from transport and businesses stayed flat. Energy industry chiefs said the figures showed that the government should rethink its ban on onshore wind subsidies, a move that ministers have hinted could happen soon. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the big six lobby group Energy UK, said: “We need to keep up the pace ... by ensuring that the lowest cost renewables are no longer excluded from the market.” Across the whole year, low-carbon sources of power – wind, solar, biomass and nuclear – provided a record 50.4% of electricity, up from 45.7% in 2016. But in the fourth quarter of 2017, high wind speeds, new renewables installations and lower nuclear output saw wind and solar becoming the second biggest source of power for the first time. Wind and solar generated 18.33 terawatt hours (TWh), with nuclear on 16.69TWh, the figures published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show. But renewables still have a long way to go to catch up with gas, the UK’s top source of electricity at 36.12TWh, which saw its share of generation fall slightly. Greenpeace said the figures showed the government should capitalise on its lead in renewables and “stop wasting time and money propping up nuclear power”. Horizon Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in talks with Whitehall officials for a financial support package from the government, which it says it needs by midsummer. By contrast, large-scale solar and onshore wind projects are not eligible for support, after the Conservative government cut subsidies in 2015. However the energy minister, Claire Perry, recently told House Magazine that “we will have another auction that brings forward wind and solar, we just haven’t yet said when”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/jun/26/climate-activism-extinction-rebellion-protest-guilty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-26T14:09:43Z","webTitle":"At 68, my climate activism made me a criminal.

But I refuse to give up","bodyText":"I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public. We put up maps showing how much of East Anglia and London would be under water as temperatures soared and the sea levels rose. This was in the early 1980s. We concentrated on what individuals could do to lower their carbon footprints – by putting up solar panels, changing lightbulbs, practising recycling and re-use, eating less meat, using public transport, shopping carefully and locally, and consuming less. After discovering the impact that UK timber imports were having on the loss of old-growth forests and their biodiversity, I even got involved in carbon sinks and sustainable forest management. I worked with major UK timber importers to persuade them to stop importing timber stolen from indigenous reserves in South America and Asia. But of course individuals changing their personal lifestyles was not enough. Governments had to get involved and make systemic changes. However, very few people and governments listened to us. We were Cassandras, considered doom-mongers, nihilists, mad. But if governments had acted then, we would not be at crisis point now. I cannot really understand why those in power have refused to act. After all, it is their world, too. I know politicians are relentlessly lobbied by the extractive industries, that there is a revolving door from politics and the civil service to the oil and aviation industries. But when our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money. We know what to do to tackle the climate crisis, but it is not being done. Yet to be depressed and to lose all hope only makes the problem worse. I am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet. I believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. Over the past 40 years I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat the climate emergency and prevent catastrophic collapse. That is why I took part in a peaceful road blockade in April with Extinction Rebellion, as a result of which I was convicted this week of a public order offence. I believed our action could persuade our government to implement three demands to help save our world for future generations. First, to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency and to work with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. Second, to act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025. Third, to go beyond politics and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice. Following the wave of actions in London that began on 15 April, I believe that the necessity of our work, and its success in raising the alarm, are now widely acknowledged. Like most people, I do not like being arrested. I did not want to spend three days in police cells refusing what I considered to be unreasonable bail conditions preventing me from returning to the protests. I do not enjoy spending time in courts, nor do I wish to spend scarce resources travelling from Wales to London for the hearings. If the government had done its job of acting in the public interest by providing people with honest information about the scale and urgency of the threat, if it had addressed the threat instead of compounding it, I would not have needed to engage in nonviolent direct action. Even though I did refuse to move when asked to by a policeman, I believed I was justified in remaining at the protest and taking part in what I considered to be a reasonable and proportionate response to the climate emergency. I believed that my action, alongside many of the thousands gathered in London that week, would help avoid disaster and lead to change. And this has been proved to be true. It has opened up a space for real debate about the climate emergency and what practical actions can be taken. Wales became the first country to formally declare a climate emergency. A few days later, the UK government declared a climate and environmental emergency. I have been involved in persuading my own town council in Knighton, Powys, to declare a climate emergency and to hold public meetings to decide what practical actions can be taken. I believe that this would not have happened without the creative disruption we caused in central London. Given that our fragile planet is undergoing a climate crisis that will soon culminate in chaos and massive loss of life, I had to do all in my power to bring about the necessary changes to prevent this catastrophe. I hope you will agree that what I did was a reasonable, proportionate and necessary response to the emergency situation we are in. • This is an edited extract of Angie Zelter’s statement at Hendon magistrates court on 25 June.

They act as though renewable energy, battery storage and electric cars will take us down the path to blackouts, economic ruin and, of course, the end of weekends as we know them. But if recent history has taught us anything it’s that there is nothing consistent about the modern conservatives, most of whom live in fear of the unintended consequences of renewable power but warmly welcome the unexpected possibilities of nuclear power. The same contradictions are obvious in agriculture. While spruiking the virtues of genetic modification (GM) and the safety of glyphosate is standard fare for the modern conservatives, not all agricultural innovations are so warmly welcomed. While organic crops offer farmers significantly higher returns, such farming practices are often dismissed as “virtue signalling” rather than real farming. And when chickenless chicken meat was launched on to the market recently (apparently it tastes a bit like chicken), the National’s deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, responded by tweeting: “Not happy with latest fake food push. Chicken-free chicken is not chicken, it’s reconstituted peas. We need to protect our farmers.” It is not clear whether McKenzie realises that, on the most recent UN data, Australia is the world’s largest exporter of chickpeas, or if she simply doesn’t care. While the modern conservatives’ love of all things coal seems to revolve around support for traditional coalmining jobs and fears around renewable energy’s reliability, if you scratch the surface another rich vein of hypocrisy can be found. Despite the many column inches they dedicate to the obvious statement that “the wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun doesn’t always shine”, modern conservatives remain strategically silent about the fact that so-called baseload coal-fired power stations are notoriously unreliable, especially on the hottest days when we need power most. Similarly, while their technophobia is on full display when talking about the dangers of batteries for renewable energy storage or driverless electric cars, perplexingly, the modern conservative seems relaxed and comfortable when it comes to the fact that robot trucks and robot trains are proliferating in the mining industry. If conservatives were really concerned about creating jobs in regional Australia, they would insist that none of the new coalmines they are so keen to subsidise use any robot trucks or trains. But they aren’t, so they won’t. Of course, it’s not just technological change that the modern conservatives seem confused about; the desirability of cultural change really twists them in a knot too. Take “traditional family values” for example. On the one hand, modern conservatives rage against the “selfishness” of some parents for denying their children access to a traditional mother and father. But at the same time they’ve created an industrial relations system in which parents – traditional or otherwise – struggle to spend time with their kids because they need to work split shifts, weekends and other unsociable hours. Parents working in the gig economy don’t get paid holiday leave to spend time with their children. Indeed, our Pentecostal prime minister doesn’t even think work on Sundays should be discouraged with penalty rates. While parliament never sits on a Sunday, it seems our religious representatives still expect a cheap coffee on the Sabbath. And then there is freedom. Modern conservatives in Australia are up in arms about Israel Folau’s freedom to say whatever it is he wants to say about homosexuals. Eric Abetz – perhaps the loudest conservative in the Liberal party since the voters of Warringah showed Tony Abbot the door – declared: “The fundamental point of the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of religion is in the DNA of every true Liberal and that is why I am seeking to pursue it.” But Senator Abetz has not always felt the need to defend this “fundamental” principle of free speech. Back in 2014 when he was “public service minister Eric Abetz”, a public servant working at the Australian Taxation Office resigned after being disciplined for making derogatory comments about conservative commentator Melinda Tankard Reist. Commenting on the case, Abetz said this employee’s departure should act as a lesson for the nation’s 165,000 federal public servants and their use of Twitter and other social media. He then went on to state: “APS employees need to ensure that they understand the APS values and code of conduct and how they apply to the official and unofficial communications.” Abetz’s inconsistent indifference to the obligations of employees to follow their employer’s codes of conduct makes clear that the fundamental principle motivating him has more to do with protecting fellow Christians than support for freedom of expression. Of course, it’s not just conservatives who get caught up in the contradictions of modern politics. There are plenty of environmentalists who rely heavily on the CSIRO’s climate science but publicly question the reliability of its GM science. Likewise, there will be more than a few people cheering on GoFundMe’s decision to end Folau’s campaign who were outraged at the thought that a baker might refuse to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. So, what’s going on? Do modern conservatives like new technology or fear it? Do they like freedom of speech or don’t they? And if both conservatives and progressives are capable of inconsistency when it comes to their principles, is there any point (or hope) in having rational debate anymore? I think there is. While the word “ideology” gets thrown around more than it used to, the fact is, ideology is less important than it has ever been. These days, so-called free market ideologues in the Liberal party love to subsidise coalmines while tying unions and charities up in the red tape that they claim to hate. So-called socialists in the Greens want to use market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem isn’t the policy positions of the “free-marketeers” or the “socialists” – it’s the increasingly meaningless labels that are being used. Modern conservatives don’t fear technology, they oppose new technologies that harm their friends. Put simply: renewable energy is a threat to the mining industry, but robot trucks and trains will boost the profits of the mining industry. Modern conservatives don’t fear social change. They oppose social change that undermines the power of institutions that they like, such as the church, and they embrace social change like the gig economy because it undermines the power of institutions they fear, like the unions. It’s no longer ideologies that defines and divides Australian politics, but interests. While the philosophical positions adopted by political parties might be all over the shop, the interests they support remain remarkably stable. The right tend to line up behind wealth, power and the establishment, and the left fire up to support new industries that solve new problems, and to protect marginalised groups from established institutions. There’s nothing wrong with such demarcations, but they have less and less to do with ideology. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/04/fukushima-operator-tepco-restart-nuclear-reactors-kashiwazaki-kariwa","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T09:23:35Z","webTitle":"Fukushima operator can restart nuclear reactors at world's biggest plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/04/fukushima-operator-tepco-restart-nuclear-reactors-kashiwazaki-kariwa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/04/fukushima-operator-tepco-restart-nuclear-reactors-kashiwazaki-kariwa","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima operator can restart nuclear reactors at world's biggest plant","bodyText":"The operator of Japan’s stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been given initial approval to restart reactors at another atomic facility, marking the first step towards the firm’s return to nuclear power generation more than six years after the March 2011 triple meltdown. Japan’s nuclear regulator on Wednesday approved an application from Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) to restart two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant – even as the utility struggles to decommission Fukushima Daiichi. The process will involve reviews and consultations with the public, and the restart is also expected to encounter strong opposition from people living near the plant on the Japan Sea coast of Niigata prefecture. The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) ruled that the No 6 and No 7 reactors, each with a capacity of 1,356 megawatts, met stringent new safety standards introduced after the Fukushima disaster. The authority’s five commissioners voted unanimously to approve the restarts at a meeting on Wednesday. The decision drew criticism from anti-nuclear campaigners. Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany, accused the NRA of being reckless. He added: “It is the same disregard for nuclear risks that resulted in Tepco’s 2011 triple reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi site. Approving the safety of reactors at the world’s largest nuclear plant when it is at extreme risk from major earthquakes completely exposes the weakness of Japan’s nuclear regulator.” Greenpeace said 23 seismic faultlines ran through the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa site. Tepco said in a statement that it took the regulatory authority’s decision seriously and would continue making safety improvements at its plants while it attempted to decommission Fukushima Daiichi and compensate evacuees. Despite the NRA’s approval, it could take years for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa reactors to go back into operation. The governor of Niigata, Ryuichi Yoneyama, has said he will not decide on whether to agree to the restarts until Tepco completes its review of the Fukushima accident – a process that is expected to take at least another three years. Fukushima evacuees voiced anger at the regulator’s decision. “It looks like things are moving forward as if the Fukushima nuclear crisis is over,” Hiroko Matsumoto, who lives in temporary housing, told Kyodo news. Matsumoto, whose home was close to Fukushima Daiichi, said Tepco should “never forget that a serious nuclear accident can cause enormous damage”. Tepco has been seeking permission to restart the idled reactors to help it reduce spending on fossil fuel imports, which have soared since the disaster, triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami, forced the closure of all of Japan’s nuclear reactors. Four have since gone back online after passing safety inspections. The utility faces huge compensation claims from people who were evacuated after three of Fukushima Daiichi’s six reactors went into meltdown on 11 March 2011, as well as a rising decommissioning bill. Earlier this year, the Japan Centre for Economic Research said the total cost of the Fukushima cleanup – which is expected to take up to 40 years – could soar to between 50-70tn yen (£330bn-£470bn). Earlier estimates put the cost at about 22tn yen. Nuclear power is expected to become a key issue in the election later this month. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has argued that reactor restarts are necessary for economic growth and to enable Japan to meet its climate change commitments. The government wants nuclear to provide about 20% of Japan’s energy by 2030. But the newly formed Party of Hope, which has emerged as the main opposition to Abe’s Liberal Democratic party, wants to phase out nuclear power by 2030. Opinion polls show that most Japanese people oppose nuclear restarts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/nov/10/general-election-2019-how-to-send-us-your-stories-and-views","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-14T14:16:35Z","webTitle":"General election 2019: how to send us your stories and views","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/general-election-2019-how-to-send-us-your-stories-and-views","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/nov/10/general-election-2019-how-to-send-us-your-stories-and-views","fields":{"headline":"General election 2019: how to send us your stories and views","bodyText":"With the general election only five weeks away we want readers to help inform our reporting as we follow the politics, the parties and the voters during the election campaign.

People and power: tell us about the issues affecting you As part of a series of pieces from across the country focused on finding out what matters to the people who live there, we want to hear about the big issues facing you. Belfast East Traditionally a unionist seat, Belfast East is facing deep political uncertainty. It’s held by the DUP which supports Brexit but is not happy with Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal in case it weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. Several pro-remain parties such as Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stepped aside in the constituency to give Naomi Long, leader of the centrist Alliance party, a chance at winning the seat. So this election will also be a test of whether the Alliance can rally enough voters who have previously voted along unionist or nationalist lines. Let us know what issues will decide your vote here. Canterbury Are you a young voter in Canterbury? The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party in the 2017 election. Two years later, we’re keen to hear from voters in the city about their views on the election. We’re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017. Are the young people in Canterbury who swung the election last time still motivated or are they split? With the decline of Facebook, how are volunteers and organisers from the main parties getting their message across online? Let us know what you think here. Chingford and Woodford Green The constituency has been represented by Iain Duncan Smith for 27 years, but his majority has fallen sharply and Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen hopes to oust him by focusing on the cuts he helped implement as a Tory minister. Will the contest be driven by the legacy of austerity? Or will Brexit, which divided this area almost 50:50, dominate this election too? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. If you live in the constituency tell us about your views here. Cities of London and Westminster In the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster, which ranges from wealthy neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia to more socially mixed areas such as Soho, Paddington and Pimlico, issues range from homelessness, air quality and local development to the role of the Square Mile. If you live in the area, share your thoughts with us here. Darlington If you live in Darlington, how happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. Get in touch with us here. Morecambe and Lunesdale The seat is considered a bellweather and has been Conservative throughout its history, except for during the Tony Blair years, with the Tory incumbent winning by a 1,399 majority in 2017. There is great wealth but also significant poverty. Helen is particularly interested in hearing from people who live or work in Heysham, a large coastal village which has huge strategic importance for the north-west. It is home to two nuclear power stations and a port, a major distribution hub between the UK and Ireland, which will be affected significantly by Brexit. Yet an estimated 58.2% of the constituency voted to leave the EU. Share your thoughts with us here. Peterborough The Guardian will be reporting from Peterborough, where people have seen public spending fall by £262 a year per person since the start of austerity in 2010 – typical of the UK as a whole. If you live in Peterborough, let us know about the issues affecting you here. Southampton Itchen In Southampton Itchen, Conservative MP Royston Smith is defending one of the smallest majorities in the UK, just 31 votes ahead of Labour. It is one of the constituencies where the student vote could make a big difference. If you are a student in Southampton, we’d like to understand the big issues which concern you and which policies matter to you.

Here are some of the highlights: The cybercriminals allegedly behind the Medibank data breach have threatened to start releasing some of the data since Medibank has refused to pay the ransom. The threats came as a survey from the Australian National University suggests more than six million Australians have fallen victim to a data breach in the last year. The Australian federal police commissioner said women and children recently repatriated from Syria will continue to be assessed by the AFP and counter-terrorism teams. It was revealed in Senate estimates that the Morrison government’s cancellation of the French submarine contract cost $591m. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the Labor caucus that he is “committed” to reforming the administrative appeals tribunal. A senior staff member of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is alleged to have urinated on staff members at a function in Armidale in late 2021, and has now resigned. The Labor senator Glenn Sterle referred to Bridget McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” during a Senate estimates fracas this morning, and later apologised. The royal commission into robodebt heard that a Department of Human Services official nominated a public servant for a 2017 Australia Day award to mark his role designing the botched scheme. The inquiry into alleged war crimes conducted by Australian special forces has expanded beyond the Brereton report, investigators confirmed. And the former Greens leader Bob Brown was arrested in north-eastern Tasmania while protesting against logging in forests that environmentalists say are breeding habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot. Look after yourselves folks, and we’ll see you again tomorrow. Mark Dreyfus says AAT has a ‘completely unacceptable’ bullying record The administrative appeals tribunal has a “completely unacceptable” record of bullying complaints on top of the Coalition’s “miserable record” of stacking the body, the attorney general has said. As we reported earlier, Mark Dreyfus made the comments in question time on Tuesday, seizing on the latest controversy involving the tribunal to bolster Labor’s case to reform or replace it due to partisan appointments made by the Coalition. In opposition, Dreyfus frequently criticised the Coalition’s practice of appointing former staffers and politicians from its ranks to the powerful tribunal, which reviews the merits of government decisions in areas including welfare, immigration and the national disability insurance scheme. The government is actively considering abolishing the AAT and replacing it with a new merits review tribunal. Dreyfus did not rule out that option in June when it was proposed by a Labor-chaired Senate committee. A decision on the AAT’s future is expected as early as December. Read the full story here: I have no context for this but it seems apt for  all this. Emus appear to be causing problems … in the United States. Because people are buying them to keep as pets. Because of TikTok. This is where the entirety of Australia shakes its head in bewilderment. Peter Dutton speaks against Labor’s industrial relations bill The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has spoken in the lower house against the industrial relations bill. He noted the millions of dollars unions have donated to Labor in recent years, arguing in this bill “the government repays them in spades”. Dutton accused Labor of “sacrificing small businesses at the altar of unionism” through a reform that will “usher in economy-wide strikes”. He said the “desire to push the bill through at warp speed” shows disrespect to workers and businesses. Dutton said it was “absolutely unprecedented” for the Fair Work Commission to be given powers to arbitrate intractable disputes, a move that would “kill off bargaining” and move back towards centralised wage fixing. Dutton claimed there is “no shortage of strike action right now” – which ignores that strikes are at their lowest level in decades – citing the RTBU train strike in Sydney as a sign of things to come. That is exactly the sort of dispute that the FWC is likely to be able to arbitrate, getting trains running again. Dutton said: We strongly support choice. If people choose to join a union we honour and respect their choice to do so ... Multi-employer bargaining is a mechanism for unionists to assert their relevance in the 21st century ... Many businesses will have to contend with the union machine, and their mob-like extortion and intimidation for the first time. Dutton said the bill will do “catastrophic damage at a time we can least afford it”. He called on independents in the house and Senate to stand for integrity (and block or significantly amend the bill). Dutton is proposing his own amendments removing the elements of multi-employer bargaining out of the bill, and reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Want to catch up on the day’s events? If you’re not already signed up to our Afternoon Update, I highly recommend you do. You’ll get this nice little curated snippet of everything that’s happened in the past 12 hours sent straight to your inbox, from Antoun Issa. Here’s today’s edition: We had a post from Luke Henriques-Gomes in the blog a little earlier this afternoon – he’s been watching the royal commission into robodebt this week. Here’s his wrap of today’s proceedings so far. The leader of the house, Tony Burke, has successfully moved a motion accelerating and curtailing the House of Representatives debate on Labor’s secure jobs better pay bill. Under the motion, Peter Dutton will have 30 minutes to speak on the bill, then speeches will be cut to 10 minutes as the bill is debated through Tuesday and Wednesday, before a further cut to 5 minutes if the debate is still going on Wednesday evening. Amendments will be voted on in batches, to give it a vote on Thursday. Several independents spoke against the motion. North Sydney MP Kylea Tink said: Just eight business days after the introduction of the most significant IR reform since WorkChoices in 2006, we’re being asked to truncate due process. I welcome discussion [on the bill] but I’m concerned due process is being severely truncated. MP Zali Steggall expressed “disappointment with the government”, after three years of complaints about debate being curtailed it has now used a procedure which “attempts to move past gagging debate altogether” but still curtails debate. The Liberals moved an amendment to neuter the motion. The government won the votes 72 to 67, outvoting the crossbench and opposition. Greens senator Nick McKim is also asking about the stage-three tax cuts, whether abolishing them would reduce inflation more quickly. Treasury deputy secretary Luke Yeaman has said that the inflationary impact of the stage-three tax cuts had already been factored into the budget, and that considering the inflationary impact of the measure was “not the only factor”: If you take more income, and it can be tax cuts or spending on any front ... out of the economy then that is likely to lead to a reduction in economic activity and therefore inflation. I would say though and it is an important point ... that the prevailing economic circumstances matter, as do the effects more broadly of tax changes or any other policy measure frankly on a whole range of other factors such as distribution and participation. That is one factor that you would consider in such a decision, but it is not the only factor. Yeaman rejected the suggestion from McKim that leaving the tax cuts in the budget would be inflationary: I wouldn’t use that term, Senator. However, Yeaman conceded that not proceeding with stage-three tax cuts would effectively be an increase in taxes, which would put downward pressure on inflation. Tasmania police have confirmed they have charged environmental campaigner Bob Brown with trespass following a protest against logging of native forest in the state’s northeast. The 77-year-old ex-Greens leader was one of three environmentalists charged after a protest in what police called a “timber production zone” at Lake Leake. Campaigners say the forest is nesting habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot, a migratory species that scientists say could be extinct in a decade, and which is supposed to be protected under law. A police spokesperson said they were called to the area after reports a group of people were obstructing logging contractors. They said some in the group left without incident, but a man - Brown - initially failed to move on and would be “summonsed to attend court on a trespass matter”. They said: Two women who had secured themselves to logging equipment with metal lock-on devices were arrested and charged with trespass and obstruct police after search and rescue officers had to attend and release them from the equipment. One we missed from earlier today in Estimates: David Pocock asked the Australian Electoral Commission about “doctored superman corflutes from the election campaign” – which depicted him wearing an Australian Greens shirt. The AEC has previously said it considered this to breach section 329 of the Electoral Act, which bans material that “is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote”. AEC officials told Pocock that it can’t prosecute people, but it had referred the matter to the AFP to investigate further. Rain relief on the way – perhaps? – as oceans shift to more neutral conditions Eastern Australia has been enjoying a relatively dry spell of late – unless you’re in the path of some slow-moving major flood waters, such as the Barwon-Darling/Bakka river. The Bureau of Meteorology has updated its climate drivers report, with some good news from the north-west. The negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole has ended, snapping the first recorded back-to-back annual occurrence of this event. During the negative phase, surface waters off north-western Australia are relatively warm (compared with those on the western side of the Indian Ocean), making it more likely for clouds to form. These rainbands stream across the continent in late winter and spring, lifting rainfall as we have seen, particularly in the southeast. The shallow La Niña in the Pacific is also tilting back towards neutral conditions. After three La Niña years in a row, we’ll be glad to see the back of this one, which is likely in January, if not before. Weather and climate, though, don’t switch on or off, and so we’re probably talking about the gradual easing of conditions as summer plays out. As an island continent, though, what happens to the south plays a role too. The Southern Annular Mode – which tends to produce more rain across the nether parts of the country – looks like remaining in its positive phase for now at least. As the bureau notes, that means increased odds of above-average rainfall for the near term for parts of eastern NSW, eastern Victoria, and south-eastern Queensland. (Western Tasmania seems to be the place to head if you want drier-than-usual weather just now.) The wildcard in the pack, though, could be tropical cyclones, which can bring a lot of extra rain to many areas. La Niñas favour more such tempests than usual, which is something we didn’t see in the first two years of this trio. Will we be lucky for a third year in a row? Department of Human Services officials nominated a public servant for a 2017 Australia Day award to mark his role designing the robodebt scheme, a royal commission has heard. Emails presented to the royal commission on Tuesday from November 2016 show that an email from DHS official Scott Britton nominated another official, Jason Ryman, for an Australia Day achievement award for 2017. He was nominated by the department’s compliance branch for “leading the Online Compliance Intervention” project – which was the robodebt scheme. Britton, who was giving evidence on Tuesday, said he did not know if Ryman had received the award. Other emails aired in the commission in early 2017 showed that then human services minister Alan Tudge had written to his department asking for a briefing, including “real life examples” of the use of ATO data to raise debts, in part because the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had read an opinion piece about the scheme. Tudge also requested details of the savings the scheme would generate. The inquiry also heard that throughout the second half of 2016 – after the robodebt scheme had been ramped up – Tudge’s office asked Department of Human Services officials when the scheme would hit a $500m savings target. Departmental emails showed public servants were not aware of any official target, and Britton told the inquiry he expected that the “target” was a milestone that Tudge’s office wanted to mark with a media release. The commission continues. And on that note, I am going to hand you over to Steph Convery for the rest of the afternoon. We have two more days of the house sitting and three more days of estimates, so who knows what could happen! Thank you to everyone who followed along with me today – I will be back early tomorrow morning. Have fun with Steph – in the meantime, take care of you. And in case you haven’t seen it from Josh Taylor: The online safety regulator has written to Elon Musk, cautioning him his company must comply with Australian law and expressing concern about the cuts to the platform’s safety team and proposed changes to verification. Julie Inman Grant, who worked for Twitter prior to becoming Australia’s eSafety commissioner in 2016, told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday she had written to Twitter’s new billionaire owner to seek assurances Twitter would comply with takedown and other government requests. Australia’s online safety act gives the eSafety commissioner powers to issue requests to companies like Twitter to provide information to her about accounts or remove content such as bullying or image-based abuse targeted at Australians. The Coalition’s shadow finance minister Jane Hume is asking about the costing of the stage-three tax cuts, suggesting the new government had costed the measure because it had considered scrapping it. Hume asks why Treasury would cost an “already legislated government policy”. “There is a costing that has been done to remove the stage-three tax cuts,” Hume said. Last month, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, announced that the cost of the stage-three tax cuts had blown out by $11bn over the medium term to $254bn. The finance minister Katy Gallagher said it was a routine budgeting process, and accused the Coalition of leaving the budget in “a mess”. “We wanted a very clear understanding of everything that was and wasn’t in the budget,” Gallagher said. Yeaman said “not surprisingly” Treasury had looked at a range of different options on both the spending and revenue side, “to help inform government decision making”. Hume requested Treasury provide an answer as to when the costing was requested, commenced and completed. Wet girl summer seems inevitable. Greens senator David Shoebridge said estimates has revealed cancelling the French submarine contract cost “half a billion dollars”: Only in a bungled multibillion-dollar Defence project would a government even try to hide a lazy $591m in additional costs. These costs have been ferreted away off the Defence budget, but they will still have to be paid for by the public. It’s the opportunity cost of these funds that really hurts. When we pay an extra $591m for not building submarines we lose those funds for public housing, schools or income relief. While there are strategic arguments for retaining skilled staff, the fact that the ASC contract costs $1.3m for every job is astounding. The ASC contract is filling a staff capacity gap caused by the bungled handling of the future submarine project. This proves that there are far more effective ways to promote employment and economic opportunities across Australia than throwing countless millions at overpriced defence contracts. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has been pushing Treasury on the components of inflation and its previous forecasts, saying that inflation had started rising ahead of the Ukraine invasion. Canavan suggested it was “self-interested” for Treasury to blame the pandemic and the war. Yeaman is outlining how the pandemic and its supply shocks had contributed to initial inflation rises, pointing to shutdowns in China as an example and the shortages of goods. Canavan is also asking Yeaman to explain what Treasury had meant when it talked about possible government intervention in the energy market, asking if price caps were on the table. Sam Reinhardt, deputy secretary of the fiscal group, said that they were looking at a range of options. It’s a significant issue for government, so as you would understand, Senator, there are options along the whole supply chain for electricity generation and we will look at all the options that are available.” Canavan asks if that included looking at any increase in supply, saying Australia should be looking at increasing its exports of gas and coal to help assist other nations, including allies. Reinhardt said that increases in supply that fed into electricity markets would reduce prices, and pointed to a “really substantial number of reforms” in the budget that would increase grid capacity and have a longer term impact on prices. Yeaman said that while Treasury would provide advice, the decision on what type of intervention took place would ultimately come down to the government. Given the market is currently being hit by ... these disruptions, things that act quickly and directly on the price are going to be most effective in our view .... in helping people to deal with the current energy price shock and effect this redistribution of income.” Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the government’s focus was on what could be done in the short term. Economy shows no signs of wage-price spiral, Treasury deputy says Greens senator Nick McKim is asking about the contribution of wages and corporate profits to inflation, with Treasury deputy secretary Luke Yeaman saying there was no evidence of a wage-price spiral emerging in the economy. He said inflation was being driven by external supply shocks and cost pressures coming from the pandemic. McKim pushes Yeaman on whether corporate profiteering was a driver of inflation, saying this was the view of “well-credentialed economists” in Australia and overseas. “Obviously, corporate profitability has been high recently, which is primarily driven from our perspective by the very large increases in commodity prices that we’ve seen recently, and I think fundamentally, the things that are driving inflation are as I said, those cost pressures coming through out of the pandemic and those external supply shocks from outside not corporate profits per se,” Yeaman said. McKim said companies were using the external price shocks as “cover” to jack up their prices, and people who were doing it toughest were getting “smashed”. Yeaman said that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was looking at any potential price gouging. McKim then asks Yeaman about correspondence within the department that said high prices may be coming from “margin rebuild”. McKim and Yeaman are now discussing whether this equates to corporate profiteering, with Yeaman saying that this could mean a return to normal dividends following the pandemic, with McKim saying that rebuilding margins clearly meant making profits. Brewers hope for excise freeze amid warmer weather The beleaguered beer industry has weathered pandemic shutdowns, supply chain issues and the August tax hike, and is hoping for a bumper summer. Coopers Brewery has posted its 2022 results, and managing director Tim Cooper said a 3.5% fall in volume sales was a decent result, “given the supply and demand pressures facing the entire industry”, although he warned the cost-of-living crisis and price increases were affecting people’s purchasing decisions. For Coopers, profit before tax was $27.3m, down from $36.5m the year before. “While the overall market remains tight, we are seeing some positive signs emerging,” Cooper said. The Brewers’ Association of Australia has warned that the next excise increase, in February 2023, could push prices higher still. Chief executive officer, John Preston, said the August increase of 4% was the “highest in 30 years”, and that the February increase would be as high again. Beer is already $15 for a “higher end” pint in some places, he said, and that would become a more common price. Bars then have a choice of absorbing the cost or passing it on, Preston said. The association is calling for an excise freeze, and hoping the warmer weather and post-lockdown crowds deliver for the bars. “We’re just hoping that they get a really good run at it this summer,” Preston said. Mark Dreyfus finishes up the questions with a dixer on the sports rorts Gaetjens report and question time, and my patience for it, ends. Andrew Hastie has a question for Richard Marles: My question is for the minister for defence. The prime minister said he does not want duplication in the national anti-corruption commission. Why is the ADF included in the commission but senior unit leaders are not. Marles: Thank you, Mr Speaker and I thank the member for his question. The military tribunal have their important role to play. The government has committed to producing an anti-corruption commission which is going to be robust in accordance with the commitments that we took to the last election. Adam Bandt has another of the crossbench questions: Greedy energy corporations are driving up bills by 56% while making record profits. prime minister, would you back the Greens plan to freeze electricity bills funded by a windfall tax on gas and energy corporations to deliver immediate relief? Anthony Albanese: What we will be doing – I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. And I thank him for the constructive engagement as well. I understand that we have different solutions that we will present in dealing with the challenge of climate change but I don’t doubt his sincerity in wanting to deal with it. That is the starting point. It is acknowledging the science which is there. We went to the election with a very clear plan. Our powering Australia plan – it acknowledges the changes that are required in our economy that will provide for an 82% share of our energy mix to be renewables by 2030. We understand that that is the cheapest and cleanest form of new energy. I know that, on a number of areas, housing, energy – in these areas – we have had propositions stating we could just take the action of freezing payments as is put forward by the member for Melbourne. It is completely unclear to me and upon any legal advice of how you would do that, in terms of intervening in the way in which the member for Melbourne’s suggested. What the government has to do is to come up with practical plans that make a practical difference. We did that in June by making sure that the lights stayed on. We did that in negotiations that took place with gas suppliers to make sure that we secured the greater than the 56 petajoules that was anticipated would be the shortfall by the ACCC. We will do that as we are working through the current solutions or working through with industry, working through with our departments, working through with manufacturers as well. Because we understand that the increase that is occurring as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in global energy prices that is feeding into global inflation as well, it is a challenge for the economy. We will deal with it with real solutions rather than slogans. That is a Labor way and the responsibility we have as a government. The Liberal MP for O’Connor, Rick Wilson has a question for the prime minister: Can the prime minister please explain why NDIS workers and soldiers will be subject to the national anti-corruption commission but union officials exercising their power under the law of the commonwealth will have a specific exclusion? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for his question. He seems unaware that of course people in the industrial relations system are covered by the Fair Work Ombudsman, as well as the Fair Work Commission. They are subject to that. One of the things that we have done with the national anti-corruption commission – the party may want to talk to the leader of the opposition about this, because he has made it very clear that what we should not do with the national anti-corruption commission is duplicate systems that are in place already. So if you look at for example parliamentarians with IPEA for example are excluded from the provisions. I’ve done that. They’ve done that as a result of the clear indication from those opposite that I agree with, that I agree with as well. That what you need to do with the national anti-corruption commission is fill the gaps which are there. You don’t need to duplicate laws and provisions which are available already. The independent MP for Fowler, Dai Le has another of the crossbench questions: Will the treasurer tell the House how can the government offer additional childcare relief for those earning up to $530,000 while removing the low and middle income tax offsets for individuals and families earning less than $130,000 who need tax relief the most during a cost-of-living crisis? How will the government provide immediate relief for those families struggling, like those in Fowler? Jim Chalmers: Once again, I appreciate the question from the Member for Fowler and thank her for the conversations we’ve had about cost of living in the past. We recognise and understand that when inflation is high and rising for longer than we would like, Australian families and Australians more broadly are under more pressure than we would like and when it comes to low and middle income tax, it was a decision made by our predecessors to end the LMITO [lower and middle income earner tax offsets] and that has ended, that’s a decision that my predecessors [including] treasurer Frydenberg made very clear. What we have tried to do in the budget and what we have done in the budget is to provide cost-of-living relief your constituents and to all of our constituents in a way that does not add to inflation in our economy. We recognise that the reason why real wages are going backwards is because inflation has been too high for too long. We recognise that interest rates are going up because inflation is higher than we want it to be and that is largely a consequence of pressure coming from around the world but it’s felt around the kitchen tables of our communities and so the cost-of-living relief that we are providing in the budget, whether it be cheaper early childhood education, expansion of paid parental leave, whether it be the housing accord to get more, cheaper rental properties into the market, whether it be cheaper medicines, our policies to get wages moving again, all of these things are all about providing the cost-of-living relief that people need and deserve in a way that is not counter-productive by making the inflation problem even worse. So that’s the government’s strategy here. The alternative would be to risk making the inflation problem worse. There is something like $7.5bn of cost-of-living relief flowing in the budget. Obviously, as we go through these challenging times, if there is more that we can responsibly do, obviously we will consider it and will always try to do the right thing by her constituents and all the people be represent in this place. The Liberal MP for Lindsey, Melissa McIntosh has a question for Anthony Albanese that Chris Bowen takes. In Lindsey, the owners of a local cafe, Screaming Beans are struggling with the pressure of rising inflation and power prices. Given the budget indicates that power prices will increase by 56%, why are businesses like Screaming Beans having to pay for the Prime Minister’s broken promise to cut power prices? (Screaming Beans is now in the Hansard. And also, describes my coffee habit.) Bowen: I thank the member for her question and this government is extremely concerned about power prices for businesses, small, medium and large, and power prices for industry and for residents as well. And this government has taken the approach of being straight with the Australian people about the pressures on energy prices, the pressures caused by very high coal and gas import costs. That’s why we took the approach in the budget and the Treasurer took the approach in the budget of being straight with the Australian people. It was an alternative approach, which is not to be straight with the Australian people. We took option A to be straight forward with the Australian people. The previous government took option B, of hiding those price rises. They are in every sense the B team, option B was the one embraced by ... Paul Fletcher has a point of order: Previously on the 1 August you directed a minister to be relevant to the question where a minister had strayed and began talking about the record of the former government. They cannot help themselves, he has done it again, and should be directed back to the question. Milton Dick: The minister has said some context and one minute and I will ask him to return to the specific broken promises alleged in the question. About, and also the rise in power prices which was also in the question which he is referring to and I call the minister. Bowen: In relation to the rising power prices, if the option they took and there has been a development in recent days on this important topic which will be of interest to the house because previously the Member for Hume denied hiding the power price rises and said it did not happen and then he said he did not know about the power price rises when he changed the law and last week of the National Press Club, he said I was acting on departmental advice, Mr Speaker. How pathetic, to blame your public servants for your decision, Mr Speaker. That’s how pathetic these guys are, blaming a department. That is what they are lowered to. That’s why the prime minister, treasurer, resources minister and myself have made it clear we will not be standing by and watching the prices of coal and gas flow through to Australian industries and households, that’s what you did and you did not have the guts to tell the Australian people you could not help them. You hid that from the people and that’s how pathetic you got and how that’s how pathetic you still are. Angus Taylor asks about gas prices, giving Chris Bowen an opportunity to use “well done Angus” (a reference to when Taylor or someone in his office forgot to move to the shadow account on Facebook and meant Taylor ended up congratulating himself for his own announcement). Bowen: I welcome a question from the opposition about gas because it was those opposite that promised a gas-led recovery. Remember that? What they left was a gas-led bin fire. Because on the day that our old friend the Member for Hume announced a gas-led recovery, the price of gas was $4.28 a gigajoule. The gas-led recovery went so well that by the time of the election the price of gas was $34.75 a gigajoule. Well done, Angus! Treasury’s deputy secretary Luke Yeaman is fronting the Senate economics legislation committee for budget estimates. After outlining global and domestic pressures facing the Australian economy, Yeaman – who read an opening statement from Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy who is absent – said that the government will need to address “profound” budget pressures in the future. Beyond the near term, the budget pressures are more profound and will likely require a combination of spending restraint and increases in taxes to reduce deficits and lower debt. We are fortunate in Australia to begin this journey with a relatively lower level of debt as a proportion of GDP than in many countries. Nevertheless, necessary policy decisions will be difficult in order to best promote the national interest.” On energy, Yeaman said Treasury was supportive of government intervention to address surging energy prices in a way that it wouldn’t normally be, saying in usual circumstances high price signals were important to allow for “helpful adjustment” in the market. The circumstances of war-driven price shocks are different and outside the frame of such an approach. In our view such shocks bring into scope government intervention. For example, the current gas and thermal coal price increases are leading to unusually high prices and profits for some companies, prices and profits that are well beyond the usual bounds of investment and profit cycles. The same price increases are leading to a reduction in the real incomes of many people, with the most severely affected being lower income working households. The energy price increases are also significantly reducing the profits of many businesses and raising questions about their viability. Yeaman said that interventions that “directly address the higher domestic thermal coal and gas prices” would be “optimal” and Australia was “uniquely placed” to pursue this type of intervention given it is an energy exporter. He suggested any government intervention should take into account the different level of shock being experienced by different state and territories and that it should also be temporary and “regularly reviewed”. Angus Taylor to Jim Chalmers: Before the election, the prime minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages. Can the prime minister inform Australians how much the cash rate has increased since May 21? The Labor side of the house makes a lot of noise at this, because – audacity. Anthony Albanese: I will ask the treasurer to answer the question but we are not going to take lectures from the lightweight on the hill over there. The Coalition side of the house makes a lot of noise at this, because – theatre. Paul Fletcher wants Albanese to withdraw his “unparliamentary language”. Milton Dick says there was too much noise for him to hear. Jim Chalmers: With questions that bad is it any wonder he hardly ever gets one. It might not have dawned on the shadow treasurer, nor on the dregs of the former government which are arrayed before us … The Coalition again gets up in arms. Dick makes a general warning about language. It seems he heard that one. Chalmers: Would leftovers be parliamentary, Mr Speaker? The government side laughs, Dick tells Chalmers to stop the jokes and get on with the answer. Chalmers: Thank you to the shadow treasurer for a very rare and particularly bad question. Because as everybody else in this House knows, interest rates started going up on their watch. Interest rates started going up for a range of reasons from the extraordinary lows that they were at - 0.1% - and they are currently out to 2.85% as every member of this house knows. Except perhaps the shadow treasurer. Now, if the shadow treasurer had any credibility whatsoever, he would acknowledge first of all that rates started going up on the former government’s watch. And secondly, he would say what members over there said when they started going up during the election, which was interest rates were not going to be at 0.1% for ever. So what we have done and what we have done, Mr Speaker, and one of the reasons why we are proud of the budget we handed down two weeks ago and the shadow treasurer won’t ask me any questions about that budget, but what we did that budget was make sure we were making the inflation problem was. The fact is, we showed remarkable spending restraint and we invested in the supply chain issues which were pushing up ... in the economy. I was asked about interest rate. Taylor starts yelling things and Paul Fletcher jumps up with a point on relevance: That was your promise what are you doing about it? Dick says Chalmers is in order. The treasurer is referring to interest rates which in my understanding is linked to mortgages. So I call the treasurer. Chalmers: You are already far ahead of the shadow treasurer, Mr Speaker, if you make that link and far ahead of the manager of opposition business. Because the point I am making is that the budget we handed down two weeks ago was aimed fairly and squarely at this inflation challenge in our economy, which was a problem before the election, interest rates were going up before the election. They have absolutely no credibility if they won’t acknowledge that. Paul Fletcher is really falling back on his time debating at university. There is plenty of dour flourish in his interjections. Kate Chaney has one of the crossbench questions today: Australia has a history of complex industrial relations regulation and the multi-employer bargaining part of the secure jobs better pay bill is making many employers very nervous. Wages will not increase if businesses and their employees have to navigate an even more complex wage-setting system full of unintended consequences. What does the government think is more important, getting the bill passed urgently or getting it right? Anthony Albanese: I thank the Member for Curtin for her question and for engaging constructively with the government. We had a meeting earlier today in which these issues were canvassed and raised and I’m always happy to meet with members of the crossbench, as I am with anyone in this parliament who has serious policy issues to raise. The fact is that the government that I lead was elected with the mandate to increase people’s wages. We went to an election and cannot have been clearer. We also can’t have been clearer either in the speech I gave to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Sydney during the election campaign. I spoke about the need to get bargaining operating effectively. I spoke about the fact that productivity was flatlining over a considerable period of time and that is the Reserve Bank governor had indicated, that we had a circumstance whereby wages just simply were not keeping up, and that was actually holding back the economy, that’s a constraint on the economy. What we have been doing with the industrial relations legislation is making sure that we consulted not just during that period, not just after we came to office but at the jobs and skill summit, in the lead-up to the legislation being moved by the minister for workplace relations and then, during the inquiry that is taking place into the legislation and also prior to the legislation being debated in this chamber. And as a result of that consultation, extensively, there are a range of amendments that were removed by the government. We do want to make sure that we get this right. But we also want to make sure that wages get moving because we understand the pressure that family budgets are under. And we understand that you cannot have a circumstance whereby particularly feminised industries – our cleaners, our childcare workers, our aged care workers, our disability care workers, heroes of the pandemic – you deserve something more than a thanks. They deserve an increase in their wages. And that’s why what our industrial relations legislation is aimed at doing, is working effectively, constructively with the business community, consulting with COSBOA, ACCI and anyone else who wants to join us in discussing that legislation so I thank the member and other members who contribute constructively to it, you certainly will get it right and get it done. Mark Dreyfus takes a dixer to talk about the bullying claims at the AAT which were raised during estimates: Over recent weeks, those opposite including the opposition leader have complained that the AAT is, his words, stacked with political appointees who cannot be trusted to approve warrants for the proposed new national anti-corruption commission. Those opposite appear to have no sense of irony at all. According to the opposition leader, the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal lack the independence and requisite level of oversight and intellect to perform the important role of approving warrants, even though, as minister for home affairs, the same leader of the opposition radically expanded the role of AAT members in issuing warrants. For the benefit of the opposition leader, yes, the AAT is stacked with political appointees and that’s because he and his colleagues spent almost a decade stacking the AAT with political appointees. They are attacking their own miserable record. The opposition leader and its colleagues are now openly admitting what many of us have been saying for years. … Each year, tens of thousands of Australians rely on the AAT to independently review decisions made by commonwealth departments and ministers that have major and sometimes life altering impacts on their lives. Those opposite do not care about those Australians. Those opposite have never cared about those Australians and they never will and just yesterday we heard more troubling revelations about the internal culture of the AAT, after almost 10 years of Liberal party stacking. Seventeen current members of the tribunal have faced bullying, discrimination or harassment complaints since 1 July 2016. One of those members has had at least five such complaints made of them. That’s completely unacceptable and it’s another problem that our government will have to address. The Liberal party of Australia deserves to be tarnished forever for the legacy of this uniquely disgraceful exhibition of political cronyism which has come at enormous cost to taxpayers to the AAT and to Australia’s system of administrative law more generally. Angie Bell, the Liberal MP for Moncrieff, asks how much wholesale power prices will need to fall for the government to meet its “lower power bills by $275 by 2025” promise. Anthony Albanese gives his same answer he gives to all these questions – moves to renewables, which are the cheapest form of power, the war in Ukraine making things worse, and working towards solutions. The opposition interjects for relevance, as they usually do, it is ignored, as it usually is, and we move on. The first dixer (question written by government tactics team to a member of the government) is also on climate. Anthony Albanese talks about what the government is doing: [Cop27] sits in a context where it comes after the hottest decade on record. And indeed, the past eight years are on track to be the eight warmest on record. Think about that. Every one of the eight hottest years on record is the last eight years! The last eight years. And what we’ve seen, of course, not just the impact of this with the devastating floods in places like Pakistan, we don’t actually have to look offshore. We can look here at the increased number of extreme weather events and the increase in the severity of them. Just before question time, I was speaking to the member for Riverina about Forbes in his electorate that we visited just a couple of weeks ago. We visited as the flood waters were going down. Now, they’ve gone up again and fortunately, for the people of Forbes who have done it so tough, they’ve gone down again. I visited just a week ago, Lismore with the New South Wales premier, where we’re actually having to buy homes to move them out of the flood plain because people do not feel safe in those communities. We’ve had the devastating bushfires, including in areas of rainforest that had never burnt ever before – ever before! And we have the secretary of the UN say last night, “The science is clear, any hope of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees means achieving global net zero emissions by 2050.” But that 1.5 degree goal is on life support and the machines are rattling. This parliament, the major parties apparently are all agreed on zero by 2050. They are all agreed except for the rhetoric, and you wanted to know it if you follow the statements that are aimed. So our government is acting and one of our first acts was to sign up to our changed nationally determined contribution of 43% by 2030. We enshrined in law net zero by 2050 and we are investing in renewable energy. Climate change is a challenge for our generation but it’s also a challenge [for the world]. Peter Dutton to Anthony Albanese: The Coalition has ruled out paying compensation to other nations for the effects of climate change. Will the Albanese government also rule out signing Australia up to compensate other countries as part of the deal at COP27 in Egypt. If you missed it, please read Murph’s column from the weekend: With that in mind, here is Albanese’s answer: One of things that I won’t do is in front of boom mic, make a joke about our island neighbours. That’s one of the things that I won’t do. I won’t do that. And I won’t do that because I want to build good relations with our Pacific neighbours. And one of the things that we provided for, we provided for in the budget for all there to see, and if the leader of the opposition wants to have a look at the budget papers, we’ve made it very clear that one of things that we will do is provide support for our Pacific Island neighbours for infrastructure that needs to be dealing with because of the threat that countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati are experiencing. One of the things that we saw during the election campaign, Mr Speaker, was the Solomon Islands was front and centre of the campaign. The fact that Australia, unfortunately, has stepped back at other nations with the strategic competition that’s occurring in our region. This is one of the things that we have to be strategic of with the national security issue. That is something that is recognised by the United States. It’s something that’s recognised by our other partners, and indeed, our allies. It’s something that was recognised in the Quad Leaders’ Meeting. The first thing that I did as prime minister was get on a plane and visit Tokyo to meet with Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Kushida and President Biden. And there, we spoke about the responsibility that we have as leaders of developed nations to engage in our region. In south-east Asia, in the Indo-Pacific. So what we won’t be doing, Mr Speaker, is trying to score a cheap domestic political point, and at the same time, actually set back our international relations. So you can’t say you care about strategic competition in the region, whilst you continue with this sort of position. No wonder, no wonder that Senator Wong has had to work so hard to restore Australia’s standing in our region. Bob Brown has been arrested in north-eastern Tasmania while protesting against logging in forests that environmentalists say are breeding habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot. Police led the former Greens leader out of the forest on Tuesday morning after he camped with other campaigners in what he called a “squalid” area of logged forest on Monday night. He is believed to have been charged on summons with trespass. Confirmation was being sought from Tasmania police. The swift parrot is a migratory species that spends winters on the mainland and summers nesting in Tasmanian forests depending on where its main food sources, blue and black gums, are flowering. A CSIRO-published guide last year estimated the population had slumped to about 750, down from 2,000 a decade ago. Peer-reviewed studies have suggested it could be extinct in 10 years, and forestry was the greatest threat to its survival. In a statement, Brown said he was under arrest for “upholding the laws of nature and the international biodiversity convention”. We have more than enough plantations to meet the nation’s wood needs. In this extinction crisis, the government will get majority public applause if it ends the unnecessary native forest carnage”. Ahead of question time is a condolence motion for former 1970s Liberal minister, Bob Ellicott. Resources minister Madeleine King was speaking about some of the issues with energy prices on the ABC not so long ago, which included this exchange: Q: You are saying retailers may be part of the problem here? That is where we are seeing increasing prices? King: I think the whole market as a problem, it is opaque, we can’t see into it. Minister Husic gets calls from manufacturers, I get calls from manufacturers, retailers, so you see, we’re all getting scatter-gun answers to these problems and what we really need is to find out the truth, and a transparent market will help us get to that and will put pressure on all providers, wholesalers, retailers, users of gas, gas powered generators to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are doing with the gas that people need. Q: So would you back Ed Husic’s comments when he calls these gas producers greedy, tone deaf, milking gas prices? Is that a fair observation to make? King: It is not the kind of language I would use. Sterle’s comments about McKenzie ‘completely unacceptable’, Watt says Agriculture minister Murray Watt said his Labor colleague Glenn Sterle’s comments about Bridget McKenzie were “completely unacceptable” and said he doesn’t want to hear such words repeated. Sterle, as we reported earlier, described Nationals senator McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” and told her to “be quiet” during a heated argument in a Senate estimates hearing. Sterle eventually apologised and withdrew the comment. Watt, the minister who was at the estimates desk during the argument, was asked about the comments in a brief press conference this afternoon. What Glenn said was completely unacceptable in the modern age. I’ve spoken with Glenn about it and I know he’s remorseful,” Watt said. He’s made his apology but it’s utterly unacceptable for those kinds of remarks to be made in any workplace environment or in society as a whole.” Watt called it “an extremely unfortunate remark that shouldn’t have been made”. I’m pleased Glenn pretty quickly made an apology and recognised that he’d done the wrong thing,” he said. I don’t want to see those kind of remarks made by any senator, no matter what their party is.” You know it is estimates week when there are warring press releases. Mark Dreyfus has just put this out: Contrary to claims made today by the discredited former Home Affairs Minister, overall funding for the Australian Federal Police increased in the Albanese Government’s first Budget. Budget Papers show that in 2022/23 total funding for the AFP is $1.84 billion. As was confirmed today in Senate Estimates, this is a $100 million increase on the AFP’s 2021/22 Budget, and higher than the funding committed in the Coalition’s final budget in March this year when Karen Andrews was the Minister responsible for the AFP. Nita Green: What is the total resourcing for the AFP in the 2022/23 financial year? Charlotte Tressler (AFP CFO): Thank you. The total resourcing for the AFP is $1.8428 billion, so almost $1.9 billion. Green: And how does that compare with the 2021/2022 financial year? Tressler: So, in terms of actual resources spent, as opposed to appropriation, it’s $100 million more than last financial year. This is an increase of more than 5% on the previous year, not a cut. In future, Karen Andrews should take more time reading Budget Papers before rushing out media releases making false claims. And then the apology: Question time is coming up – there is no sign of any random storms so we should get through it with power intact this time round today! The deputy Nationals leader, Perin Davey, has questioned the behaviour of the Labor senator Glenn Sterle, who referred to Bridget McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” during a Senate estimates fracas this morning. Sterle, a government senator for WA, said he was “going to do my block” during a disagreement in the rural and regional affairs committee in Parliament House this morning. McKenzie, the Nationals senator from Victoria, was asking questions of a dairy organisation appearing before the hearing, and pushed back on interjections from other senators about her line of questioning. McKenzie: It’s interesting – I’ve asked a legitimate question ... I would like to continue my questions... you’ve both been yabbering at me. “We’ve been going so well,” Sterle said, before McKenzie appeared to interject to defend herself. Sterle, the committee chair, then spoke up more loudly: Sterle: Senator McKenzie, do you always have to have the last word? I was going to defend you then. Honestly like a naughty little girl, can you be quiet while someone finishes? You don’t have to have the last word... I’m going to do my block in a minute. Sterle gave the call back to McKenzie, before further arguing with the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson about the tone of discussions. Whish-Wilson asked Sterle to withdraw his comment, but Sterle refused. You’re all as bad as each other... I will not withdraw it, I’m probably the easiest one to get on with. McKenzie herself asked Sterle to withdraw, whereupon he apologised and said “you’re not a naughty little girl”. We’ve contacted McKenzie’s office for comment, who declined to add any further to it. But Davey, the Nationals senator from NSW, tweeted in response to a clip of the exchange: Inquiry into alleged war crimes conducted by Australian special forces has expanded beyond Brereton report, investigators confirm Investigators from the Office of the Special Investigator have not yet been able to travel to Afghanistan to investigate alleged war crimes - but they have visited third-party countries. The OSI is the body set up to work with the Australian federal police on the investigation into alleged war crimes stemming from the Brereton inquiry into Australian special forces. The OSI director general, Chris Moraitis, confirmed that the 36 incidents referred to OSI from the Brereton inquiry all remained under active investigation – and the OSI was also investigating additional matters: Yes, senator, as well as other matters that have come to our attention beyond Brereton. Moraitis said OSI sought “evidence where we can” but would not go into operational details. Moraitis said they had not yet been able to travel to Afghanistan (the complicated issue of engagement with the Taliban is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). The Greens senator David Shoebridge asked whether OSI’s investigators had “travelled to countries outside of Australia except for Afghanistan for the purposes of contact with witnesses and investigators”. Moraitis replied: Without going into details, the answer is yes. (He did not say whether this included neighbouring countries such as Pakistan.) Moraitis also told the hearing he was comfortable with OSI’s resourcing. He said the current headcount was 128: We have the option of another 25 or so investigators. We don’t think we need that at the moment. In fact we’re quite happy with what we’ve got. He said OSI had been in close consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but at this stage had not provided any completed briefs of evidence to it. He would not indicate how many partial briefs of evidence provided to the DPP – he said he would “prefer not to” disclose that publicly because he was “still in the process of investigation [and] finalising elements”. Moraitis was vague about when he expected to send first completed brief of evidence to provided to DPP. If he was optimistic he would say “near future”, which he later clarified meant 2023. ABS data shows over 100,000 people moved to Queensland over the last five years (I think the headline for this AAP story should be that more Australians show good sense, but as a Queenslander, I would say that – Amy) Far more people are moving to Queensland than any other state or territory, while NSW recorded the biggest net loss, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows. There was a net gain of more than 100,000 people to the sunshine state in the five years to 2021, according to internal migration numbers from the census. The biggest net loss was just south of the border, as 102,000 people moved out of NSW. There were more modest gains in Tasmania and the ACT, with net increases of 15,000 and 10,000 respectively, while almost 10,000 people left Victoria. Anecdotal stories of sea and tree changes are also backed up by the data, with a net loss of more than 160,000 from Australian capital cities. A senior staff member of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is alleged to have urinated on staff members at a function in Armidale in late 2021. He has now resigned, according to the APVMA’s chief executive, Lisa Croft, who was appearing before Senate estimates. After initially denying that there were any current investigations into sexual harassment within her agency, Croft confirmed that she was “ aware of the matter” and that those directly involved had talked to her about it soon after the incident. No official complaint was made. But she confirmed there had been discussions with HR and that the staff member – a member of the executive team – “resigned soon after the event,” she said. Croft insisted that the urination incident had occurred at a private event, not the office Christmas party as the Greens senator. Peter Whish-Wilson, had initially suggested in his question. The APVMA has struggled to retain staff since being moved to Armidale in 2015 by the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, whose seat includes Armidale. It has been wracked by poor morale and high staff turnover as a result of the move. The minister for agriculture, Murray Watt, said he would be seeking an urgent briefing. These are very concerning questions. It is certainly the first time I have heard about it and I will be seeking an urgent briefing. Labor senator withdraws comment calling Bridget McKenzie ‘a naughty little girl’ It does not matter how frustrated you are, what your politics are, who it is directed towards, or what happened in the past – calling a woman “a naughty little girl” in a professional setting – the parliament no less, where the Respect at Work legislation was only just passed yesterday – is wildly inappropriate and the Labor senator Glenn Sterle deserved to be called out for it. Defence minister calls for ‘industrial base’ across Australia to support defence Richard Marles has spoken at the Submarine Institute of Australia conference, where he had a lot to say about, shockingly, submarines (the topic is kinda there in the title). What does Australia need to prepare for nuclear submarines (referring to Aukus)? Marles said: Before we say nuclear powered submarines, submarines are hugely complex machines, so the process that we have gone through as a country in terms of … working out what capabilities we have to build the Attack-class … is not wasted effort … That is still highly relevant to understand what capabilities we’ve got and what we can bring to bear in this. So I think before we talk about nuclear power, we are planning to build submarines in Australia still, and we’re planning to walk down that path pretty soon and pretty quickly. And so all the work that we had previously done in relation to getting people prepared to participate in Attack applies here. … there are all the issues that I described in relation to nuclear stewardship which we need to be thinking through … it’s kind of, I almost feel, above my paygrade, but it is just the concept that everything is more far more robust. And so we need to be thinking about that. And the final point I’ll make is, a lot of focus has been put on South Australia, that’s appropriate, that is where we will develop the capability to build submarines. WA is going to matter as well, it’s really going to matter. WA is obviously the home to our submarine fleet now [and] will continue to be that going forward and has I think, a very particular role play in the next few years. So we need to be thinking about our infrastructure there. And then the final point I’d make is that to do all of this actually requires a defence industrial base across the country, so, this is going to require a significant national [attention]. What impact have the recent rains had? Coalition looking for ‘sensible amendments’ to anti-corruption bill The Coalition is still hoping for “sensible amendments” to the government’s anti-corruption body, seemingly still committed to a higher bar for public hearings such as an independent judge’s approval. In the opposition party room meeting today, a major point of discussion was the national anti-corruption commission (Nacc). A parliamentary inquiry process is ongoing, and the Coalition’s party room spokesperson said the opposition had the “expectation” that some of their amendments would be advanced, including further safeguards around issues like public hearings. You might remember that the government’s bar for holding public hearings was that they should be “exceptional” circumstances only, which upset some crossbenchers and integrity bodies. The Coalition wanted an even higher threshold, calling for a senior judge to make that decision. The Coalition party room heard around five contributions on the Nacc, with members querying processes around public hearings and claiming the Nacc could be a “point of delay” for infrastructure projects. No decision was made on whether the Coalition would vote for or against the Nacc, based on the success of further amendments, but negotiations continue. Elsewhere, the opposition leader Peter Dutton called the budget a “stinker”, while David Littleproud described Dutton’s budget reply speech as a “watershed” moment. Littleproud also claimed the Labor government “aren’t talking about their budget at all”, which he said “spoke volumes” about cost of living pressures being felt by Australians. Contributions from the Coalition party room included short addresses on cuts to infrastructure funding in their electorates, gas prices, and the annual politicians vs press cricket game over the weekend (won easily by the pollies, thanks to a handy batting knock from several backbench Coalition MPs). ABC staff take issue with Sarah Henderson’s comments on working practices ABC staff are not holding back in correcting the record following some of Sarah Henderson’s comments and questions during senate estimates today. The senator often cites her experience working for the ABC, which occurred during the 1990s. (As an aside, kids who were born when Henderson left the ABC are now primed for their quarter-life crisis. Go well, Gen Z. You’ll get through it. We all do.) Coalition criticises apparent cuts to police and border force budgets Karen Andrews is going hard on cuts today – here is the shadow home affairs minister on what she says is cuts to the AFP’s budget: Today in Senate estimates, Australian Federal Police officials confirmed a cut of $18.46m to this crucial agency. Since coming to office in 2013, the Coalition increased total funding to the AFP to $1.7bn. In the March budget this year, the Coalition invested $170.4m to further develop the capabilities of the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force (ABF) over the next four years. This funding was aimed at hardening Australia’s border against transnational, serious and organised crime (TSOC) by increasing the number of ABF officers at seaports, airports and warehouses and boosting the AFP’s specialist operational, surveillance and criminal asset confiscation capabilities. Any cut to the AFP’s funding is an undermining of our national security and Labor needs to explain what program is now being underfunded by their short-sightedness. Daniel Hurst is listening to that estimates hearing, so I asked him for some context: The $18.46m figure is not a revelation from Senate estimates, although it was discussed during the hearing today. It appears in the AFP’s portfolio budget statement released at the time of the budget last month. What does it involve? The saving of $18.46m for the AFP is listed in 2022-23 as “savings from external labour, and savings from advertising, travel and legal expenses”. This is part of a government-wide cross-portfolio savings measure announced in the budget. However, the same document shows total resourcing for the AFP will increase from $1.88bn in 2021-22 to $1.98bn this financial year. Turns out even economists think it is time for government intervention when it comes to the energy sector: Eric Abetz may be gone from the senate, but his spirit in ABC estimates lives on. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the Labor caucus that he is “committed” to reforming the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, “an institution that has suffered serious harm over recent years”. The comment followed evidence in Senate estimates on Monday that there are 19 members who have had more than one bullying or harassment complaint made against them since 2016, including 17 who are still serving members. Dreyfus is meeting the AAT president this afternoon to discuss what measures have been put in place to deal with the complaints. At the National Press Club in October, Dreyfus used comments from Liberals complaining that the AAT could grant warrants to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to bolster the case to reform or replace the body. Dreyfus said: If ever you wanted a demonstration or a confirmation that something needs to be done about the AAT, there it was with these current members of the opposition attacking, in effect, the partisan appointments that they made with almost 90 failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers, former Liberal members of parliament that have been appointed. In June a Senate committee called for the AAT to be abolished and reconstituted as a new merits appeal body - something Dreyfus has never ruled out. His recent comments sound like he is contemplating something more extensive than just improving the appointment process. NSW parliament says companies should be able to claim back costs of transporting donated surplus food through tax system The NSW parliament has completed an inquiry into food production and supply and made a recommendation: That the NSW Government advocates for reform at the federal level to enable farmer and logistics companies to claim the cost of transporting donated surplus food as tax credits Now the food relief sector wants not just the NSW government to take up that recommendation, but all states and territories, to help make it easier for producers to donate excess stock: Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite have joined forces to lobby governments to make the tax changes: The Foodbank Hunger Report 2022 highlighted that over 2 million Australian households were severely food insecure in the last 12 months, yet the country currently wastes more than 7.6 million tonnes of food each year, costing the economy over $36.6 billion. Of this food, 70% is perfectly edible and redirecting it to food relief would potentially deliver $2 billion in social return. Despite this, Australia’s current tax framework does not motivate food producers to donate excess stock. In fact, in tax terms, donating is no different to recycling or sending to landfill even though it may cost the company more. The tax incentive proposal, developed by KPMG with the support of the Fight Food Waste Cooperative Research Centre, recommends a two-tiered tax incentive based on the ability to offset a percentage of costs related to food donations from taxable income. Its aim is to encourage food producers to donate surplus product to food relief rather than sending it to landfill. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, says his agency will have to step up its protection of high office holders because threats to politicians are increasing. At Senate estimates, Kershaw was asked about the prevalence of threats to MPs and their staff. He said: We are concerned. We’re seeing that around the globe, the threat to high office holders. Unfortunately it seems to be on the increase. Often it is through the online environment that threats are made. Kershaw said the AFP was working with Asio to review how assessments of threats are conducted. They’re a point in time - what can happen in a week can change quickly. He said the AFP was looking at restructuring the protective security command so that it would “coalesce” with its counter-terrorism command and sensitive investigations, “which will bring a whole new doctrine to that command”. Kerhsaw said there was a need to focus on the needs of individual MPs: Some MPs are more comfortable than others. Not that that changes our decision but I think, for us, we’re more and more going to be required to protect our high office holders. Kershaw said that there were “a record number of incidents” during the recent election period, but he did not go into details. He said data would be provided to the Senate committee notice. In Labor caucus, Anthony Albanese spoke about how the budget is being received, criticised Angus Taylor for not asking any questions to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and spoke about the need to get wages moving. He referred to the recent 15% rise in aged care pay and the national minimum wage decision, but didn’t mention the game of Senate chicken the government is engaged in with Senator David Pocock over the secure jobs, better pay bill. Albanese referred to evidence in the robodebt royal commission that the illegality of the scheme was known early on at least by officials. Albanese referred to Australia’s participation in the Cop27 climate summit, and how important it is for international relations, including the fact it was the first topic he and new UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, discussed. Asked what impact the US midterms would have on climate action, Albanese said Australia will respect the outcome of democratic elections, but also noted that Biden’s climate agenda has already passed congress and is being implemented. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he would be meeting the Administrative Appeals Tribunal president this afternoon to discuss evidence of repeat bullying complaints by unnamed members. He reminded caucus he is committed to reforming the body, which he has criticised the Coalition for making partisan appointments to. The caucus agreed to a range of legislation: Allowing law enforcement and emergency agencies access to telco data for missing persons and natural disasters, not just cases involving imminent danger. Forgiving Help debts for doctors and nurses in regional areas, and other technical amendments to the jobs ready graduate scheme. Increasing penalty units from $222 to $275 Approving amendments to the secure jobs, better pay bill Labor will oppose Jacqui Lambie’s private senators bill implementing the veterans suicide royal commission recommendation to allow royal commissions to disregard parliamentary privilege. Being a Tuesday, the party room meetings were held. They have wrapped up – the house will sit from midday – so we will bring you some of what was said. For those who are new here, each of the parties meet on a Tuesday when parliament sits. The meetings are private, but in a very Canberra tradition, a briefing is held afterwards, where one of the MPs reads out the minutes from the meeting. Journalists can ask questions about what was spoken about, but no names are given – it is up to journalists to chase down who might have said what, if needed. The whole briefing is on “background” which means it is not attributed to anyone. It is another of the federal parliamentary reporting quirks which are tradition, but you don’t really find out about until you get here. Business confidence dropping sharply according to NAB survey As we noted in an earlier post, one target of the RBA’s higher interest rates is consumers, but the other is business. NAB’s monthly survey of conditions and confidence in October, also out this morning, revealed the former are holding up but the latter is ebbing. For those hoping for higher wages, there’s not much sign of that happening, with increases lower than in September. Business conditions were down only one point to 22, while profitability edged up by the same amount to 22 too. Workers, though, might have to wait for a bit more to come their way. NAB’s labour cost measure eased to a 3.1% increase in October, slowing from 3.8% during the September quarter. Note that July had a bit of a blip, with the minimum wage increase and superannuation changes. That means subsequent months, including October, will only have had moderate increases. Business confidence, meanwhile, sagged four points to be zero, meaning as many firms are pessimistic as optimistic about the future. NAB said: Confidence fell sharply in transport &amp; utilities, as well as in mining, manufacturing, finance, business &amp; property, recreation &amp; personal services, and wholesale. Victoria, which goes to the polls later this month, saw sentiment sag the most. Alan Oster, NAB’s top economist, said: Despite the strength in conditions, confidence has been falling for several months as headwinds have weighed on the outlook for the global economy and Australia. Could it be that workers will be asked to “tighten their belts” when things start to turn south, before they’ve had much loosening of said clothing accessory? Liberal senators demand to know salaries of high-paid and senior ABC staff A senate estimates committee descended into a shouting match today after Liberal senators demanded ABC managing director David Anderson provide the salaries of presenters and senior staff earning more than $230,000. Anderson refused on privacy grounds, but Liberal senator Sarah Henderson was not satisfied and insisted he had to answer every question asked of him by the senate. The MD was also asked about a speech Four Corners reporter Louise Milligan gave to a women’s legal event, which has been subject to criticism by the Australian newspaper. Henderson claimed some of the women who attended the event were upset by Milligan’s speech. Anderson said the speech was given by Milligan in a private capacity. After Milligan responded to Henderson’s claims on Twitter, the senators began talking about the reporter’s comments about the hearing. Federal police sought help from FBI for Medibank and Optus data breaches, AFP head says Over in the legal and constitutional affairs committee, the commissioner of the Australian federal police, Reece Kershaw, continues to face questions about recent high-profile data breaches. It has previously been confirmed that the AFP has sought help from the FBI in the Optus investigation. The Liberal senator James Paterson asked whether the AFP had also sought help from the FBI in the Medibank case – or just Optus. Kershaw confirmed the assistance of the US agency was sought in “both instances”: I can’t go into the specifics of the investigation but obviously having the strong linkage that we have with the bureau … is a positive in a sense of tracking down those people responsible. Paterson asks if the FBI is involved because of its capability or because of its jurisdiction and laws. Kershaw says: It’s both capability and also the intelligence space. These individuals and/or syndicates operate globally and we’re not just talking to the bureau - there are other police forces in the Five Eyes group. In particular as chair of the Five Eyes law enforcement group, we’ve sent that out to to partners, which is New Zealand, UK authorities, and the Canadians – so we’re going to unite the fight on this in particular on ransomware. Medibank has released a new statement: Medibank is today aware of media reports of a purported threat from a criminal to begin publishing stolen Medibank customer data online in 24 hours. The criminal could also attempt to contact customers directly. Medibank is working with the Australian Government, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police is investigating this cybercrime and trying to prevent the sharing and sale of our customers’ data. Medibank CEO, David Koczkar, said: “Customers should remain vigilant. We knew the publication of data online by the criminal could be a possibility, but the criminal’s threat is still a distressing development for our customers.” We unreservedly apologise to our customers. We take seriously our responsibility to safeguard our customers and support them. The weaponisation of their private information is malicious, and it is an attack on the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. Overnight we again wrote to all customers to update them about this cybercrime. We continue to inform customers of what data we believe has been accessed or stolen and provide advice on what they should do. This is being done via email or letter and in some cases via phone. If you are contacted by someone who claims to have your data, or you are a victim of cybercrime, you can report it at ReportCyber on the Australian Cyber Security Centre website.

She ends up feeling comfortable wearing pants. It’s about individuality and expressing yourself. And given some children feel most comfortable wearing a bike helmet, swim cap, superhero costume or holding a spatula at times, is designed to let them know that expressing themselves is OK and normal. David Anderson continues in that hearing: I think children do dress up senator, and a story about dressing up is acceptable. Alex Antic kept pushing: Do you think this sort of content is contributing to the gender dysphoria problem in this country? Anderson: One, I [think] that complex issues that exist within Australian society … I don’t think we’re generating anything. If anything, the ABC reflects what is happening the Australian community. Antic: What percentage of Australian children are getting read to by people dressed like this, men dressed like this? Anderson: I don’t have the audience data with regard to that but what we have is a story about dressing up. South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic has accused the ABC of “grooming” children, over a children’s story about dress-ups. Antic had issues with girls wearing pants, it appears, which Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called out, particularly over the language he was using. This is a rough transcript of what just happened in senate estimates, with ABC head David Anderson answering Antic’s “questions”. Antic: Mr Anderson, I have got a couple of questions about some programming matters and at the moment the ABC is airing a program called Courtney Act: The Spectacular Suit, in which a male drag actor, Shane Jenek, reads a children’s book called The Spectacular Suit, about a female child wanting to wear male clothing. The program was rated G and has been heavily promoted on TV and on the app. Why is the ABC grooming children with this sort of adult content? Anderson: Senator, I don’t see that as grooming children with our content. That particular program is reading from a book that is about dressing up so I think … Antic: Female children in male children’s clothing, you think that’s not ... Sarah Hanson-Young: You mean young girls wearing pants? Seriously. Antic: I have the call, thank you. Hanson-Young: Well it’s offensive. It is deeply, deeply offensive. Antic: If it’s offensive, you don’t have to hang around Sarah. You don’t have to hang around, Sarah, if you don’t want to. Hanson-Young: Heavens above – girls wearing pants. That is the level of rubbish you are putting forward. Antic: Okay. It is amazing what triggers a response. The truth. The truth that the ABC is grooming our children. Hanson-Young: It is offensive and it needs to be called out. Antic: You are welcome to leave. Hanson-Young: Grooming is a really serious matter! It is not for being played with by conservative senators to make headlines. Antic: That is what grooming looks like. Anderson: My answer is we are not grooming Australian children. Hanson-Young: Sexual assault survivors right around this country will be deeply offended, deeply offended by you playing politics. Anderson is asked to answer the question again: Anderson: I was simply refuting the fact that we were grooming Australian children. Because we are not grooming Australian children … What we are doing, that is about dressing up. Antic: Cross dressing. Let me ask you this, does ABC agree that transgender or cross dressing are adult concepts? Anderson: When it comes to transgender, yes, you can see there are people that wish to identify as a sex other than what they were born as, and I don’t accept what you are saying about somebody who is trans grooming Australian children. That’s not – that whole story time was not about that, it was about dressing up. Parliamentary expenses reporting delayed amid IT issues Expenses reporting for federal parliamentarians will be postponed as the Albanese government cites “severe” delays and major problems with the existing IT system. Senator Tim Ayres revealed the decision made by the special minister of state, Don Farrell, at a Senate estimates hearing this morning, and said the government would ask the auditor general to look into it. The “significant” problems affect the Parliamentary Expenses Management System, or Pems, which is billed as “a secure online portal” for parliamentarians and their staff to manage their office expenses. Ayres told the Finance and Public Administration Committee there had been issues in the development and implementation of the system since 2018. He said public expenditure reporting by parliamentarians was a “vital” transparency measure: It’s become apparent that the system is not progressing as intended and announced by the former government … Delays in the system are now so severe that although the system is functional and claims can continue to be made, they prevent these reports being created and populated. As a result, the government has been advised that significant time and additional work is required to rectify the system and to allow the established system of public reporting to continue. On the advice of the relevant agencies, the special minister of state [Farrell] has authorised a postponement of parliamentarian quarterly reports until the second half of 2023. This is not a decision that the minister has taken lightly. The requirement for public reporting is a key pillar of faith in our parliamentary system and the government has required relevant agencies to put every effort into rectification of this issue. In the government’s view, a fix is not enough. Maintaining transparency and integrity must be the highest priority. As such the special minister of state will write today to the Australian National Audit Office and suggest that this project be the subject of an audit or review should the auditor general deem it necessary. Ayres said Farrell would also write to every parliamentarian with information abut the system. He said briefings would be offered to all MPs and staff, starting with the shadow special minister of state, Jane Hume. Andrews government pledges free vehicle registration for Victorian apprentices The Andrews government has pledged to make vehicle registration free for Victorian apprentices, as part of a $9.7m cost-of-living election commitment. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, made the announcement at a vocational campus in Geelong on Tuesday morning. The government has also committed to establishing a parliamentary inquiry to crack down on bosses and contractors who refuse to pay sub-contractors if re-elected this month. Andrews said the vehicle registration scheme would save apprentices $865 a year and help incentivise people to take up vocational training: We think it’s a really practical, sensible thing to do. From that press conference: Q: Fortem said that got its contract by competitive tender, but the prime minister’s office said that’s not true. You were in government at the time. Can you clarify how that works? Karen Andrews: Yes, I can. So Fortem were engaged in a competitive tender process for the Black Summer fires. And as you heard John Bale say they were one of the final successful tenders. When we needed to look at an opportunity to build capability, we looked at how we could build scale here. Now, it’s the same thing that’s done with manufacturing. You start off with a level of funding and support and you build the scale. We need to build scale and support for our first responders. And that’s exactly what we did. So when we knew that we needed to build more capability, that we needed to make sure that our first responders were being appropriately looked after and cared for after the trauma that they themselves had experienced, we then looked at what we could do to scale it up. And Fortem already had the runs on the board. So this should not be a case of just dealing out small amounts of money to organisations. In Australia, we know that we have to build scale - or the Coalition understands the need to build scale - so there has been a process that has been successful in the past. So this is additional funding that builds on that process. Just to clarify there, it was by competitive tender at the time. My understanding of what happened with the Black Summer fires is that there was a process that was undertaken. It was managed, I believe, through a different department to Home Affairs or PMC but there was a competitive process. John Bale mentioned that when he spoke earlier this morning but I’m more than I’m sure that he is able to provide additional detail exactly of the process that he undertook. But he mentioned four organisations of which two of those were successful as a result of that process that was undertaken. Q: Why would the prime minister’s office then say there wasn’t? Andrews: I have no idea. That is a question for the prime minister (the answer does go on but that’s the relevant bit to the question that was asked) Coalition MPs have held a press conference about the decision to take funding away from Fortem, which provides mental health help to first responders. Karen Andrews: Prime minister Albanese and the Labor government have made a deliberate decision to rip funding away and support away from our first responders. This money was budgeted by the Coalition government and the reason that we provided that funding was to make sure that our first responders are supported. Now, our first responders are the people that are pulling people out of flooded waterways, that are pulling people out of fires, that are rescuing people from car crashes. These people are on the front line making sure that Australians are well looked after, and yet the Albanese Labor government has turned their backs on them by ripping away this funding. Now, this has enormous implications for the health and wellbeing of our first responders. This is a disgraceful decision by the prime minister. He needs to reverse it immediately. Just in case you missed it yesterday, one of the issues the attorney general is chasing up is the revelation of complaints within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which came out of estimates on Monday. Senator Nita Green: Thank you. How many members of the tribunal have had one or more bullying, harassment or discrimination complaint made about them since the first of July 2016? AAT chief operating officer, Jamie Crew: Nineteen members including senior members and deputy presidents have had more than one bullying, harassment or discrimination complaint made about them since 1 July 2016. Crew then gives more detail: So I think, Senator, we’ve provided some clarification about how we’ve interpreted that phrase. So we’ve interpreted the phrase more than to mean one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more ,five or more complaints received during that period. So more than one bullying complaint was 19 [people]. More than two was six [people]. More than three was three [people]; more than four was two [people]; and then more than five was one [person]. Extension of Collins class submarine lifespans to begin in 2026 The Royal Australian Navy’s director general of submarines, Commodore Tom Phillips, has spoken about the technically challenging plans to extend the life of the existing Collins class diesel-electric submarines. The life-of-type extension program begins in 2026 starting with HMAS Farncomb. Each upgrade will require extensive work and is expected to extend the life of each submarine by 10 years. This is intended to bridge any gap before the new nuclear-powered submarines under Aukus are ready. Phillips told the Submarine Institute of Australian conference in Canberra today that the purchase of items with long lead times for the extension of HMAS Farncomb had begun. He said he did not underestimate the technical challenges of the work: We’re full aware of the risk and technical challenge and we are bringing all forces to bear in the design effort to [reduce] that risk before 2026. Phillips also mentioned that the new east coast submarine base (the location has not yet been decided out of Newcastle, Port Kembla and Brisbane). He said the base would not only be a submarine base but would also support a range of other undersea capabilities. He said HMAS Stirling – the existing naval base in Western Australia – would remain a premier submarine base “for quite some time to go” and into the future (ie it will not be closed when the new base on the east coast opens). Consumer sentiment dims to first Covid wave levels If the theoretical framework underpinning the RBA’s rate rise binge is to cruel demand, last week’s seventh rise in borrowing costs in as many months seems to be having some of the desired effect. The latest weekly survey of consumer sentiment by the ANZ and Roy Morgan shows the sixth decline in a row, bringing the gauge to levels not seen since April 2020 when the first Covid wave was cresting. David Plank, ANZ’s head of Australian economics, says most measures were lower, including the economic conditions next year subindex, which has sagged 17% over the past nine weeks. What the RBA wants to see, though, is falling expectations about how high inflation will go. Alas, that arrow is still pointed in the wrong direction. Those concerns are now at their highest level since the data series began in April 2010. One slightly contrary mood, though, is a rise in consumer confidence among those paying off their mortgage, with the gauge up 2.6%. That sentiment may not keep rising if the markets are any guide, though. Investors are predicting the RBA will hike again next month (with a two-thirds chance of another 25 basis-point rise to 3.1%.) If the market’s right, the cash rate will top 4% in about a year’s time (though most economists predict the RBA will stop well shy of that). Labor announces $5m to encourage women to run for office Katy Gallagher has announced $5m over five years to boost the number of women in public office. The women in public office grant is designed to encourage – and prepare – more women to run for elections at all levels. From the minister’s release: Projects will address barriers to entering office and provide women candidates with a clear understanding of political process and candidate expectations. Applications will need to clearly demonstrate that activities have no political affiliations or agendas, and are accessible to all women across the political spectrum. Eligible organisations currently delivering programs, initiatives and resources that encourage and prepare women to run for public office are invited to apply. Proposed projects must complement or expand, and not duplicate, existing programs aimed at helping women gain public office positions. The Women in Public Office grant opportunity opens on Tuesday 8 November 2022 and closes Monday 19 December 2022. A virtual information briefing will be hosted by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Office for Women from 10am to 11:30am on Wednesday 16 November. Interested organisation are encouraged to attend. Further information on the grant opportunity and the virtual information briefing is available on GrantConnect. In the New South Wales parliament today, the Greens will introduce a bill to ban native forestry operations in koala habitat. The bill would amend forestry laws to make logging an offence in areas of regional koala significance. The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the bill was an essential step to saving koalas from extinction: If the government was serious about protecting koalas or any of our native animals threatened with extinction then they could introduce a bill to do so – just like I am doing today. It would save NSW money and save many of our forest-dependent threatened species from extinction by taking a proactive approach to a looming crisis for industry and nature. It is unclear whether the bill will be debated before the NSW parliament wraps up for the year ahead of the March election but the Greens say they will reintroduce the legislation next year regardless of who wins government. The Greens federal environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the bill to end forestry operations in koala habitat was a step towards what was ultimately needed in NSW, which was an end to all native forest logging: There must be an end in sight to this destructive industry, for the sake of our precious forests and the wildlife that call them home. In federal parliament, the Greens have proposed legislation that would put a moratorium on clearing of critical koala habitat. Liberal senator says teal independents were ‘bought and paid for by some of Australia’s richest people’ James Paterson was also salty about the amount of money Climate 200 raised: I thought it was extraordinary that the Climate 200 movement raised about $13m and that more than a third of that, almost $5m, came from just three political donors. If the Liberal party collected that much donations from that many high net worth individuals, or the Labor party collected that much donations from the union movement, there would be outrage and the loudest criticisms would be coming from the crossbenchers and the teals. They would say this is democracy being bought by rich people and they’d be outraged. So, I think they need to reflect on what they told the electorate and what they’ve been saying for months, which is that they’re supposedly a people-powered movement with thousands of grassroots donors. Now we know the truth. They are bought and paid for by some of Australia’s richest people who stand to benefit from the policies that they advocate. He says the phenomenal amounts of money the major parties raise, including the Liberals, is different because they contest more electorates. If they contested every electorate in the country and spent as much as they did in those electorates, they would massively outspend us. It’s extraordinary to be spending $2m or thereabouts on a single seat. Most Liberal party candidates, including MPs who are re-elected, spend nowhere near that amount of money. This is an extraordinary amount of money, an unusual amount of money, and it is an innovation that teals have brought to our political system despite their criticism of money in politics. There didn’t seem to be the same criticism for Clive Palmer’s spend. The Liberal senator James Paterson also says looking at officially banning ransom payments is something the parliament might need to consider. He held a brief doorstop (a quick press conference) where he said: People do advocate from time to time the banning of ransom payments. I think that’s something the parliament needs to carefully consider. It certainly is the advice of the Australian government consistently not to pay ransom because there is no guarantee that you’ll get your data back and you are contributing to others being hacked in the future by paying ransom. So, I think that’s something the parliament needs to consider. Women and children recently repatriated from Syria will continue to be assessed by AFP and counter-terror teams, says AFP boss Reece Kershaw also addressed the recent repatriation of women and children from Syria as part of Operation Ammersoyen-Alsunga. Kershaw said: Our established relationships offshore also assisted with the repatriation of four women and 13 children from detention camps in north-east Syria. The individuals who recently returned to Australia will continue to be assessed by the AFP and our partners through our joint counter terrorism teams. I have confidence in the well-established framework that enables the AFP to respond and manage extremist threats in Australia, including our community liaison teams, which will work with community leaders to support these returned individuals. The Liberal senator Paul Scarr is asking the AFP whether it is investigating the unauthorised disclosure of information about the operation to the Australian newspaper. Kershaw said the AFP requires a “harm statement” to assess whether the leak is worth investigating. “We’re going through that process now,” he said. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has opened Senate estimates with a statement about the Optus and Medibank data breaches. Kershaw said: As chair of the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, which includes agencies from the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada, I know partnerships are crucial in combating cybercrime. The FBI is assisting in the AFP-led Operational Hurricane, which is focused on identifying the perpetrator or perpetrators responsible for the Optus data breach. The AFP is also leading Operation Guardian, which has the objective of protecting more than 10,000 Optus customers, whose identification credentials were unlawfully released online. Recently, a Sydney man was charged under Operation Guardian for allegedly attempting to blackmail Optus customers. He faces up to 10 years’ imprisonment. We also launched Operation Pallidus to investigate the data breach against Medibank Private and Operation Allora to investigate the MyDeal data breach. The AFP has invested significant resources into these investigations, which will be long and complex. And apart from sending a warning to cybercriminals that the AFP will relentlessly pursue them, I also have a message to business: please alert authorities immediately when a data breach is suspected. It’s like any crime scene. The longer it takes relevant agencies to be informed, the harder it is for perpetrators to be identified, disrupted or brought to justice. ‘Profoundly important’ to convey Aukus submarines’ strategic advantage to Australian public, deputy PM says The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has implicitly acknowledged that the government will have to persuade the public of the need to spend vast sums of money on nuclear-powered submarines under Aukus. Australia, the US and the UK are expected to conclude their work early next year to determine the way for Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Speaking at a Submarine Institute of Australia conference in Canberra this morning, Marles reiterated his view about what submarines could deliver in a strategic sense: We are buying a large question mark in an adversary’s mind. But Marles said he saw it as “profoundly important” to convey that message to the Australian public, “so that people can understand why we are spending an enormous amount of money” on a a comparatively small number of platforms. (The cost of the new submarines is not yet known, but previous estimates by analysts have put it well north of $100bn. This all comes at a time of budgetary and economic pressure.) The cybercriminals allegedly behind the Medibank data breach have threatened to start releasing some of the data they took now that Medibank have refused to pay the ransom (a position backed by the government). The Liberal senator James Paterson told Sky News it was a worrying time: I think the unfortunate thing about the Medibank crisis is that the company’s understanding of the attack has evolved. And yesterday I asked the information commissioner before the Senate estimates about that and she said that’s a matter of active investigation because it is important that companies disclose what they know when they know it, and it will be important to understand whether Medibank has done that. But that’s kind of for after the crisis. We just need to get through the crisis at this stage. I understand that Medibank is cooperating with the Australian Cyber Security Centre, who will be also appearing before Senate estimates this afternoon, and we’ll discuss that further with them. It’s critical that they continue their cooperations to protect their customers as best they can. David Pocock continues to support splitting IR bill The ACT senator David Pocock has spoken to ABC Canberra about what changes he would like to see in the government’s industrial relations bill. Pocock has proposed splitting the bill to pass the low-paid and cooperative multi-employer bargaining streams this year, and deal with the more controversial “single-interest” stream next year. Asked what changes he would like, Pocock said: The stream that is causing the most grief is the single-interest [stream] ... so we’re looking more at that and I’ll be waiting to see the details of these amendments that have been flagged. There’s a Senate committee process still under way ... There’s three more, three more, full days of Senate committee hearings. And then the committee will hand down its report. And the minister’s already flagged that there will likely be amendments from that. And for the ACT, we’re a city of small businesses. We have to ensure that we are getting wages moving. And also looking after small businesses ensuring that the system is is simple enough to work for them and be understandable. And one of the issues that has been raised by small business, across the ACT is the definition of a small business, being 15 headcount, not 15 full-time equivalent. Which potentially scoops up a huge number of, you know, smaller cafes and all sorts across the territory. Small businesses are exempted from being compelled by their employees to join a multi-employer pay deal, so changing the definition to 15 full-time equivalent, not 15 employees, would broaden that safeguard. Monarchist league chair says government’s republican ‘scheming’ amounts to ‘acts of deceit … worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy’ The national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, Philip Benwell, is quite agitated by the idea that King Charles III may not appear on the $5 note. It is the decision of Dr Philip Lowe, as the governor of the reserve bank, but Lowe is consulting with the government. Last week, treasurer Jim Chalmers said he would like to see an Australian on the note. Benwell is outraged and thinks removing the regent’s image from the note is the first step towards a campaign to make Australia become a republic (which is not something the government is planning for this term, but is on the agenda for any potential future terms): There was a time when, following an election, people thought that a government in power was for all people, but obviously not this government which obviously intends to embark upon a Keating-style campaign of republican attrition commencing with the removal of the monarch’s image from the $5 note. One wonders how Mr Albanese and his cohorts will be able to face the monarch in the eye when they rush to London to attend his coronation when, at the same time, they are scheming to get rid of him. These acts of deceit are worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy. How duplicitous could anyone be? Firstly they dump the King from Australia’s $5 note and then pay homage to the King on a taxpayer-funded cavalcade of exclusivity costing the people upwards of a million dollars, better spent on reducing the cost of living for ordinary Australians. Meanwhile, Bridget McKenzie still has this to deal with: Opposition expected to focus on redirected regional funds in budget estimates Budget estimates is back on today and the opposition are focusing on where money has been taken from regional Australia as part of the redirection of funds. Labor scrapped the funds which the previous government had given Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals as a balm for supporting Scott Morrison’s net zero by 2050 target. A joint release from Coalition MPs was sent this morning on some of the funds which have been redirected: The Coalition Government backed in our essential first responders by providing $10 million over two years to charity organisation Fortem Australia, for essential mental health and wellbeing support for those assisting during natural disasters. However, Labor’s first Budget ripped $8 million in funding from the organisation, which means they are unable to open services in important regional locations like Townsville, Ballina, Albury-Wodonga, Gippsland, Dubbo, Nowra, Newcastle, Sunshine Coast, Darwin, Launceston and Perth. Labor is ripping money from regional Australia, just like they did with the Building Better Regions Fund. Labor’s blatant carelessness for the wellbeing of our first responders needs immediate rectification. The Opposition is calling on Labor to urgently reverse this funding cut. Expect to see more of that. Allegra Spender: Neither major party took available chance to change political donation regime Allegra Spender said she believed a citizens’ assembly (like a big jury) should be involved in setting the rules for election spending and fundraising. Why? I think because people don’t trust politicians to make up the rules for their own political funding their campaigns. I believe that if we actually listen to everyday people’s, you know – get together a group, a bit like a jury, of just people from broad parts of Australia, and said, ‘Okay, how do you believe politics should be funded’, and they were given the time and resources to really debate that … then I believe that [we could] come up with some great outcomes. You see that very much in – we’ve seen other countries like Ireland use that same model to debate something really contentious, which was the abortion laws, and come up with a community something that was backed by the whole community. I think, if you can really put politics back in the hands of the community – if you can do politics differently, then I think we will all be better off for it. And so that’s why I’m a strong advocate for that approach to resolve political donations, because, you know, both major parties have had a chance to change the political donation regime, and neither of them have made the major changes. You know, both of them could have stopped Clive Palmer spending over $100m on political donations, but they haven’t. And so I think this is a change. I think that we could really see a fundamental shift in political funding. Allegra Spender was also asked about how much money she and some of the other independents spent on their election campaigns. She said: It was, I know, it was an expensive campaign … For me, I think the biggest difference, however, was the volunteers. So we had over 1,500 volunteers in our campaign who, you know – when you ask people [about] what made the difference, it’s people … the visibility of people who said, I care about climate change, I care about integrity, I care about a future-focused economy and I’m going to support an independent … So I’m really proud of of the volunteers and I’m very grateful for the donations as well because honestly, if you’re in an independent and you need it’s a lot just to be known in the community. That takes a lot of time. But I also agree with you, PK, and I believe we should fundamentally reform how we do political spending, but I can’t do that on my own. You actually need to get that across the parliament. And that’s something that I’m going to be driving as part of my time here. It does have to be said, though, that small businesses don’t tend to be unionised, even when a majority of Australians were unionised (which was about 30 or so years ago). The bill does not cover businesses with less than 15 employees, or those with their own enterprise bargaining agreements. So that takes out a whole heap of small businesses. Plus, a majority of employees in that small business would have to vote to take part in multi-employer bargaining. So there are some protections in there for small businesses. It is also worth noting that a lot of the big business lobby groups are spending a lot of time advocating for small business in this debate. Which they don’t represent. The Senate won’t sit until parliament resumes in a couple of weeks. It’s going to be an interesting time. Wentworth independent MP Allegra Spender is now speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast and she is raising her concerns with the IR bill being rushed. The government doesn’t need the crossbench in the house – it has the numbers itself. But it would be a very brave government indeed to ignore such a strong crossbench, which was elected by constituents who wanted politics done differently. Spender says she is concerned with unintended consequences and everyone just needs more time to examine things like multi-employer bargaining: Look, I believe, honestly that we should split the bill. I think there are elements of the bill that are particularly focused on low paid workers. And on feminised industries and around gender equity, that I believe there’s a lot of consensus around, you know, there’s business and unions have been working together on these areas for a long time and I think we could pass those parts of the bill by Christmas. It is particularly however, the multi sector employer bargaining and particularly the piece where it’s forced bargaining buyers, you know, businesses that have never been forced into multi employer bargains. I think we should take a really big pause on and look at the legislation in detail, because industrial relations legislation is some of the most complicated in our history, and you just need to see that you know, so many problems, actually, with the Fair Work Act are being trying to fix in this legislation, because there were problems in their Fair Work Act, which actually made it hard for businesses and workers to bargain together. So I think we should be very cautious because otherwise you’re going to end up with a lot of unintended consequences. But Tony Burke also concedes there that there won’t be a vote on the IR bill “for a couple of weeks”. That is government code for – we aren’t close enough to having the votes yet. Patricia Karvelas puts to Tony Burke Jacqui Lambie’s statement that it will be a “miracle” to have the bill past by Christmas. Burke laughs and says the miracle might be getting Lambie across the line, but he’s not giving up on any option: She’s made her own views really clear. And I don’t think anyone’s got a better turn of phrase than Jacqui Lambie when it comes to the parliament. There have been lots of occasions where things have looked to be impossible and the parliament has ended up finding a way. And I’ll tell you if there was an issue where we should be trying to find a way right now, it’s at the core of the cost-of-living challenges. A whole lot of the inflationary pressures are international. There’s some we can do things about; there’s a lot that we can’t. We can do something about wages, and we really need to. Tony Burke: The pressure that is being felt is real. The sooner we act, the sooner pay will go up. And that’s why I’m doing everything I can to try to make sure we can get those wages moving for Australians this year. Tony Burke doesn’t want to take out the single-interest stream as yet because “I want to get wages moving for as many people as possible”. The single-interest stream is one part of multi-employer bargaining – the bill authorises workers with common interests to bargain together, where it is in the public interest for them to do so (thanks, Paul). That’s what David Pocock wants carved out, so he can have more time to consult. That’s what the government doesn’t want to move on. If you are looking for an explainer on the legislation we’ll be talking about today, Paul Karp has you covered: Tony Burke is also being quite conciliatory about David Pocock’s concerns about the bill. Asked by Patricia Karvelas if he is prepared to make more amendments to the IR bill, Tony Burke says that is standard after a senate inquiry process. So yes, there will be more amendments, Burke says. I suspect there’ll be more to come. Tony Burke is quick off the blocks this morning – he will be on ABC radio RN Breakfast very soon. A new survey suggests around one in three Australians, or more than 6 million people, have fallen victim to a data breach in the last year, with young people the most likely to have their information exposed. The latest round of the ANUpoll, from the Australian National University, found an overwhelming percentage of people backed stronger penalties against companies not adequately protecting data, and better regulation from government. It comes in the wake of high-profile breaches experienced by customers of Optus, Medibank and more, with the federal government promising tighter data rules and bigger penalties for errors. The representative poll of nearly 3,500 Australians, released on Tuesday, asked “‘Have you, or a member of your household, been the victim of a data breach in the last 12 months?” Some 31.2% of men and 32.8% of women responded yes. Prof Nicholas Biddle, from the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods, said: Roughly one third of adult Australians, or around 6.4 million people, have been the victim of a breach in the last 12 months. In comparison our survey found only 11.2 per cent of Australians had been the victim of serious crimes like burglary or assault in the last five years. As our lives become more and more dominated by data, so too does our exposure to data related crime. This is a serious issue that needs serious attention. The poll found that the most likely group to become data breach victims was the 25-34 age bracket, with around 41.5% saying they’d been exposed. More than 96% of respondents said they wanted to see significant penalties against companies “that do not adequately protect consumer data”, Biddle said: And 92.8 per cent of Australian adults think government regulation of new technologies is crucial for consumer protection. At the same time, 90.6 per cent think government should regulate companies’ use of data. Breaches like the Optus breach clearly impact on trust in the whole system of data governance, and Australians are crying out for stronger regulation and better protection. Sticking with the defence strategic review, and the university sector has warned of critical skills shortages including in cybersecurity fields. Universities Australia released its submission to the defence strategic review overnight and said Defence was “not immune to the skills crisis rippling through our economy”: Skill shortages are plaguing many areas of our defence force, defence industries and complementary sectors, with the shortfall of cybersecurity professionals alone tipped to hit up to 30,000 unfilled positions over the next four years. Universities Australia’s submission sets out proposals to address Defence’s workforce challenges. These include expanding the Defence University Sponsorship Program to sponsor individual students to study a full Defence-relevant degree (rather than having them apply after one year) at any Australian university, The sector also suggests offering students a broader range of internships and work integrated learning experiences; reconsidering the eligibility requirements for Defence internships; making it easier for non-university-educated workers to transition to university study; and boosting research partnerships between Defence and regional universities. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said university-educated workers across all the disciplines – in STEM, humanities and social sciences – would be central to building Australia’s defence capability: The success of security pacts like the Aukus arrangement hinge on the capacity of these researchers and highly skilled workers. A new report warns that the forthcoming defence strategic review faces an “exploding suitcase” of challenges. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute report says the leaders of the review, Angus Houston and Stephen Smith, are tasked with delivering new military acquisitions faster in the next decade, but it says the existing acquisition plan is “probably already unaffordable”: That is, more funding will likely be necessary even before additional capabilities are added to the shopping list ... And with nuclear-powered submarines and frigates on the untouchable list, the challenge of delivering more sooner gets even harder, as those two projects will consume tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade even before they deliver their first vessels. The report’s author, senior analyst Marcus Hellyer, provided an update on the state of defence funding following the October budget: Defence is facing the same challenge as Australian mums and dads: inflation is rapidly eroding buying power. While on paper Defence is getting a 7% budget increase in 2022-23, once we take inflation into account it’s only around 1%. That’s probably not enough to afford its shopping list of new equipment. There’s no pot of gold available to cover increased defence spending. That doesn’t mean the government can’t or won’t increase defence spending once it gets the DSR’s recommendations, but any increase will require either higher taxes (which appears unlikely, since the government is proceeding with its predecessor’s planned tax cuts), greater borrowing (accelerating the vicious cycle of debts and deficits), or cuts to other priorities that have constituencies of their own. (ASPI receives funding from defence but says its editorial judgments are independent.) Gaetjens report into sports rorts criticises ‘lack of transparency’ A little bit more on that Gaetjens report which is sure to garner a lot of reaction this morning after it was finally obtained last night through that FOI request, two years after the investigation by the former head of the prime minister’s department. These are the key quotes from Phil Gaetjens relating to decisions made by then sports minister Bridget McKenzie that brazenly channelled funding to Coalition electorates. Gaetjens wrote: This lack of transparency coupled with the significant divergences between projects recommended by Sport Australia and those approved by the minister has given rise to concerns about the decision making. The report also states: Those submitting grant funding applications had, in my view, a right to more fully understand the basis on which the funding decisions were being made. Our reporter Jordyn Beazley has been talking to people who have turned to buy now, pay later credit schemes to get them through the cost of living crisis. They describe how it can be a tempting fix but can soon lead to much greater financial strife. Experts fear the schemes, which have mushroomed in recent years, will leave more and more people stuck in a “revolving door” of bad debt. Read her full report here: Welcome to Tuesday, also known as ‘the government starts the IR fight in earnest’ day. Tony Burke will be introducing the amendments (concessions) the government has made on the bill, but the government is still trying to push it through on a very tight timetable. It wants the bill passed by the end of the sittings – which is essentially just two weeks – and two of the senators the government needs, Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock, want more time. For those who need a refresher, here are the main amendments Burke will be introducing today; Requiring majority support from employees of each employer for a single interest bargaining stream authorisation. Providing that businesses and workers cannot be compelled into an authorisation or single interest employer agreement when they have agreed to bargain for a proposed single enterprise agreement, and a six-month grace period where there is a history of effective bargaining. Making further changes to the Better Off Overall Test to ensure new employees under an agreement are not left worse off; Clarifying that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied a minimum period of good-faith bargaining has occurred before moving to arbitrate; Establish the government’s promised new national construction industry forum as a statutory advisory body. Giving business 12 months to adjust to changes to fixed-term contracts. But Lambie and Pocock still don’t want to rush. They want to split the bill, which the government does not want to do. Meanwhile, the resources industry is preparing a multimillion-dollar campaign arguing against the IR changes. There is still the rumour that the parliament, or at least the senate, will sit for another week in early December, given there is so much for the senate to get through. If that happens, it would give the government another week to negotiate for the numbers it needs to pass IR. But that, I understand, is still a last resort. We’ll see how today plays out. Meanwhile, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warns the defence strategic review faces an “exploding suitcase” of issues, including cost, Daniel Hurst reports. It seems inflation is also affecting the defence force’s buying power. Yet another issue the government needs to deal with, and one that already comes with a whole bunch of political landmines. Good times ahead. And of course, we still have budget estimates. Because there is no such thing as too much fun. We will cover all of the day’s events and more. You have the Canberra team of Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Dan Hurst at your disposal, and me, Amy Remeikis on the blog. Mike Bowers sends his love as he works on some other projects. Guardian Australia’s exceptionally hardworking team around the country will keep you up to date with what is happening outside of the federal parliament – we’ll make sure you are all across any breaking news. I have already had three coffees. It’s only Tuesday and I am already out of coffee grounds. Ready? Let’s get into it. Good morning. Welcome to the Australia politics blog. Amy Remeikis will be along soon to take you through the day but before then here’s a quick roundup of the stories making news this morning. The secret report by the former Coalition government into the sports rorts scandal has criticised the decision-making process by former sports minister Bridget McKenzie and its “lack of transparency”. The findings by former top public servant Phil Gaetjens were kept secret for two years but have been revealed by a freedom of information request. Sewage leaks into flood waters are being blamed for “massive fish kills” along parts of the Murray River system in northern Victoria. Authorities have warned residents to stay clear of the water which some believe has been contaminated with human waste in the wake of the catastrophic flooding events of the past few weeks. The aftermath of natural disasters are also a key focus at the Cop27 climate summit that began in Egypt overnight. As around 100 world leaders gathered in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, they were told by the UN chief, Antonio Guterres, that the globe was on a “highway to climate hell”. But the devil will be in the detail at the two-week talks, with the thorniest issue being “loss and damage” funding for developing countries hit by climate-related disasters. Chris Bowen will be representing the federal government. Follow our live coverage of the summit here and there’s lots more coverage of the event here. And in Canberra, despite making concessions, the government is struggling to get its workplace relations reform past the crossbenchers in the Senate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/apr/18/malicious-shorten-and-business-groups-defy-coalitions-assault-on-climate-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-18T07:26:47Z","webTitle":"'Malicious': Shorten and business groups defy Coalition's assault on climate policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/18/malicious-shorten-and-business-groups-defy-coalitions-assault-on-climate-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/apr/18/malicious-shorten-and-business-groups-defy-coalitions-assault-on-climate-policy","fields":{"headline":"'Malicious': Shorten and business groups defy Coalition's assault on climate policy","bodyText":"Business groups are defying the Morrison government’s political assault on the use of international permits, arguing a credible climate policy should include access to high-quality international offsets, because they are a key mechanism to help Australia meet its Paris target. With climate change persisting as a significant campaign flashpoint, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, told Guardian Australia international permits were part of the toolkit for mitigating climate change in a cost-effective way. “Australia’s carbon emissions reduction policies should be stable, predictable and provide long-term certainty for business,” Pearson said. “They should include access to credible international offsets; be market-based; implemented nationally; and minimise the potential for carbon leakage”. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors, such as super funds, with total funds under management of over $2tn, said international carbon credits were a key component of meeting Australia’s Paris targets. “They must have integrity and there should be limits on the amount you can use, but there is wide agreement that they have to be part of the policy toolkit,” Herd said. She noted that the Morrison government – despite its recent criticisms – had been “negotiating hard” for Article 6 of the Paris agreement “to support credible carbon markets which deliver access to international offsets for Australian business”. Herd pointed out that during the last climate change talks in Poland in December last year, that issue “was actually a core priority for Australian negotiators”. The Business Council of Australia and the AiGroup also pointed to their previous statements of support for the use of permits on Thursday. After days of the Coalition bombarding Labor’s climate policy, and in response to claims that business could be forced to spend between $25bn and $35bn on international credits to meet a 45% pollution reduction target, Bill Shorten muscled up on the hustings in Darwin on Thursday. Shorten abandoned the low-key demeanour he has made a study of projecting in the opening week of the campaign, and branded the government’s campaign against Labor’s climate change policies “malicious and stupid”. “It’s a malicious campaign by this government,” the Labor leader said. “What they want to do is scare Australians and say that it’s too hard to take action on climate change. “In climate change, there will never be enough figures to satisfy the climate sceptics. If you don’t believe in the science of climate change, no amount of evidence will ever convince you because, fundamentally, it’s a stupid position not to take action.” Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target of 45% and has signalled business will be permitted to use international permits to help meet its liabilities. Herd told Guardian Australia some of the cost estimates being deployed during the election campaign about permits appeared to be based on the European Unit Allowance, the compliance unit in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. “This is the most expensive reference price you could currently find,” she said. “Project-based international offset credits are usually much cheaper, especially if the company has in place a direct off-take agreement with the project”. She pointed out the local carbon price, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit, was also significantly cheaper than the European allowance price being quoted. “It looks like much of the commentary is potentially conflating the EU compliance price with international offsets, and then using it as a generic carbon price to calculate an inflated total cost of climate action for Australia. This is not helpful for anyone.” While Morrison is now pillorying the use of permits, the Coalition in 2017, when the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was environment minister, took a decision “in principle” to allow the use of foreign carbon credits. When it reviewed its existing suite of climate change policies in late 2017, the government accepted the use of permits and said a final decision “on the timing of use and appropriate quantity and quality limits” would be taken by 2020. On Thursday, on the hustings in Tasmania, Scott Morrison declared Shorten “can’t even tell you how much money that companies are going to have to send offshore”. “The Australian reports today $25bn, we actually think it’s higher than that. I understand it’s around $35bn that they will force companies to send offshore for those foreign carbon credits. “That could be invested here in Australia, in employing more people, increasing wages.” Morrison also appeared to leave open the option the government could consider nuclear energy during a radio interview in Tasmania. He said the government didn’t intend to subsidise nuclear energy but it was “not, not on the agenda”, even though there are legislative bans on nuclear energy. The prime minister suggested the test of whether a project could proceed was whether it could pay its own way, and he said the evidence to date suggested nuclear power was too expensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/feb/24/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-sanctions-russia-invasion-ukraine-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T23:37:01Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson says ‘Putin must fail’ after Cobra meeting – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/feb/24/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-sanctions-russia-invasion-ukraine-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/feb/24/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-sanctions-russia-invasion-ukraine-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson says ‘Putin must fail’ after Cobra meeting – as it happened","bodyText":"You can follow our main blog on the developments in Ukraine here: Boris Johnson told ministers it is “a dark day in the history of our continent” following the invasion of Ukraine during a Cabinet meeting which followed a Cobra meeting. Johnson said Vladimir Putin has launched “a cynical and brutal invasion for his own vainglorious ends”, a No 10 spokesman said. Eleven Labour MPs who signed an open letter from the Stop The War Coalition that criticised Nato have now withdrawn their names. The PA news agency understands they were threatened with the removal of the whip if their names were not taken off the letter. Boris Johnson has signalled that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, could face war crimes charges over the invasion of Ukraine. He told MPs “anyone who sends a Russian into battle to kill innocent Ukrainians” could be brought to court. The prime minister added the UK is working with allies to set up a “particular international war crimes tribunal for those involved in war crimes in the Ukraine theatre”. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and a former energy secretary, has criticised the government for not including the energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft in the sanctions list. The Foreign Office released a statement with more detail of the sanctions package unveiled by the PM. It says the government will: Freeze the assets of all Russian banks including, today, a full asset freeze on VTB, Russia’s largest bank. Co-ordinated with the US this is by far the single biggest financial sanction in history. Individuals and companies whose assets are frozen will be unable to undertake any business in the UK or with UK nationals. Prevent Russian companies from borrowing on the UK markets, effectively ending the ability of those companies closest to Putin to raise finance in the UK. This is in addition to banning the Russian state itself from raising funds in the UK, as previously announced. Here is a selection of some other front pages from Friday’s newspapers. The front page of Friday’s Guardian: Video footage has emerged which appears to show military vehicles at the site of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. Cyber experts have identified a new strain of computer-disabling malware unleashed on Ukrainian targets as part of Russia’s offensive, as the UK government and banks said they were on alert for online attacks. Russia was widely expected to launch a cyber assault alongside its military campaign, and the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine was marked by the deployment of “wiper” malware . A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which paralyses websites by bombarding them with spurious information requests, also hit Ukrainian government sites. On Wednesday, ESET Research Labs, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said it had detected a new piece of data-wiping malware on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. The Cabinet was also briefed by the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee Sir Simon Gass and the Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin. The PM’s spokesman added: “The Prime Minister concluded by saying Putin must fail, and that the UK would work with its allies to achieve the restitution of the sovereignty of Ukraine.” Boris Johnson told ministers it is “a dark day in the history of our continent” following the invasion of Ukraine during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday evening which followed a Cobra meeting. Johnson said Vladimir Putin has launched “a cynical and brutal invasion for his own vainglorious ends”, a No 10 spokesman said. “He said the UK could be proud of the actions it has taken so far, playing a leading role in Nato, developing a tough economic sanctions package together with our allies, and providing lethal defensive weaponry to the Ukrainian government,” he said. “He told Cabinet that the Ukrainian military was fighting back in defiance of Putin’s attempts to subjugate Ukraine. And he pointed to protests within Russia which demonstrated that Putin’s actions would also face resistance from within his own country.” The head of MI6 has said Russia’s attack on Ukraine was a “long planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression”. Richard Moore, known in Whitehall as C, tweeted that “US and UK intelligence communities uncovered Putin’s plans for Ukraine”. He said: “We exposed his attempts to engineer ‘false flag’, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials. The UK must “get personal” and “seize yachts, seize homes” of those linked to Vladimir Putin, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Tom Tugendhat told Channel 4 News. It was in early November that US president Joe Biden took the rare step to dispatch CIA director Bill Burns to Moscow. The spy chief’s message – in part – was to warn his Kremlin counterparts that the West was concerned about unusual troop movements it was seeing near Ukraine’s border. British officials were anxious, too. “We keep on coming back to crises over Ukraine,” one said later that month. “President Biden does not send Bill Burns to Moscow unless he is very worried about something. And so, you know, without being able to go into the full details, there is enough substance to this to make us concerned.” A few days later, in early December, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence had found that the Kremlin was “planning a multi-front offensive as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops”, from the north, east and south. The intelligence warnings continued into January, increasingly to the irritation of Kyiv, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskiy complained that acute tensions with Russia were nothing new. “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said at the time, referring to the start of the 2014 war with Russian-backed separatists. In the Dail on Thursday evening, Ireland’s foreign affairs Minister Simon Coveney confirmed the Irish Embassy is no longer operating in Kyiv, PA reports. “Our staff and other staff are transferring to a safe place as we speak,” he told the Dail. He also provided an update on the plans for a visa waiver scheme for Ukrainian nationals. Coveney said that he was working with the Irish justice minister to “put a structure and system in place that will allow Ukrainian citizens in Ireland bring their families from Ukraine to Ireland, if they judge that that’s necessary for safety reasons”. He said that he will ensure that the “system works and is streamlined”. “Likewise for Irish citizens who are in Ukraine, who of course want to bring their families with them home who may not be Irish nationals, we will also ensure that we have a process in place that will allow them to do that quickly and without impediments,” Coveney added. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified pressure for tougher economic sanctions on Moscow. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was among many to call for Moscow to be shut out of Swift – the world’s main international payments network – with the aim of hitting Russian trade and making it harder for its companies to do business. Ireland will back the “strongest possible and most comprehensive” package of sanctions against Russia to punish the country for its invasion of Ukraine, the taoiseach said. Micheál Martin said the punitive measures would reflect the “grave nature” of the assault on the Ukrainian people. Speaking ahead of the summit of EU leaders, Martin said he would support sanctions in the financial, energy and transport sectors that would help “weaken the industrial base of Russia” and its capacity to wage a war. EU leaders are meeting on Thursday evening to discuss and agree on a range of sanctions against Moscow, PA reports. Minutes after Vladimir Putin ended weeks of speculation by announcing a “special military operation” at dawn on Thursday, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities including the capital Kyiv. CNN’s Matthew Chance was filmed reporting live from an airbase on the outskirts of Kyiv, where Russian airborne troops engaged in a firefight with the Ukrainian military. Responding to the shadow chief whip’s letter to Labour MPs today (see 7.18pm), Andrew Scattergood, co-chair of Momentum, said: “These MPs’ steadfast commitment to the Ukrainian people and against Russia’s invasion is beyond question. “Indeed, many of them have led the criticism of Putin’s act of aggression today, forcefully and without reservation. “It beggars belief that the Labour leadership instead focuses on a week-old statement in an attempt to wage factional warfare against them, while a real war wages on against the Ukrainian people.” The Russian people “don’t deserve” President Vladimir Putin as their leader, peers have heard. Labour’s Lord Robertson of Port Ellen said: “I am sure I wasn’t the only one who woke up this morning to listen to the news who wasn’t reminded of that day, that similar day in 1968, when we woke up to hear the news that Soviet tanks had crushed out the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. The former Nato secretary-general added: “In May of 2002 when I chaired the Nato-Russia summit with President Putin as an equal member around that table I thought that finally I had exorcised the ghosts of 1968. I stood only hours later on a platform at the press conference standing beside President Putin when he said these words - ‘Ukraine is an independent sovereign nation state and it will choose its own path to peace and security’. Now remarkably the same man says that Ukraine does not exist, it is a state that does not deserve to be a state, that it’s democracy will be crushed again.” Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing or preparing to flee the country after Russian leader Vladimir Putin began an invasion. Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as numbers of people on foot near the southern and western borders while reports of casualties mount. Conservative former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick urged Johnson to place sanctions on all the remaining Russian banks as well as the executives associated with them. He said: “Can I encourage my right honourable friend to sanction all the remaining Russian banks, to sanction the executives associated with them? I noticed that many are resigning today. “To publish a further list of individuals resident in this country or otherwise to be sanctioned. “And to redouble his excellent efforts to suspend Russia from Swift as the single most effective immediate step that the West could do to put pressure on Vladimir Putin.” The PM responded that “the programme he set out, the sanctions, is exactly the right one and the one the government is following”. Conservative MP Richard Drax (South Dorset) asked Boris Johnson to reassure Nato members that if a Russian boot lands on Nato soil “military force will be met by military force”, PA reports. Johnson replied: “What is so encouraging is that the whole House understands the vital importance of that Article 5 guarantee that we make to every one of the 30 members of Nato.” Military helicopters, apparently Russian, were filmed flying over the Dnieper River on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they were met by Ukrainian counter-fire. An ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase on the outskirts of Kyiv was also recorded. Russian forces have attacked Ukraine by land, sea, and air on a massive scale, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war Eleven Labour MPs who signed an open letter from the Stop The War Coalition that criticised Nato have now withdrawn their names. The PA news agency understands they were threatened with the removal of the whip if their names were not taken off the letter. (see 6pm) A Labour spokesperson said: “The small number of Labour MPs that signed the Stop The War statement have all now withdrawn their names. “This shows Labour is under new management. “With Keir Starmer’s leadership there will never be any confusion about whose side Labour is on – Britain, Nato, freedom and democracy – and every Labour MP now understands that.” Vladimir Putin must be brought to a court of law and end his days in prison, Labour MP Chris Bryant (Rhondda) said. Bryant told the Commons: “The prime minister is absolutely right, we equivocated shamelessly after Crimea. We were spineless. We must not be spineless now because what will inevitably happen is either the Baltic states, or one of the members of Nato, or perhaps Sweden or Finland will feel the wrath of Putin next and that will mean British action.” Boris Johnson replied: “I think one of the most fascinating things about what Putin is doing is how close an analogy there is between his actions and those of Slobodan Milosevic. “Exactly the same nonsense being peddled about the mystical union between Kosovo and Belgrade, between Kyiv and Moscow, exactly the same aggression and remember that Slobodan Milošević died on trial.” The PM suggested Russia attacking a Nato country is an “appalling possibility” and said the UK would come to the defence of Nato allies if attacked. Labour MP Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) welcomed the sanctions, but said “the record of driving out dictators and demagogues with sanctions isn’t always that successful”. He also said he has a “concern” that President Vladimir Putin “might not stop at Ukraine, he might go into a Nato country” and said “many of us think that might be the next step”. Boris Johnson said Sheerman was “absolutely right to raise that appalling possibility” and said “it is vital that we reaffirm again that under Article 5 of the Nato treaty we stand foursquare behind every one of our Nato allies and will come to their defence”. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle called the Russian government the “fascist imperialist Putin regime”, while the prime minister said he wants to keep embassy staff in Moscow. Russell-Moyle said there are “protests in a number of Russian cities” and celebrities there have been speaking out, PA reports. “I do hope that we will be offering all the support that we can to those people who are likely to be shunned by the fascist imperialist Putin regime,” he said. Boris Johnson replied: “Yes.” He said one of the reasons he wants to keep embassy staff in Moscow “even though the temptation is there simply to sunder diplomatic relations with Putin, I want to keep them there to support groups such as the ones he mentions”. Boris Johnson has signalled that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, could face war crimes charges over the invasion of Ukraine. He told MPs “anyone who sends a Russian into battle to kill innocent Ukrainians” could be brought to court. The prime minister added the UK is working with allies to set up a “particular international war crimes tribunal for those involved in war crimes in the Ukraine theatre”. Speaking in the House of Commons, former United Nations commander Bob Stewart said he had given evidence for war crimes trials including where people were charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. The Conservative MP for Beckenham said: “Could I ask (Mr Johnson) and the House to agree with me that any Russian who kills a Ukrainian must remember that one day they may well be brought to court for crimes against humanity or genocide?” Johnson replied: “Yes, and not just any Russian combatant but anyone who sends a Russian into battle to kill innocent Ukrainians.” A former head of the British army, Peter Wall, believes the west have been “complacent” over Russia and should have “realised the importance of deterrents”. The former chief of the general staff was asked by Times Radio whether Nato had been complacent towards Putin in recent years. Wall said: “I’m afraid I have to say I think we have, and I think that’s been called out today. “And there are a number of us from my generation, who were very reluctant to see the reduction in UK forces that’s happened. “As you know, our capabilities have haemorrhaged really since 2010. “And I think that not only do we lack the resilience of capability that we would have liked, but actually the message we’ve been sending, subliminally, has been one of complacency and a failure to realise the importance of deterrents.” He also warned it “won’t be very long” until Russian troops overwhelm Kyiv. Boris Johnson told the Commons that relatives of targets of sanctions will also be sanctioned. Labour MP Kevan Jones (North Durham) asked for an assurance that “sanctions that are going to target individuals will also target relatives and connected parties”, PA reports. He mentioned the Economic Crime Bill, the review of the Official Secrets Act, and the Foreign Registration Act, and asked “why can’t we bring them forward and do them now? They would get huge support and we’ve been waiting for some of these for nearly two years”. Johnson said: “We will certainly be making sure that we are able to sanction and do sanction relatives and other interested parties, and there will be a rolling programme of intensifying sanctions. Labour chair of the international development committee, Sarah Champion, pressed the prime minister on the prospect of a Russian invasion triggering a “significant refugee crisis in Europe”, PA reports. The MP for Rotherham said: “Let us be under no illusion. We are on the brink of a potentially enormous humanitarian crisis that could see massive loss of life and widespread suffering to the Ukrainian people and all to suffer the warped desire complex of the Russian president. The attack on Ukraine is also likely to cause mass displacement of people, potentially triggering a significant refugee crisis in Europe. “So can the prime minister tell us what he is doing to support the Ukrainian people who stay and those who choose to flee?” Johnson replied: “She makes a very important point and I’m grateful because the humanitarian impact threatens to be enormous and that’s why I’ve said what I’ve said about supporting those refugees as they come out of Ukraine. “But we’ve got to make sure that we do everything we can to stabilise the Ukrainian economy, to support the government as far as we possibly can. Our friends and allies are working with us to do much more.” According to Sienna Rodgers at LabourList, all the Labour MPs who signed the Stop the War anti-Nato statement have now withdrawn their names from it. They had been told they faced losing the whip if they didn’t. (See 6pm.) That is all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. Back in the Commons Peter Bone (Con) asks if the PM is keeping open the option of Nato imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He says he thinks that is what Johnson was saying in his earlier answer. (See 5.55pm.) He says this is what the Ukrainians are calling for. (See 4.47pm.) Johnson says he is trying to keep all options open. But he says that some ideas are “more practical than others” and he says it is necessary to have a “dose of realism” about what can be done on the military front. That’s an even stronger hint than he gave to Sir Iain Duncan Smith that he does not see this as a realistic option. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and a former energy secretary, has criticised the government for not including the energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft in the sanctions list. He said: The absence of Gazprom and Rosneft, part-owned by BP, in today’s sanctions list is the elephant in the room. The UK must do everything we can to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned oil and gas giants stand to profit from this war and soaring prices. We must start treating Putin’s Russia like the rogue state it is and immediately cut off UK investment in these firms. The Foreign Office has now released a statement with more detail of the sanctions package unveiled by the PM. This is what it says about the financial and trade measures being enacted. It says the government will: Freeze the assets of all Russian banks including, today, a full asset freeze on VTB, Russia’s largest bank. Co-ordinated with the US this is by far the single biggest financial sanction in history. Individuals and companies whose assets are frozen will be unable to undertake any business in the UK or with UK nationals. Prevent Russian companies from borrowing on the UK markets, effectively ending the ability of those companies closest to Putin to raise finance in the UK. This is in addition to banning the Russian state itself from raising funds in the UK, as previously announced. Take a power to prevent designated banks from accessing Sterling and clearing payments through the UK. This will match the power the US already has. Banks subject to this measure will be unable to process any payments through the UK or have access to UK financial markets. Ban the export of a range of high-end and critical technical equipment and components in sectors including electronics, telecommunications, and aerospace. Aligned with the US, EU and other partners, these trade sanctions will constrain the development of Russian’s military-industrial and technological development for years to come. This is what it says about some of the individuals who have sanctions placed on them. Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire and previously married to Putin’s daughter Katarina Petr Fradkov, head of the recently sanctioned Promsvyazbank and son of the former head of Russian Foreign Intelligence (FSB). Promsvyazbank was designated on February 2022 and services 70% of state contracts by the Russian Defence Ministry. Denis Bortnikov, deputy president of Russia’s largest bank VTB. Bortnikov is the son of Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) which was responsible for the poisoning of political activist Alexey Navalny in August 2020 with a banned chemical agent from the novichok group. Yury Slyusar, director of United Aircraft Corporation, a major aircraft manufacturer for the Russian military., Elena Aleksandrovna Georgieva, chair of the board of Novikombank, a state-owned defence conglomerate. These individuals, and others being sanctioned, will be unable to travel to the UK, and will have their assets in the UK frozen. And this is what it says about the five major defence companies being sanctioned. Rostec – Russia’s largest defence company. We now sanction the vast majority of the Russian defence sector. Rostec is a major arms exporter ($13bn military exports in 2020). Uralvagonzavod - The world’s largest tank manufacturer, affiliated with Rostec, which makes more tanks than any other company on the globe. Tactical Missile Corporation - A major supplier of air and seaborne missiles, which played a key role in rearming and upgrading Russian coastal defences including support to recent Russian military build-up. United Aircraft Corporation - A holding company that includes all major Russian aircraft manufacturers, including MiG &amp; Sukhoi. It supplies key Russian military aircraft used as part of Russia’s military build-up. United Shipbuilding Corporation – The largest shipbuilding company in Russia. It constructed a number of the key Russian warships, including three Ivan Gren-Class Landing Ships that redeployed to the Black Sea earlier in February 2022. In total 120 Russian oligarchs and businesses are being subject to sanctions. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson’s statement to MPs explaining new new sanctions being imposed on Russia. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has confirmed that Russian airlines have been banned from entering British airspace or landing in this country. According to the i’s Paul Waugh, the 11 Labour MPs who signed the anti-Nato Stop the War statement are being told to withdraw their names or face the loss of the party whip. The party has not confirmed this officially, although sources are not denying what Waugh has reported. The text of the Stop the War statement is here. And here is an extract. Our focus is on the policies of the British government which have poured oil on the fire throughout this episode. In taking this position we do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes. The British government has talked up the threat of war continually, to the point where the Ukraine government has asked it to stop. Unlike the French and German governments, it has advanced no proposals for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, and has contributed only sabre-rattling ... The British government has sent arms to Ukraine and deployed further troops to Eastern Europe, moves which serve no purpose other than inflaming tensions and indicating disdain for Russian concerns. It has also declared that Ukraine has a “sovereign right” to join Nato, when no such right exists to join it or any other military alliance ... We refute the idea that Nato is a defensive alliance, and believe its record in Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya over the last generation, not to mention the US-British attack on Iraq, clearly proves otherwise. And here is the list of MPs who have signed it: Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Richard Burgon, Ian Lavery, Beth Winter; Zarah Sultana, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Apsana Begum, Mick Whitley, Tahir Ali, Claudia Webbe; and Ian Mearns. They are all Labour MPs apart from Corbyn, who has had the whip suspended, and Webbe, who was expelled from the party following her conviction for harassment. UPDATE: This is from ITV’s Anushka Asthana. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, asks Johnson whether he will consider the case for getting Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Johnson says he “understands the attractions of a no-fly zone”, and remembers how one was imposed over northern Iraq in 1991. But he says that imposing one over Ukraine could mean “we would face the risk of having to shoot down Russian planes” and that is something MPs “would want to contemplate with caution”. David Davis (Con) asks Johnson is those Russians subject to sanctions will face criminal action if they travel abroad. Johnson confirms that that is what will happen. What is most interesting, though, about Davis’s intervention is that he chose not to make the case for the UK providing air support for the Ukrainian army. Davis proposed this on Twitter this morning (see 10.40am), but perhaps he did not argue for it this afternoon because he has concluded that it has no realistic chance of being adopted. Back in the Commons Clive Lewis (Lab) asks the PM if he agrees that there should be a negotiated solution to the conflict, not a military solution. Johnson says Putin had the chance for a negotiated solution and did not take it. He says that puts the world on a “very, very different course”. Alex Salmond has cancelled his controversial chat show on the Kremlin-funded channel RT after facing intense political and public pressure to do so following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The former first minister of Scotland came under heavy attack yesterday after Vladimir Putin announced Russia had formally recognised two breakaway provinces in eastern Ukraine, as a prelude to Thursday’s morning military assaults across the country. Salmond said his firm Slàinte Media, run with another former SNP MP, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, would be suspended until further notice. The latest edition of the Alex Salmond Show was screened by RT on Thursday morning, hours after Russia attacked Ukrainian cities, and remains online. Salmond said: We now have the worst of all fears – a hot war in Europe. The efforts of every single person should be to re-establish the peace. That certainly is our focus, and therefore Slàinte Media have decided to suspend the Alex Salmond Show until that can be secured. There is no productive point in having the future of a television show dominate prime minister’s questions as it did yesterday, when politicians should be rising to the occasion of the great issues of peace in Europe. Salmond also accused his critics of hypocrisy, claiming the controversy had seen Ahmed-Sheikh subjected to “a crescendo of personal abuse and harassment” which led her to fear for her safety. He insisted his show was entirely free of Russian influence. “They have kept entirely to their commitments on this in line with the Ofcom code,” he said. In the Commons, in response to a question from Julian Lewis (Con), Johnson suggested Britain would be willing to give sanctuary to a Ukrainian government in exile. Lewis said that Britain had hosted government-in-exile from the Baltic states under Soviet occupation. Would the UK does this again? Johnson said Britain was willing to offer Ukraine the support it needed, and he said that when he spoke to President Zelenskiy this morning he spoke to him about how it might be necessary for him to find a safe space. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said in his response to the PM that Putin should pay a “massive price” for the invasion. He said: What we are witnessing is a full-scale invasion, it is an act of war. This is first and foremost an unprovoked attack on the peace and innocence of Ukraine and its people. But it is equally an attack on international law, an attack on European democracy and an attack on the peace our continent so carefully built over the last 75 years. President Putin - and President Putin alone - bears responsibility for these horrific acts. And it is he, and his Kremlin cabal, who must now pay a massive price for their actions. It is important to say to the Russian people that we know Putin is not acting in their name. He is a dictator, he is an imperialist, he is a tyrant. He is as much a threat to his own people, as he is to us all. Back in the Commons Theresa May, the former PM, said that Putin had turned his country into a pariah state and that Russia should be made to feel “the cold wind of isolation”. In his statement to MPs Boris Johnson said he would be discussing with allies the case for excluding Russia from the Swift international payments system. (See 4.03pm.) My colleague Jessica Elgot says that at this stage Johnson is not optimistic about getting his allies to support the proposal. In his response to Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer echoed many of the points he made in his TV address earlier. (See 2.54pm.) Here is an extract from his Commons statement. The consequences of Putin’s actions will be felt throughout the world. For years and I fear decades to come. Russia’s democratic neighbours and every other democracy that lives in the shadow of autocratic power are watching their worst nightmare unfold. So all those who believe in democracy, over dictatorship, in the rule of law, over the reign of terror, in freedom, over the jackboot of tyranny, must unite and take a stand. We must support the Ukrainian people in their fight and we must ensure Putin fails. Putin will eventually learn the same lesson that Europe’s tyrants learnt in the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines, that people’s desire for freedom burns brighter than he can ever extinguish, that the light of liberty will prevail over his darkness. The UK will impose its “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, including pushing to end Russia’s use of the Swift international payment system, freezing assets of all major Russian banks, limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks and placing sanctions on more than 100 individuals and entities. Boris Johnson has urged European leaders to agree that Russia’s use of the major payments system should be suspended, making the argument in a call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and in a meeting of G7 leaders. The move is likely to be resisted by EU countries. Announcing a package of sanctions which Johnson had promised would “hobble” Russia’s economy, the UK said it would said legislation would be laid on Tuesday to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Russia raising sovereign debt on UK markets. The sanctions include more key oligarchs who will have assets frozen, though sources said that more names – including what they said would be more recognisable figures – would be released in the coming weeks. The prime minister announced 10 measures the UK was taking immediately. The UK will freeze assets of all major Russian banks including VTB, the country’s second largest bank with assets totalling £154bn. Individual sanctions will be imposed on over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, including Rostec, the country’s biggest defence company, employing more than two million people and exporting £10bn in arms a year, as well as four other defence companies. Oligarchs who will face sanctions include Putin’s former son-in-law Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire, Denis Bortnikov, deputy president and chairman of the state-run VTB Bank’s management board, Yury Slyusar, director of the United Aircraft Corporation. The Russian airline Aeroflot will be banned from landing in the UK. The UK will suspend and prohibit all dual-use export licences to Russia, which covers items that could have civilian or military use. There will also be legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports to Russia, including semi-conductors, aircraft parts such as Rolls Royce jet engines, and oil refinery equipment. No 10 said it would set out more detail in the coming days about new legislation to limit the deposits that all Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts, intended to choke off the ability of Russians to raise finance and keep their money in London. No 10 also said it would extend a full range of measures to Belarus, which Russian forces have used to invade Ukraine, treating the country as subject to same sanctions regime as Russia. The final measure was a pledge to bring forward the Economic Crime bill, before Easter recess, aimed at making assets more transparent. Johnson says Russian stocks are down by as much as 45% today. And the rouble has hit new lows against the dollar, he says. He says the UK will counter the Russian disinformation. He says he has called a meeting of Nato leaders that is taking place tomorrow. And he ends with a message to the Russian and Ukrainian people. I say to the people of Russia again, whose president has just authorised an onslaught against a fellow Slavic people, I cannot believe that this horror is being done in your name, or that you really want the pariah status that these actions will bring to the Putin regime. And to our Ukrainian friends, in this moment of agony, I say that we are with you and we are on your side. Your right to choose your own destiny is a right that the United Kingdom and our allies will always defend. Johnson says the UK is announcing the largest package of sanctions that Russia has ever seen. A full asset freeze is being imposed on VBT, Russia’s second largest bank. Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system, he says. Russsian state and private companies will be banned from raising money in the UK. The amount of money Russians can have in British bank accounts will be limited. Sanctions will apply to Belarus too, Johnson says. He says Aeroflot will be banned in the UK. Export controls will be implemented, similar to the ones imposed by the US. (That means a ban on items like semiconductor and other hi-tech equipment.) There will also be a ban on the export of dual-use items to Russia. (That means equipment that could be used militarily.) Legislation to enforce some of these sanctions will be laid in parliament next week, he says. These trade sanctions will constrain Russia’s military, industrial and technological capabilities for years to come. Johnson also says he is discussing with allies the possibility of excluding Russia from the Swift international payments system. Johnson says President Putin will stand condemned by history. Putin will stand condemned in the eyes of the world and the history. He will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands and although the UK and our allies tried every avenue for diplomacy until the final [moment], I’m driven to conclude the Putin was always determined to attack his neighbour, no matter what we did. Now we see him for what he is - a bloodstained aggressor, who believes in imperial conquest. Boris Johnson starts by saying he has just come from a G7 meeting, which was also attended by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. He says the Ukrainians are offering a “fierce defence” of their country. Boris Johnson is about to make a statement to MPs about the Russian invastion of Ukraine. He is expected to focus on the beefed-up sanctions being imposed by the UK in response. Some sanctions were imposed on Tuesday, but those were very limited, and at the time Johnson insisted that more would follow in the event of President Putin launching a full-scale invasion. Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, has called for a no-fly zone to be put in place over his country. Speaking to journalists, he said the country wanted “something which only Nato can provide” and that was a no-fly zone over the country. As PA Media reports, Prystaiko also said anti-tank weapons supplied by the UK had been used against Russian tanks today as he called on Nato to send troops into Ukraine. He said “we should have started much earlier, maybe decades ago” to prepare for Russian aggression. He went on: That’s why we’ve been trying to get into Nato [for] all these years. Because we always believed this would come. The Ministry of Defence has delivered an update on developments in Ukraine. The MoD has also called in the Russian military attache to express the government’s opposition to the invasion. Here is the text of the statement issued by G7 leaders after their virtual meeting this afternoon. The G7 countries are: the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg According to a report in the Financial Times, Boris Johnson is pushing for Russia to be excluded from the Swift international payments system – a key Ukrainian demand, see 3.52pm – but meeting resistance from other countries, and particularly the EU. The FT (paywall) says: Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, is pushing “very hard” for Russia to be ejected from the Swift international payments system, a move that would deliver a heavy blow to the country’s banks and its ability to trade beyond its borders. However, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, warned Johnson on Thursday that his country would not support such a dramatic move and neither would the EU, according to officials close to sanctions negotiations. A German official declined to comment, saying only that “all options are still on the table”. My colleague Jessica Elgot says No 10 sources are confirming that Johnson pushed for Russia to be excluded from Swift in the virtual G7 leaders’ meeting that has been taking place this afternoon. As is often the case, the No 10 readout of the Johnson/Scholz call earlier makes a lot more once sense the context has been explained. This is what a No 10 spokesperson said about the exchange. The prime minister said that President Putin must fail and achieving that will require the western world to isolate him both politically and economically. The prime minister welcomed Germany’s decision to suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline but said that allies must now make a concerted effort to bring the strongest possible sanctions to bear on the Putin regime. The prime minister underscored that western inaction or underreaction would have unthinkable consequences. The leaders agreed to stay in close contact and to discuss our response further in this afternoon’s meeting of G7 leaders. The Ukrainian embassy in London has produced a list of sanctions that it wants the UK and other countries to impose on Russia, ITV’s Shebab Khan reports. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, has been reinforcing one of these points on Twitter. In his Mais lecture Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, argued that Britain has to have a strong economy to be able to defend its values around the world. He said: Hope and opportunity should not just be the preserve of the citizens of the United Kingdom. As the situation develops in Ukraine, this moment reveals something about the UK’s global role. The basis of our influence in the world and ability to be a force for good is going to be in large part based on the strength of our economy. That economic strength gives us the resources to both invest more in defence and come to the aid of countries that need our assistance. It gives us the ability to increase the security of our energy supply, it gives us the diplomatic power to shape the rules of the international order, and when countries breach those rules: the weight to impose meaningful sanctions. No nation has the right to lead, to a seat at the top table. It must be earned. The full text of the speech is here. As my colleague Phillip Inman reports, Sunak was using his speech to stress his commitment to low taxes. But he also took a swipe at the “Laffer curve” Tories who argue that tax cuts frequently pay for themselves because they lead to the Treasury collecting more in revenue. (It is almost always Tories who make this argument, which is particularly popular with the rightwing commentariat.) Sunak said: I firmly believe in lower taxes. The most powerful case for the dynamic market economy is that it brings economic freedom and prosperity. And the best expression of that freedom is for all of us to be able to make decisions about how to save, invest or use the money we earn. The marginal pound our country produces is far better spent by individuals and businesses than government. So I am disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that ‘tax cuts always pay for themselves’. They do not. Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere. And it is hard to cut taxes at a time when demands on the state are growing. A fiery meeting between the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, broke down after just a matter of minutes, the Guardian has been told. After Kelin was summoned to Whitehall in light of the invasion of Ukraine, a Foreign Office source said he had “spouted the usual propaganda” but that Truss was “having none of it”. The exchange was heated and sharp, the source said, with Truss telling Kelin he “should be ashamed of himself” and insisting that the rest of the world would “rally around Ukraine”, while Russia had turned itself into “an international pariah”. “Liz ended the meeting early and kicked him out,” the source added. Truss will spend the rest of the day speaking to other countries’ foreign ministers. If it had not been for the invasion of Ukraine, today’s political news would have been dominated by the changes to post-18 education announced today. As Sally Weale reports in her preview, the government is asking students to start paying off student debt earlier (when their salaries reach a lower threshold) and for longer (remaining debts will be written off after 40 years, not 30 years as now). The official Department for Education news release about the plans is here. The DfE has also released two consultation documents: on access to university, to discourage students from taking poor quality courses that will bring them little benefit; and on plans for a lifelong loan entitlement, to pay for retraining. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published an analysis of the impact of the new student loan repayment rules. It says that students who go on to become high earners will gain from the changes while students who become low earners will lose, and that men will gain from the changes on average, while women will lose. It says: As a percentage of lifetime earnings, the reform affects borrowers with lower middling earnings the most (yellow line). For them, the reform translates into a lifetime earnings loss of more than 1%, or more than a penny in each pound they will ever earn. However, these lower middling earners will still pay back around £9,000 less on average than the highest earners, so their student loans will still be subsidised by the taxpayer. Their losses relative to the current system arise because the taxpayer subsidy for these graduates will be substantially smaller under the new system than it is under the current system. The reform package also entails substantial redistribution across genders: men stand to gain on average, whereas women are set to lose. On average, men will repay around £5,500 less towards their student loans under the new system, whereas women will pay £6,600 more. This is because women tend to spend more time out of work than men and on average earn less than men even when in work. As a result, men are much more likely to pay off their loans and benefit from lower interest rates. Downing Street has said the UK is increasing its “air policing contribution” to Nato. The PM’s spokesman said: We are increasing our air policing contribution to Nato from RAF Akrotiri and the UK to help protect our Nato allies. So, two typhoons and a voyager for refuelling from the UK will support continuous Nato air policing over Poland’s border with Ukraine ... two typhoons and a voyager for refuelling from Akrotiri [will] also support continuous Nato air policing over Romania’s border with Ukraine. So, this is a defensive capability designed to protect the airspace of our Nato allies ... they will not operate in Ukrainian or Russian airspace. Just to emphasise, this isn’t additional air support, this is the air support already committed to Nato doing additional activities. In his own televised address Keir Starmer has called for an entirely new approach to dealing with President Putin following his invasion of Ukraine. Starmer said: We must make a clean break with the failed approach to handling Putin, which after Georgia, Crimea and Donbas fed his belief that the benefits of aggression outweigh the cost. We must finally show him he is wrong. That means doing all we can to help Ukraine defend herself, urgently reinforcing and reassuring our Nato allies in eastern Europe and the hardest possible sanctions must be taken against the Putin regime. It must be isolated, its finances frozen, its ability to function crippled ... This must be a turning point in our history. We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. He seeks division, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but only if we stand together. Unlike Boris Johnson in his TV address (see 1.03pm), Starmer also insisted that the war would create “economic pain” for people in Britain. He said: We must prepare ourselves for difficulties here. We will see economic pain as we free Europe from dependence on Russian gas and clean our institutions from money stolen from the Russian people. But the British public have always been willing to make sacrifice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again. Boris Johnson has today spoken to Jonas Støre, the Norwegian prime minister, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor. According to No 10, Johnson told Støre that “the full and violent invasion of Ukraine we have witnessed signalled a dark time for Europe and a disaster for the world”. And in his call with Scholz Johnson described the invasion as “the most horrific act of aggression in his political lifetime”. In both calls Johnson and his counterparts also stressed the need for a coordinated approach to imposing strong sanctions on Russia. Western officials believe Russian ground forces could attack Kyiv with indiscriminate force. Kyiv has been a central part of the Russian planning process and must be taken if the Kremlin is to achieve its objectives, they say. With Ukrainian resistance, it may well be that Russia has to put troops into the city in order to be able to take the city, according to this assessment. If that is the case, then we can expect that to be a particularly difficult and challenging environment both for those that are defending and potentially for those that are attempting to assault the city as well. Officials are particularly concerned about Russia’s ability to use overwhelming firepower, including in built-up areas, which it has shown that it is willing to do in order to achieve its objectives. They believe it could mean a large number of civilian casualties with an indiscriminate use of military force, which has been seen in previous conflicts. Russian forces in Belarus are equipped with a very large number of support helicopters - a separate guards land airborne division - and they were specifically designed in order to conduct those sorts of heliwar assault activities, officials say. They also point out that Russia has a marked advantage given its precision munitions, its airforce and its artillery. There are significant numbers of troops on the border which have not yet moved into Ukraine. And the Russian armed forces have been active in military operations very recently, in Georgia, in Ukraine in 2014 and in Syria, meaning they are battle-hardened. Cyber attacks took place last night, aimed at Ukrainian financial institutions and some other elements of Ukrainian government, the officials say. They believe that President Putin may meet more resistance both in Ukraine and within government than he has anticipated, and that there are significant people within the Russian establishment who think this is a mistake. Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch and Chelsea FC owner, should have his assets in the UK seized, MPs have been told. Speaking during business questions in the Commons, the Labour MP Chris Bryant said: I have got hold of a leaked document from 2019 from the Home Office which says in relation to Mr Abramovich - ‘As part of HMG’s Russia strategy aimed at targeting illicit finance and malign activity, Abramovich remains of interest to HMG due to his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices. An example of this is Abramovich admitting in court proceedings that he paid for political influence. Therefore HMG is focused on ensuring individuals linked to illicit finance and malign activity are unable to base themselves in the UK and will use the relevant tools at its disposal, including immigration powers to prevent this.’ That is nearly three years ago and yet remarkably little has been done in relation. Surely Mr Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country? Surely we should be looking at seizing some of his assets including his £152m home? And making sure that other people who have had tier 1 visas like this are not engaged in malign activity? In reply Mark Spencer, the leader of the Commons, said that the government would be taking “very strong action against high-profile Russian individuals who are of concern” and Bryant could raise his concerns directly with the home secretary during Home Office questions in the Commons next week. Yesterday Boris Johnson published a clarification admitted that he was wrong to tell the Commons on Tuesday that Abramovich was already subjec to sanctions. Asked about Bryant’s claims, the PM’s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing: “I couldn’t comment on individuals in that way or on leaked documents of that type.” At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesman was asked what Boris Johnson meant in his speech earlier when he talked about President Putin being defeated “militarily”. Johnson said: Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure. Asked was what meant by “militarily” in this context, the spokesman said: He’s making the point that ... Our expectation is that the Ukrainian people will fight, will engage with Russian forces ... We are providing military, defensive military capability. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, has become the latest person in the party to criticise Vince Cable, the former party leader, for giving an interview to RT, the pro-Kremlin Russian news channel. (See 11.56am.) Cole-Hamilton said: Vince Cable is a private citizen and no longer a Lib Dem parliamentarian, but his appearance on Salmond’s RT show this morning was entirely wrong. So too is Salmond’s continued association with this agent of a hostile power. No elected Scottish Liberal Democrat will appear on RT. Cable’s appearance is particularly embarrassing for the Lib Dems because Cole-Hamilton had called for Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, to be expelled from the privy council because he hosts a show on RT. Cable appeared to promote his book Money &amp; Power, but also to discuss speculation about a future Labour-Lib Dem pact at Westminster. In a statement Cable said he had “nothing to do” with the Ukraine crisis but said he had urged RT to take his interview off air given Russia’s invasion. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said the new sanctions being imposed on Russia will be “significant”. Delivering the Mais lecture in London, he said: The whole world is rightly appalled at Russia’s aggression. When the freedom of one democratic nation is threatened, wherever they may be in the world, democracy everywhere is challenged. We must apply severe economic costs to these actions and you can expect significant further sanctions to be brought forward. The Ministry of Defence in the UK has issued this update on what is happening in Ukraine. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and Brexit party leader, was telling viewers on his GB News show earlier this month that he thought Vladmir Putin did not want to invade Ukraine. Now Farage says that he is wrong - although he is still blaming the EU. Nicola Sturgeon has led unanimous condemnation by Scotland’s political leaders of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the first minister calling for severe consequences against Vladimir Putin through sweeping sanctions and a crack-down on dirty money in the City of London. “I wanted to condemn in the strongest possible terms the unprovoked imperialist aggression of Vladimir Putin,” she told MSPs in a statement before first minister’s questions. “We must all stand ready to offer refuge and sanctuary where necessary for those who may be displaced.” Her remarks were endorsed by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens and a junior minister, and Alex Cole-Hamilton, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The world was now a “far darker and more unstable place”, Ross said. Sarwar said Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustifiable” attack on Ukraine had to be resisted. “Peace and democracy must prevail and we will not bend to Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions.” Urgent humanitarian support for Ukraine was vital, as was military support for the UK’s Nato allies, he said. Boris Johnson used his TV address to the nation to eloquently express his outrage at the invasion of Ukraine, and his faith that in time democracy and freedom will prevail. “I don’t believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free,” he said, in Churchillian tones. It is what you would expect, and these are words that almost all British politicians would endorse. But was there anything else we gleaned from his comments? Here are takeaways. 1) Johnson has committed himself to the defeat of President Putin. “This hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” he said. This sounds like rhetoric, but it is an important policy objective. 2) But Johnson also implied that he expected the defeat of Putin to take a long time. There were a couple of points in the speech where he made this apparent. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure ... We will work with them – for however long it takes – to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored. He seemed to be implying that it could take years, rather than weeks, for this to be resolved. 3) Johnson seems to have no intention of letting the UK response go beyond sanctions. The new measures would “hobble the Russian economy”, he said. But that won’t necessarily bring down President Putin (sanctions were applied against Iraq for more than a decade without leading to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein) and Johnson did not say they would. This helps to explain why he implied the crisis would not be over soon. Although he set the defeat of Putin as an end, he did not say clearly how this would be achieved - beyond hinting that it was up to the Ukrainians to see off the Russians. Johnson did not refer to British military intervention, but there was nothing in what he said to suggest that he is minded to back the ideas promoted by some of his MPs. (See 10.40am and 11.41am.) 4) Johnson was not willing acknowledge the negative impact the war is likely to have on people in Britain. This morning Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs committee, said costs for consumers in this country would go up. (See 9.27am.) Even though the UK only gets a tiny proportion of its gas from Russia, sanctions are likely to lead to gas supplies to Europe being reduced, and it is hard to see how this would not have a knock-on effect on prices for the UK. As Tugendhat argued, the supply of other goods is likely to be affected too. But rather than acknowledge that Britons will pay a cost, Johnson just said: “We will of course do everything to keep our country safe.” Here is the full text of Boris Johnson’s TV statement. Shortly after 4 o’ clock this morning I spoke to President Zelenskiy of Ukraine to offer the continued support of the UK because our worst fears have now come true and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate. President Putin of Russia has unleashed war in our European continent. He has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse. Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population A vast invasion is under way by land by sea and by air. And this is not, in the infamous phrase, some faraway country of which we know little. We have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We – and the world – cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot, and will not, just look away. It is because we have been so alarmed in recent months at the Russian intimidation that the UK became one of the first countries in Europe to send defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians. Other allies have now done the same and we will do what more we can in the days ahead. Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics. Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure. And so I say to the people of Russia, whose president has just authorised a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people, the parents of Russian soldiers who will lose their lives. I cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime. And I say to the Ukrainians – in this moment of agony we are with you we are praying for you and your families and we are on your side. And if the months ahead are grim, and the flame of freedom burns low, I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine because, for all his bombs and tanks and missiles, I don’t believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free. And I say to the British people, and all who have heard the threats from Putin against those who stand with Ukraine, we will of course do everything to keep our country safe. We are joined in our outrage by friends and allies around the world. We will work with them – for however long it takes – to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored because this act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine. It is an attack on democracy and freedom in east Europe and around the world. This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future and that is a right that the UK will always defend. Johnson says the UK will respond with “a massive package of sanctions” that will “hobble the Russian economy”. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away ... Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end, we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics. Our mission is clear; diplomatically politically, economically, and eventually, military, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says he spoke to the President of Ukraine shortly after 4am. “All our warnings have proved tragically accurate,” he says. President Putin of Russia has unleashed war in our European continent. He’s attacked a friendly country without any provocation, and without any credible excuse. Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population ... A vast invasion is underway, by land, by sea or by air and this is not, in the infamous phrase, some faraway country of which we know nothing. We have Ukrainian friends in this country, neighbours, co-workers. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy, and the right to choose its own destiny. We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away. Vince Cable has been condemned by the Liberal Democrats for appearing on the Russian TV station RT on Thursday, the morning that Russia fully invaded Ukraine. The former Lib Dem leader and ex-business secretary appeared on the RT show hosted by another UK former politician, the ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond. A Lib Dem spokesperson said: Vince has many views which the party has always valued, but appearing on RT is wrong. As a leader his strong criticism of the Salisbury incident and Russian oligarchs here are on the record. Cable said the interview with Salmond had been recorded the previous day and was not connected to Ukraine, and that “with hindsight” he should not have done it. Johnson is due to deliver a televised statement from No 10 about the Russian invasion of Ukraine at noon. He has already said he is “appalled” by what is happening and his skills as a wordsmith are likely to be on full display as he expands on why he feels this is such a calamitous moment for Europe. He is also expected to confirm that the UK will respond with “overwhelming sanctions” (see 9.48am), but the details are not expected to come until this afternoon. The Conservative MP Stephen Hammond has said that the UK should work with Nato allies to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine to help the country defend itself against the Russians. This is an idea that has also been proposed by Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee. (See 10.40am.) Ellwood and David Davis (who is proposing an alternative form of military intervention by the UK - air support to the Ukrainian army) both have a military background (Davis as a reservist, Ellwood as a regular soldier) and both have long been seen as vocal hawks in the Conservative party on military matters. What is interesting about Hammond’s intervention is that he has never been identified as a member of that contingent. Perhaps it’s a sign that Tory support for some form of military intervention might extend more widely than expected. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has described the invasion of Ukraine as “an act of great evil” in a joint statement with Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said the government is preparing to counter possible cyber attacks from Russia in the light of the invasion of Ukraine. Flights between the UK and Ukraine have been suspended as the crisis in the eastern European country intensifies, PA Media reports. PA says: Ukraine closed its airspace in the early hours of Thursday morning after Russia launched a major military assault. The UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice to warn that British nationals in Ukraine “should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating”. Wizz Air cancelled its flights between Luton airport and the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Lviv on Thursday. Ryanair and Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) – the other carriers that fly between the UK and Ukraine – also suspended those routes. Images from the aviation website Flightradar24 show there are no civilian aircraft in Ukrainian airspace and very few over neighbouring Belarus, where many Russian troops are positioned. Boris Johnson will call the invasion of Ukraine “a catastrophe for the continent” when he addresses the nation at noon, ITV’s Anushka Asthana reports. Boris Johnson has confirmed that he will be making an address to the nation this morning about the invasion of Ukraine. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, says the Russian ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office and that the UK will be imposing “severe sanctions”. Keir Starmer says he met Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, this morning to offer his support. David Davis, the Conservative former Brexit secretary (and a former SAS reservist), has said that retaliating against Russia with sanctions will not be enough and that, in order to prevent Ukraine being defeated, the UK should “provide air support to the Ukrainian army”. That would effectively mean the RAF bombing, or threatening to bomb, Russian military positions. Davis has explained his case on Twitter. This is almost certainly a minority view in the Conservative party, and in the Commons as a whole, but Davis is not the first Tory to propose a military response. On Tuesday Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence committee, told Boris Johnson in the Commons that he would like to see Nato establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Ellwood said: We must now consider how we utilise our formidable hard-power deterrence in responding to Ukraine’s calls for further help, not excluding the formation of a potential no-fly zone. That would potentially involve the RAF shooting down, or threatening to shoot down, Russian planes. Back in the Commons Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has just asked Steve Barclay, the PM’s chief of staff, about reports that Russian oligarchs have been lobbying the Foreign Office to ensure they are not covered by sanctions. She asked him for an assurance that none of these people were people who have donated to the Conservative party. Barclay would not answer directly. He said that people who were allowed to vote in the UK can donate to political parties, and he said it was important to remember that the donors Rayner was referring to were British citizens. General Sir Richard Shirreff, the former British officer who was Nato’s deputy supreme allied commander, told the Today programme this morning the possibility of the war in Ukraine leading to military conflict between Britain and Russia could not be ruled out. Asked if this was possible, he replied: Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation could be at war with Russia, because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia. Every single one, every single member of the Nato alliance. Article 5 [of the Nato alliance] says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato. Shirreff has been warning about this for years, and published a book in 2016 anticipating how war with Russia might start. James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, told the Today programme this morning that the initial sanctions announced by the UK failed to act as a deterrent because President Putin is acting illogically and not taking advice. He said: What became evident in the days leading up to this invasion is that Vladimir Putin is increasingly isolated. That bizarre video of him berating his senior officials shows that he’s making these decisions increasingly in isolation and illogically. And unfortunately I think that that is part of the reason why the initial round of international sanctions that [were] put in place by ourselves, by France, Germany, the US, Canada and others, didn’t have the deterrent effect. But he told BBC Breakfast that the UK was now planning “the largest and most severe economic sanctions passage Russia has ever seen”. And this would be effective, he told the Today programme: The sanctions package that will be put in response to this is already actually having an effect. Just the announcement that it’s coming - we’ve seen the Russian stock market, the equivalent of the FTSE, drop by over 30%. That is a huge reduction in Russia’s economic abilities to fund this invasion. And those sanctions will be laid today and over forthcoming days to really prevent Russia from funding this invasion. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has order British airlines to avoid Ukrainian airspace in the light of Russia’s invasion of the country. This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, on the invasion of Ukraine. Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister and chief of staff to the PM, is taking questions in the Commons. He opened with a statement about Ukraine saying the UK would respond to the invasion with “overwhelming sanctions”. He said: I’m sure I speak for the whole house when I say I’m appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine. This is an unprovoked attack by President Putin and the UK and its allies will respond decisively. This morning the prime minister spoke to President Zelenskiy and chaired Cobra and he will make a statement to this house later today to outline the UK response, including overwhelming sanctions. The Cabinet Office is also accelerating work on domestic resilience, and we will provide more information on this in due course. The Commons authorities have just put out an amended timetable, and they say Boris Johnson’s statement to MPs will now be at 5pm. That is to allow Johnson to participate in a virtual G7 meeting in the early afternoon. It is understood that Johnson will also be making a statement about the crisis on camera from No 10 this morning. The Commons authorities have now announced the running order for events in the chamber this morning. Cabinet Office questions go on until 10.30am. After that here is the list of UQs and statements. The timings are approximate, because sometimes statements can overrun. 10.30am: Andrew Bridgen asks an urgent question about compensation to Post Office employees affected by the Horizon software scandal. Around 11.10am: Mark Spencer, leader of the Commons, takes business questions. Around 12.10pm: Boris Johnson makes a statement about Ukraine. After 2.40pm: Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, makes a statement about post-18 education. The Bridgen UQ may have been scheduled to allow Johnson more time to prepare his Ukraine statement. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said President Putin had been “encouraged” to launch a full invasion of Ukraine by the limited nature of the sanctions package unveiled by the UK earlier this week. He told the Today programme: I’m afraid weak sanctions like the ones that were imposed [earlier in the week] just encourage others to believe we are weak because we’re clearly not willing to do anything serious ... What that did, I’m afraid, was it didn’t deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious. If we are going to do sanctions, as I say, we need to do them extremely hard and extremely early. Tugendhat said Russia must now face “extremely hard” penalties. He also said that the conflict would affect the cost of living for people living in the UK. He explained: 10% of the world’s wheat is grown in Ukraine and the idea that this year’s going to be a good crop, I’m afraid, is for the birds. This is absolutely one of those moments where we’re going to see the cost-of-living crisis driven by war. Labour has called for the “hardest possible sanctions” against Russia. Keir Starmer issued this statement earlier this morning. Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustifiable. His actions will have horrendous and tragic consequences that will echo throughout the world and throughout history. All those who believe in the triumph of democracy over dictatorship, good over evil, freedom over the jackboot of tyranny must now support the Ukrainian people. They have been cast onto the frontline of a war, simply for existing. There can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we all depend. There will be dark days ahead. But Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe’s tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail. I know people in this country will be feeling worried and uncertain. And I know that Ukrainians and Russians here in the UK will be worrying for friends and family back home. Our hearts are with them today. We must now match our rhetoric with action. We must urgently reinforce our NATO allies. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK. And those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia’s actions must reckon with their own consciences. Good morning. Boris Johnson has been chairing a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee called in response to the invasion of Ukraine. He was woken overnight to be told of the attack, and before 5am this tweet went out in his name. Shortly afterwards Downing Street issued this statement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the early hours of this morning. The prime minister said he was appalled by the unfolding events in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president updated the prime minister on the attacks taking place, and the prime minister said the West would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people. The prime minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom people during this dark time. Johnson is expected to address MPs later, where he is likely to give details of the escalated “barrage” of sanctions against Russia promised earlier this week. The initial sanctions announced on Tuesday were criticised as relatively feeble. I will be covering UK elements of the crisis here, but for full coverage of the story, and for the global perspective, do read our dedicated live blog. It’s here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Steve Barclary, the Cabinet Office minister and chief of staff to the PM, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: Sajid Javid, the health secretary, gives evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about the Coronavirus Act. After 10.30am: Boris Johnson is expected to make a statement to MPs on Ukraine. After 10.30am: Nadhim Zahawi, the eductation secretary, will make a statement to MPs about plans to reform post-18 education in England. As Sally Weale reports, students in England will have to pay back university loans over 40 years instead of 30 under the plans. 12.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, delivers the Mais lecture. As Phillip Inman reports, Sunak will say he wants to cut taxes “sustainably” and downgrade the role played by the state as an engine of growth. Starmer was due to give a speech on the economy today, but that has now been postponed. As Rowena Mason reports, according to the extracts released in advance, Starmer was going to say Labour will seek to “reimagine the role of government” as a partner to the private sector and take advantage of the opportunities of Brexit, At some point Johnson is also due to attend a virtual G7 meeting. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone.

Iran has previously said it is ideologically opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Donald Trump could pick up Javad Zarif’s remarks as a signal to talk. The White House is pursuing a twin-track strategy of seeking talks while trying to throttle the Iranian economy through sanctions that block trade with Europe and oil sales, and freeze the assets of political and diplomatic leaders. Iran has said it will breach the uranium enrichment limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal on Thursday, but that does not imply the country is on the path to building a nuclear weapon. Zarif pointed to the past use of nuclear weapons by the US and to recent comments by Trump that he had called off a military strike on Iran because it would have killed 150 people. “You were really worried about 150 people? How many people have you killed with a nuclear weapon? How many generations have you wiped out with these weapons?” Zarif said on Tuesday. “It is us who, because of our religious views, will never pursue a nuclear weapon.” The US president again threatened Iran with “obliteration” in a Twitter tirade in which he also accused the country’s leaders of killing 2,000 Americans. “The Iranian leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion’, they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is strength and power, and the USA is by far the most powerful military force in the world, with $1.5tn invested over the last two years alone,” he wrote. “The US has not forgotten Iran’s use of IEDs &amp; EFPs (bombs), which killed 2,000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” The angry tweets came after Iran said the US’s decision to impose sanctions on its supreme leader and other top officials was “idiotic” and had permanently closed the path to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington. Trump imposed fresh sanctions on Monday against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and military chiefs, in an unprecedented step designed to increase pressure on Iran after Tehran’s downing of an unmanned American drone. Khamenei is Iran’s utmost authority, who has the last say on all state matters. Washington said it would also impose sanctions this week on Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, described the White House as “afflicted by a mental disability” and said the sanctions against Khamenei were “outrageous and idiotic”, especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US. Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America’s diplomacy with its own diplomacy, rather than military responses, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat. “Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” the foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.” Speaking in Israel, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door”. Iran’s decision to breach the nuclear deal is a response to US sanctions and Europe’s failure to provide economic protection. It is due to be followed by more serious breaches on 7 July. This places the EU in a dilemma since France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington. The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal, saying: “It is in everyone’s interest to show restraint and avoid any actions that would undermine this vital pillar of the non-proliferation regime and of our collective security.” They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran – a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions – and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: “It is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.” He also ruled out British involvement in military action. “The US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.” He again called for de-escalation, saying: “Neither side wants war, but it is very important for there to be ladders for people to climb down so discussions can take place.” Trump is due to raise the issue of tightening maritime security in the Gulf at a G20 summit starting on Friday in Japan. He wants Asian countries including Korea and Japan to contribute more to defence of shipping in the Gulf especially the strait of Hormuz.Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. “The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appeared to make such talks even less likely. The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions; as long as that is still there, there is no way we can have a dialogue.” The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility. Then last week a US drone was shot down by Iran, further escalating the crisis. The US president responded by ordering an attack on Iran, before pulling back and opting for stronger sanctions instead. Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/nov/16/serhii-plokhy-chernobyl-exposed-soviet-secrecy","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-16T16:30:29Z","webTitle":"Serhii Plokhy: 'Chernobyl exposed Soviet secrecy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/16/serhii-plokhy-chernobyl-exposed-soviet-secrecy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/nov/16/serhii-plokhy-chernobyl-exposed-soviet-secrecy","fields":{"headline":"Serhii Plokhy: 'Chernobyl exposed Soviet secrecy'","bodyText":"Serhii Plokhy, who on Wednesday won the Baillie Gifford non-fiction prize for Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, always intended to write about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, not least because he lived through it. “I was there at the time,” he says of his days as a young university lecturer living 500km downstream from the explosion at the Ukrainian nuclear plant in 1986 that contaminated vast swaths of Europe, worrying if the waters of the Dnieper River had been contaminated. “I remember the horror.” Former classmates were directly affected by the radiation released by the explosion, and he suffered from an inflamed thyroid he believes may have been the result of exposure. Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union in 1986, and the disaster had such an impact on the country that the 61-year-old Plokhy, now professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard, felt he should tell its story. But he was almost too close to it; the testimonies of survivors were too emotional, too powerful. As a historian, he felt he lacked critical distance. It was only with the Ukrainian revolution of 2014 and the subsequent conflict with Russia that Plokhy felt liberated to write about Chernobyl, in part because the catastrophe had suddenly been trumped by new dramas but also because he realised it could be seen as central to everything that followed: glasnost in the Soviet Union, the growth of a nationalist movement in Ukraine, and the collapse five years after the disaster of the crumbling edifice of the Soviet empire. Plokhy was born in Russia to Ukrainian parents but has been based in the US for 20 years. He likens his multiple identities to “a matryoshka doll – open one up and you find another”. “To get a tenure, you have to ask the big questions and think broadly,” he says. “That came naturally. It was how I was trained. But then I integrated a lot of human stories and voices.” The key to the success of the book is that union of personal stories – the managers of the plant who made terrible mistakes and paid with their lives or ended up in prison, the firefighters and soldiers who consigned themselves to almost certain death by trying to stabilise the reactor, the scientists who covered up the design faults – and globally significant history. “The trick was to bring together the very human voices and the bureaucratic documents,” he says. “It looks like the judges [of the prize] think I managed it.” But should we really see Chernobyl as the key to the unravelling of the Soviet Union? “There is a very direct line,” he insists. “The first mass movement in the Soviet Union gathered around ecological issues, and Chernobyl was responsible for that. That was permissible under glasnost; Chernobyl and glasnost are one and the same. I’m not saying there would have been no glasnost without Chernobyl, but glasnost happened when it happened and how it happened because of Chernobyl. It exposed the culture of secrecy and it hit everybody. It didn’t just affect non-party members; it affected party members, the police, the KGB, everybody felt threatened and it suddenly became a legitimate concern of the entire society. Before that, there had been very few concerns that the entire society shared.” According to Plokhy, the pro-independence movement in Ukraine came out of the mobilisation around Chernobyl. “The leaders of the movement maybe don’t say that now,” he argues, “but they used to say it again and again in the late 1980s.” Their success was politically crucial. “The Ukrainian referendum [on independence in December 1991] was the last blow to the dying Soviet Union,” he says. The Soviet empire finally collapsed later that month. He accepts the Soviet Union would eventually have disintegrated anyway – “this was the century when the majority of multi-ethnic, multicultural empires collapsed” as nationalism took root, he says at his big-picture best – but Chernobyl was a crucial trigger, the radiation it released fatally weakening the Soviet body politic. Who was really to blame for the disaster? “There were two sets of characters,” says Plokhy. “The people who made [operational] decisions that led to the disaster and the people at the top who kept silent and didn’t tell their own people what was going on.” He argues that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was culpable. “I see Gorbachev as responsible for being silent,” he says. “It took him two weeks to address the nation. Gorbachev is a hero in many narratives and he did many good things, but I don’t trust him when he says he didn’t have enough information [about the disaster].” Plokhy also blames the Soviet system itself for corrupting science and cutting corners. “There was little regard for safety,” he says. “The attitude came from the race for the atomic bomb; the sacrifice of health and life was almost expected. That culture was transferred to the nuclear power establishment.” The book ends with an impassioned call for the world to learn the lessons of Chernobyl and for the countries beyond the west that are now developing nuclear energy capacity to pay heed to safety concerns. “The next great nuclear-power frontier is Africa,” he writes. “Egypt is currently building two reactors – its first in history. Are we sure that all these reactors are sound?” Autocracy, contempt for the wellbeing of the public and a lax approach towards nuclear safety are a dangerous combination, as the people living close to Chernobyl and the rickety old Soviet empire itself found to their cost. • Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy is published by Allen Lane (£20)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jul/26/morrisons-still-waiting-for-a-policy-spark-but-some-colleagues-have-plenty-of-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-26T20:00:24Z","webTitle":"Morrison's still waiting for a policy spark but some colleagues have plenty of ideas | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/26/morrisons-still-waiting-for-a-policy-spark-but-some-colleagues-have-plenty-of-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jul/26/morrisons-still-waiting-for-a-policy-spark-but-some-colleagues-have-plenty-of-ideas","fields":{"headline":"Morrison's still waiting for a policy spark but some colleagues have plenty of ideas","bodyText":"Let’s start with a public health announcement. Sometimes laughing is better than banging your head on a desk. I confess I chuckled after picking up the Australian on Thursday and reading that Scott Morrison wanted the federal bureaucracy to become more responsive to better serve the quiet Australians. Just in case you missed it, and you may well have, Canberra’s most senior public servants had already been treated to a very similar homily shortly after the Coalition won the election in May. The prime minister used one of his early picture opportunities to engage in some vigorous-sounding talk about congestion-busting in the bureaucracy, and setting clear performance targets – the clear instruction being to get your service delivery to the public right, and crack on with implementing our agenda. I wondered at the time whether any of the senior officials lined up for their public remonstrance had the temerity to ask Morrison, once the summoned television cameras had left the cabinet suite: “Well, what agenda are we implementing prime minister? Did you happen to bring it with you?” I suspect they were far too polite to name check the elephant in the room. In any case, my purpose here is not to be gratuitous, because it is completely reasonable for a prime minister to have high expectations of his officials, and it’s also reasonable for us all to ask whether the federal bureaucracy remains fit for purpose in the digital age, which will doubtless be considered in a forthcoming review headed by former Telstra chief David Thodey. The purpose in beginning with Morrison and his finger-wagging at the mandarins is to work through some of the basic contrasts of the week. Having passed the income tax cuts in the last sitting period, the new parliamentary week from Morrison’s perspective was supposed to be a simple and satisfying exercise. Let’s call the objective, “heads we win, tails we win”. The business of the week was drought assistance, a national security bill, and a union bill. Labor would either oppose the measures, and be castigated as useless and possibly dangerous in their obstruction, or it would support the bills, and be cast as weak for bowing to the government’s agenda. It was wedge week, in other words. We were supposed to be back to the comforting simplicity of the election campaign: “look at those bozos” – but with less time on the Townsville Strand declaring if you vote for Bill Shorten you’ll get Bill Shorten. So thinking through our contrasts, we had Morrison’s muscular “get on with it shiny bums” rhetoric to the public servants. Playing alongside that we had back to the future in the parliament. In the parliamentary theatre, Morrison wants to point the finger at Labor to buy himself time to work out what he wants to do substantively for the coming term (or, more pertinently, make a calculation about how much he can do, given he didn’t seek a mandate from voters to do very much). As getting-through-the-day strategies go, this is logical enough. Sadly for Morrison, Operation Whack Out the Wedge encountered a couple of crosswinds. One was Angus Taylor, and the eminently reasonable questions that won’t go away about the energy minister’s meetings with officials on endangered grasslands, and the possible intersection with his farming interests. The other inconvenience was the ideas boom under way in his own ranks. Coalition MPs are deeply grateful to find themselves still in government. Most of them didn’t expect to be. But given Morrison’s self-professed 18 May miracle has conferred power and opportunity, a number of them don’t want to waste it. Government MPs have policy ideas, and they want to be able to pursue them. That basic dynamic explains the internal breakouts about superannuation, Newstart and nuclear power. But the ideas boom (fuelled in part by the onset of maiden speech season) met an immovable object in this week’s Coalition party room, when Morrison advised colleagues to be good boys and girls, and work on their ideas inside party processes, rather than treat political life as a rolling seminar. Several MPs were pretty miffed with this feedback for a couple of reasons. The first was that some of the ideas brokers and fellow travellers see other colleagues going free range without much apparent blowback. In fact, sometimes the free-rangers are rewarded for allegedly bad behaviour if they need to be accommodated or neutralised for whatever reason. Call this the default perversity of public life. The second element is an underlying current of frustration that has bubbled away inside the government for a long time. I noted a couple of Saturdays ago the vacancy of the Coalition’s policy agenda over the past couple of terms has been largely concealed from public view, hidden in plain sight, in part because Labor has been prepared to style itself as a government in exile – constructing a program, conducting substantial policy debates. It’s a tough report card perhaps, but a fair one given the record since 2013, to observe that the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison governments have lurched between bouts of regicide and managerialism without facing much criticism for their collective lack of imagination as policymakers and purveyors of serious reform. Similar views get expressed privately within the government: a pressing sense that the Coalition is in power, but both time and opportunity are being wasted. So, to put it simply, the current tensions are about a prime minister wanting time and space to chart his own course, and a group of colleagues who know that three-year parliamentary terms are short, and building a public constituency to do something hard takes time. Australia is not standing still, waiting patiently for the Coalition to find sufficient internal equilibrium to be able to move forward. It’s also moot, of course, whether the various ideas doing the rounds are good ones. I can’t fathom why Liberals scratch away relentlessly at superannuation, or why Liberals and Nationals viscerally opposed to carbon pricing would want to reopen a nuclear energy debate, given that’s where that debate inexorably leads. But as the prime minister is fond of saying, you’ve got to have a go to get a go. Given we started with the public servants, I’m inclined to hand the last word to Martin Parkinson, who confirmed this week he would finish up as the secretary of Morrison’s department (the event that triggered round two of the public schooling of public servants). The outgoing secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who has served a Labor government at war with itself and a Liberal government at war with itself – a grim spectacle chewing up more than a decade of his public service – noted that Australia was falling behind in terms of global productivity. Parkinson has an impeccable poker face, so perhaps it’s just me who heard a droll little aside when he observed neutrally that “for whatever reason”, Australia’s productivity performance is just not keeping up. Hmm, I don’t know. Can anyone think what that reason might be? Might we have a stab? Could it be that officials have spent a decade or so working up policies that get legislated and scrapped, or binned before they can even be legislated as a consequence of the revolving door of prime ministers and culture war supplanting facts and evidence – the legacy of Australia’s deranged dance of hyper-partisanship? Could it be that? I think Sir Humphrey would have approved of the locution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jan/22/warren-mundine-picked-by-scott-morrison-to-stand-in-marginal-nsw-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-22T06:51:53Z","webTitle":"Warren Mundine picked by Scott Morrison to stand in marginal seat of Gilmore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/22/warren-mundine-picked-by-scott-morrison-to-stand-in-marginal-nsw-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jan/22/warren-mundine-picked-by-scott-morrison-to-stand-in-marginal-nsw-seat","fields":{"headline":"Warren Mundine picked by Scott Morrison to stand in marginal seat of Gilmore","bodyText":"Indigenous leader Warren Mundine will be parachuted in to contest the marginal seat of Gilmore under a Scott Morrison-endorsed plan being considered by the New South Wales Liberal party executive. On Tuesday the state executive voted to block the preselection of real-estate agent Grant Schultz, who had been picked by local members to contest the seat held by the retiring MP Ann Sudmalis. Schultz reacted angrily to the decision and vowed to run in the seat as an independent. “I can no longer be a member of a party that does not support democracy, or act with integrity,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. The move would complete a lifelong political journey by Mundine from the Labor party, of which he was national president in 2006, to the conservative side of politics, via a stint as the chairman of Tony Abbott’s Indigenous Advisory Council. Mundine has only just applied for Liberal party membership. Morrison said that Mundine is a “top bloke” who has “got a lot to offer – and he’s already been offering quite a bit”. “When I have more to say about our candidate in Gilmore, I’ll say it then,” Morrison told reporters in Cooktown. A series of executive votes will be held to overcome procedural hurdles, including waiver of the six-month waiting period before a new member can be selected as a candidate. NSW Liberal president Philip Ruddock told Guardian Australia the party had “elected not to proceed with [Schultz’s] endorsement” because he had “nominated against a sitting member who later withdrew”. “The party should be able to consider the best candidate to represent voters, their aspirations and concerns in each community,” he said. When asked about female representation Morrison paid tribute to Sudmalis and said he was “absolutely confident” a woman would replace Kelly O’Dwyer in the seat of Higgins, but declined to endorse a female candidate for the seat of Gilmore. Mundine has refused to confirm or deny his intention to run for the Liberals, but told Channel Nine news that an announcement would be made “one way or the other within the next 24 hours”. Gilmore is one of the most marginal seats in the country, won by Sudmalis at the 2016 election by just 1,503 votes, or 0.73%. Mundine is reportedly favoured by Morrison as the best chance to hold the seat, where he has family and ancestral ties despite living in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Mundine attempted to enter federal parliament in 2001, when he was selected third on Labor’s NSW Senate ticket, and 2004, when he contested preselection for the seat of Fowler, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. He left Labor in 2012 after almost 20 years, saying it was “no longer the party I joined”. At a press conference in Rockhampton, Bill Shorten noted that Mundine was “unsuccessful in the Labor party” but added “it’s a free country, you can run for whatever party will have you”. Shorten noted that in Gilmore the Liberal party had “replaced a woman with a man”, and highlighted Mundine’s support for nuclear power by describing him as “a man who wants to put nuclear reactors into Australia, including Jervis Bay”. “I just don’t think [the Liberals] get how everyday Australians think.” The deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, said the selection of candidates is a matter for the NSW division and local branches. “We attract people from all walks of life – people who want to make Australia better, people who believe in the … values of supporting the individual and their enterprise,” he told reporters in Melbourne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2019/jan/23/creepy-things-ordinary-digital-camera-computational-periscopy-can-see-round-corners","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-23T18:00:43Z","webTitle":"Program allows ordinary digital camera to see round corners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/23/creepy-things-ordinary-digital-camera-computational-periscopy-can-see-round-corners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2019/jan/23/creepy-things-ordinary-digital-camera-computational-periscopy-can-see-round-corners","fields":{"headline":"Program allows ordinary digital camera to see round corners","bodyText":"Science may never tell us what lies round the next corner, but researchers have come up with the nearest thing: a computer program that turns a normal digital camera into a periscope. In a demonstration of “computational periscopy” a US team at Boston University showed they could see details of objects hidden from view by analysing shadows they cast on a nearby wall. Vivek Goyal, an electrical engineer at the university, said that while the work had clear implications for surveillance he hoped it would lead to robots that could navigate better and boost the safety of driverless cars. He said: “I’m not especially excited by surveillance, I don’t want to be doing creepy things, but being able to see that there’s a child on the other side of a parked car, or see a little bit around the corner of an intersection could have a significant impact on safety.” The problem of how to see round corners has occupied modern researchers for at least a decade. And while scientists have made good progress in the field, the equipment used so far has been highly specialised and expensive. In the latest feat, Goyal and his team used a standard digital camera and a mid-range laptop. “We didn’t use any sophisticated hardware. This is just an ordinary camera and we are all carrying these around in our pockets,” he said. The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, describe how they pieced together hidden scenes by pointing the digital camera at the vague shadows they cast on a nearby wall. If the wall had been a mirror the task would have been easy, but a matt wall scatters light in all directions, so the reflected image is nothing but a blur. Goyal said: “In essence, computation can turn a matt wall into a mirror.” They found that when an object blocked part of the hidden scene, their algorithms could use the combination of light and shade at different points on the wall to reconstruct what lay round the corner. In tests, the program pieced together hidden images of video game characters – including details such as their eyes and mouths – along with coloured strips and the letters “BU”. Given the relative simplicity of the program and equipment, Goyal believes it could be possible for humans to learn the same trick. In a draft blog written for Nature, he said: “It is even conceivable for humans to be able to learn to see around corners with their own eyes; it does not require anything superhuman.” At the moment, the program takes about 48 seconds to work out a hidden scene from a digital image, but Goyal believes it could be done much faster with more computer power. Eventually, it may be fast enough to run on video footage. In an accompanying article, Martin Laurenzis, an imaging expert at the French–German Research Institute of Saint-Louis, explains that with multiple images to draw on, the technique could track the movement of hidden targets. But it could also have much broader uses, he said, in microscopy, medical imaging and monitoring in hazardous environments such as chemical plants or nuclear power stations. Laurenzis said: “The technique could be used by vehicles to avoid collisions, and by firefighters and first responders to look into burning or collapsed structures.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T16:41:38Z","webTitle":"US switches focus of its Bonn event from clean energy to fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"US switches focus of its Bonn event from clean energy to fossil fuels","bodyText":"The US has changed the focus of one of its few public events at the Bonn climate talks to emphasise coal and nuclear power, in a sign of the Trump administration’s goals at the talks. An event next Monday, opening the second week of the ongoing UN negotiations, was originally billed as promoting clean energy. However, it has since been changed to emphasise coal and nuclear power. The event was first billed with the title Action on Spurring Innovation and Deploying Advanced Technologies but was subsequently changed. The same event has now been retitled to: The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation. The speakers are listed as the same, but the explanation of the event’s focus has also changed markedly, from talk of “innovative solutions” and “transforming development pathways” to a strong statement in favour of fossil fuels. It now reads: “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean. This panel will explore how the US will be a leader in cutting carbon emissions through cleaner, more efficient fossil fuels and other energy sources.” There was no explanation of the change. A US state department official declined to comment before the event but noted it would be open to all at the conference. However, observers said the change was in line with the US government’s stance at the talks, which are focused on how to improve countries’ carbon-cutting targets under the Paris agreement of 2015. Andrew Light of the World Resources Institute said: “Whoever the Trump administration is trying to target with this event, it isn’t people in the negotiating hall – they’re clearly focused on the booming global markets in renewable energy. At best, this event will be a curiosity, given the isolation of the US now in the international process.” Although US president Donald Trump has begun the process of removing the US from the Paris agreement, this will not take effect, under the UN processes, until 2020. This means the US is still a party to the agreement and still present at the talks. However, for the first time in at least a decade, the US has no visible official representation. Under Obama, there was always a large US pavilion at the annual meetings – and even under George W Bush, who vowed to keep the US out of the Kyoto protocol even when other countries had ratified it and brought it into force in 2005. At Bonn, the US occupies a small locked room that often seems unoccupied. There is no pavilion, and Monday’s event on coal and nuclear power is the first public sign of the US government’s engagement, though the UN said US delegates were present at at least some of the many meetings taking place around the event."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/feb/11/biggest-offshore-windfarm-to-start-uk-supply-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-11T16:55:16Z","webTitle":"Biggest offshore windfarm to start UK supply this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/11/biggest-offshore-windfarm-to-start-uk-supply-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/feb/11/biggest-offshore-windfarm-to-start-uk-supply-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Biggest offshore windfarm to start UK supply this week","bodyText":"An offshore windfarm on the Yorkshire coast that will dwarf the world’s largest when completed is to supply its first power to the UK electricity grid this week. The Danish developer Ørsted, which will be installing the first of 174 turbines at Hornsea One, said it was ready to step up its plans and fill the gap left by failed nuclear power schemes. The size of the project takes the burgeoning offshore wind power sector to a new scale, on a par with conventional fossil fuel-fired power stations. Hornsea One will cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull. At 1.2GW of capacity it will power 1m homes, making it about twice as powerful as today’s biggest offshore windfarm once it is completed in the second half of this year. “The ability to generate clean electricity offshore at this scale is a globally significant milestone at a time when urgent action needs to be taken to tackle climate change,” said Matthew Wright, UK managing director of Ørsted, the world’s biggest offshore windfarm builder. The power station is only the first of four planned in the area, with a green light and subsidies already awarded to a second stage due for completion in the early 2020s. The first two phases will use 7MW turbines, which are taller than London’s Gherkin building. But the latter stages of the Hornsea development could use even more powerful, 10MW-plus turbines. Bigger turbines will capture more of the energy from the wind and should lower costs by reducing the number of foundations and amount of cabling firms need to put into the water. Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted’s chief executive, said he was in close dialogue with major manufacturers to use the new generation of turbines, some of which are expected to approach the height of the Shard in London, the tallest building in the EU. The UK has a great wind resource and shallow enough seabed to exploit it, and could even “power most of Europe if it [the UK] went to the extreme with offshore”, he said. Offshore windfarms could help ministers fill the low carbon power gap created by Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping nuclear plants, the executive suggested. “If nuclear should play less of a role than expected, I believe offshore wind can step up,” he said. New nuclear projects in Europe had been “dramatically delayed and over budget”, he added, in comparison to “the strong track record for delivering offshore [wind]”. The UK and Germany installed 85% of new offshore wind power capacity in the EU last year, according to industry data. The average power rating of the turbines is getting bigger too, up 15% in 2018. The turbines for Hornsea One are built and shipped from Siemens Gamesa’s factory in Hull, part of a web of UK-based suppliers that has sprung up around the growing sector. Around half of the project’s transition pieces, the yellow part of the structure that connects the foundation to the tower, are made in Teesside. Many of the towers themselves are made by a firm in Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. Altogether, about half of the components for the project are made in the UK. Ørsted is not yet ready to bid for a share of a £60m pot of further offshore windfarm subsidies, to be auctioned by the government this summer, but expects the price to reach even more competitive levels than those seen in 2017. Like other international energy companies, Ørsted has put in place contingency planning in event of a no-deal Brexit – but the hope is that will not come to pass. “We want a Brexit deal that will facilitate an orderly transition out of the union,” said Poulsen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
