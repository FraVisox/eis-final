UK and Australia fight over Stubbs painting, 22 August, page 5) misnamed Ron Radford, director of the National Gallery of Australia, as Don Radford. An editing error also led to it suggesting that a portrait of Captain Cook by Nathaniel Dance was sold last year by descendants of Sir Joseph Banks, together with the Stubbs paintings. As the longer online version of the article said, the Cook portrait has been in the UK's national collection since 1820, when Banks died: it was donated to the naval gallery at Greenwich hospital, and transferred to the National Maritime Museum when that was founded in 1937. • A feature (Fracks and figures, 20 August, page 6, G2) about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking – a process in which liquids are pumped deep underground to release oil or gas supplies – included a sentence which could have been read as suggesting that the extraction of coal does not release methane gas; that is incorrect. • An editorial about the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 2011 (The global fallout, 22 August, page 32) said that the plant's operator had admitted this week that 3,000 tonnes of highly toxic water had leaked from purpose-built storage tanks; 300 tonnes, that should have said. • Coalition battle looms over anti-terror laws after Greenwald partner detention was amended because an editing error led to the earlier version referring to \"the UK or Northern Ireland\" in the eighth paragraph; Northern Ireland is part of the UK. • Grant Morrison: why I'm resurrecting Wonder Woman was amended because the original subheading described Wonder Woman as \"the Amazonian\"; she is an Amazon. • English seaside towns suffer from above-average deprivation, finds study was amended because the original version placed South Shields in County Durham; it was in that county but has been in Tyne and Wear since 1974, when a reorganisation of local government took place. • Dolphin spotted swimming miles up River Dee was amended because the earlier version said that Saltney is in Cheshire.

Permission to install the six squat machines, which look like underwater propellers, has been granted by Scottish ministers as a demonstration project to prove they work, with more than 50 of the machines eventually due to be installed on the seabed off Caithness. The fast-moving waters off Scotland's northern coasts and islands are seen as among the most valuable in the world for tidal and wave power, with Scottish ministers claiming there is enough capacity to replace three coal-fired power stations the size of the UK's largest, at Drax in Yorkshire. Approval for the scheme was applauded by environmentalists. Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said it was great news for the renewable industry. \"Harnessing the huge energy in the tides of the Pentland Firth is a major engineering challenge, but this scheme will prove technologies and techniques which will be important in future tidal energy schemes around the world,\" he said. Tidal energy has two main advantages over wind power: it is more predictable and it does not attract criticism from people who object to the visual impact of wind turbines on land. However, it is much more expensive because the technology is less developed. The first phase of the project by MeyGen, a joint venture between the giant US investment bank Morgan Stanley, the French-owned energy firm International Power and the Australian turbine manufacturer Atlantis Resources Corporation, will generate up to 9MW to prove the technology works. The consent granted by Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, will allow MeyGen to slowly enlarge the scheme to hit 86MW by the end of the decade, enough to power about 46,000 homes – about 40% of homes in the Highlands. Ewing said: \"We must tackle climate change. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels through better and more efficient uses of energy. Marine energy – a homegrown technology with huge potential – is part of the solution.\" Environment campaigners said the decision increased pressure on ministers in both the UK and Scottish governments to support the industry by investing far more in the electricity grid and in financial support to help cut the considerably higher costs faced by renewables schemes in northern Scotland. Lang Banks, director of the environment group WWF Scotland, said he was stunned by apparently dismissive remarks by Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate change secretary about the prospects of extra subsidies for northern tidal and wave schemes. Davey announced at the Liberal Democrat conference that onshore windfarms on Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles would get a higher guaranteed price for their electricity than onshore windfarms anywhere else in the UK, to help meet their higher costs. But asked by the Guardian if the same subsidies would be given to wave and tidal projects and offshore wind developments in the same areas in future, he said no, and described the question as hypothetical. Banks said that Davey was undermining confidence in the industry, coming on the same day that the Lib Dems agreed to billions of pounds of support for new nuclear power stations. \"It's really, really important that governments give clear signals about what they want to do to build confidence in new renewable technologies. In the week Davey gave that support to nuclear power, it's unacceptable that he's not offering the same clear signals to real zero-carbon projects like wave and tidal,\" Banks said. The MeyGen scheme will be Europe's largest tidal array project – a type of scheme where turbines are clustered across an area of seabed. Eventually MeyGen wants to dramatically expand it to 398MW, making it one of the world's biggest renewables projects. Until that much larger scheme gets permission from the Crown Estate and Scottish ministers, it will not be the largest of all Europe's tidal power plants: the La Rance tidal barrage built across the Rance river in Brittany, northern France, nearly 40 years ago has a peak rating of 240MW from its 24 turbines. Proposals for a more ambitious scheme to build a tidal barrage across the Severn estuary, said to be capable of meeting 5% of the UK's total energy needs, have again stalled after permission was refused by ministers on environmental grounds. The AR-1000 turbines used in the Pentland Firth, which were first tested at the EMEC marine energy test centre in Orkney, will each weigh 1,500 tonnes but are far shorter than offshore wind turbines, standing at 22.5 metres (73ft) with a rotor 18 metres across. Installing and running these machines in the harsh north Atlantic waters off northern Scotland is highly challenging because of the extreme weather conditions, strength of the tides and depths of water. The Scottish government's estimates that the Pentland Firth, where tides race between the Atlantic and North Sea through a narrow eight-mile gap, can support 14GW of installed capacity are disputed by experts. Thomas Adcock, from Oxford University, told the Guardian that the most robust estimate was that it would allow 1.9GW of power plant to be installed, even though the Firth is \"almost certainly the best site for tidal stream power in the world\". Environmentalists also fear such developments will stall because of the costs of getting the power to the biggest markets in the southern UK and a lack of financial backing from ministers. Power stations in northern Scotland are charged far higher electricity transmission costs because of their distance from southern England, and the grid needs to have expanded, at a cost of billions of pounds, to take the power south. Last week, the spending watchdog Audit Scotland warned that Alex Salmond's ambitious target of generating 100% of Scotland's electricity needs would fail without greater investment from the UK and from power companies. It emerged on Monday that another large tidal demonstration project by Scottish Power Renewables in the Sound of Islay off the west coast, involving a 10MW installation, would be using eight large turbines built by two firms Alstom and Andritz Hydro Hammerfest. Once those machines were tested, Scottish Power Renewables hopes to build a 95MW tidal power scheme off Duncansby in Caithness, just east of the Pentland Firth using the same devices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/feb/20/rwe-npower-nuclear-subsidies-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-20T19:22:43Z","webTitle":"RWE boss warns over nuclear plant subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/20/rwe-npower-nuclear-subsidies-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/feb/20/rwe-npower-nuclear-subsidies-warning","fields":{"headline":"RWE boss warns over nuclear plant subsidies","bodyText":"RWE npower, one of the big six power suppliers, has warned ministers not to seal a long-term subsidy deal with the nuclear industry behind the backs of consumers and saddle them with \"unnecessarily high bills\" for the next 40 years. The warning from Paul Massara, RWE UK's new chief executive, comes as the Guardian can reveal that up to 15 private sector executives with links to the atomic sector have been seconded to government departments or other public sector roles. \"We are very concerned that decisions currently being taken around guaranteed revenue from new nuclear power stations in return for their delivery could force the next three generations of British consumers to pay an unexpected and perhaps unnecessarily high bill for the next 40 years, especially given the track record of delivery of nuclear power stations,\" said Massara. \"There must be an open and honest conversation about the future direction of energy bills. Customers must be given the best information to be able to make informed decisions, take control of their bills and reduce their energy waste.\" RWE, along with another big six supplier, E.ON, recently sold its interest in the Horizon project to build nuclear power plants in Britain at Wylfa in north Wales and Oldbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire. The German-owned company has spent more than £3bn in the last three years building gas and wind power installations as it prepares to close old coal-fired plants. Massara said he understood the warning this week about a looming power crunch from Alistair Buchanan, the head of Ofgem, the energy regulator, but said all technologies should be encouraged to ensure the UK's future energy supply is not only clean and secure but also affordable. \"We believe UK customers should not be made to write a blank cheque to pay for new power stations,\" he added. A Freedom of Information request undertaken by the campaign group, NuclearSpin.org, showed at least 15 people working for the nuclear energy industry or its consultants have been seconded to areas responsible for policy or regulation, some being paid for by the taxpayer. EDF Energy, which has asked ministers to consider a 40-year subsidy scheme for its proposed UK plants, has seconded two staff to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) at the Health and Safety Executive. One is interim programme manager for the ONR's programme at the Sellafield plant in Cumbria and is paid for by EDF. The other is a technical assistant on the Decommissioning Fuel and Waste Programme. Rolls-Royce, which describes itself as \"part of the UK's nuclear industry for the past 50 years\", is providing the head of new nuclear capabilities and removing barriers at the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Sophie Macfarlane-Smith is responsible for \"enhancing the capability\" of the UK's \"new nuclear supply chain and skills\". Engineering consultant Atkins Ltd is providing a policy adviser for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' commercial nuclear policy team and Babcock, which describes itself as \"the UK's largest specialist nuclear support services organisation\" has seconded two staff to the ONR. A DECC spokesperson said secondees brought with them knowledge and experience which are vital to helping the department do its job effectively. \"DECC ensures that any secondee is bound by the professional Code of Practice relevant to their industry ... There are contractual measures in place to make sure than any employee seconded into DECC is not placed in a position where there could be a conflict of interest.\" • This article was amended on 21 February 2013. The original said that a secondee from EDF Energy to the Office for Nuclear Regulation \"costs the ONR between £50,000 and £100,000 a year\". In fact the full cost of secondments to the ONR is charged to the nuclear industry. The ONR has also asked us to clarify that it has safeguards in place to ensure there is no conflict of interest; no secondee works on matters directly related to their parent organisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/jun/23/the-nationals-unclear-future-economic-developers-or-a-country-getup","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-23T06:07:39Z","webTitle":"The Nationals' unclear future: economic developers or a country GetUp!? | Gabrielle Chan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/the-nationals-unclear-future-economic-developers-or-a-country-getup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/the-nationals-unclear-future-economic-developers-or-a-country-getup","fields":{"headline":"The Nationals' unclear future: economic developers or a country GetUp!?","bodyText":"When veteran Queensland National party senator Ron Boswell rose to give his valedictory speech, he evoked Liberal party founder Robert Menzies to put the steel in the spine of his colleagues. “[Menzies] said Australian Liberals are not the exponents of an open go, for if we are all to have an open go, each for himself, and the devil take the hindmost, anarchy will result and both security and progress disappear.” “Just keep remembering it,” Boswell said. “These are prophetic words. The Liberal party founder was saying that deregulation is not the answer to all problems and the free market will not always produce the best outcomes.” As sections of the National party threaten to cross the floor on Tony Abbott’s paid parental leave (PPL) scheme, the fundamental differences between the Coalition partners are again becoming clear. It stands to reason. The National party has a very different raison d’etre to the Liberal party. The organisation, which began as the agrarian Country party, still has its basis in the philosophy of country-mindedness; that rural people are essential to the nation’s prosperity and identity. The Country party became known for some of the most interventionist policies in Australian politics. The modern day National party is harder to read than the one led by the likes of former leader John “Black Jack” McEwen, a name proudly mentioned by Boswell last week. Where McEwen had no problems holding the Liberal party to ransom – at one stage torpedoing Billy McMahon, their choice of prime minister – Nationals leader Warren Truss is the ultimate coalitionist. His errant senators protesting PPL are a rare departure from coalition discipline. For the truth is, on economic policy there is very little difference between the Liberals and the Nationals. Boswell underlined it, when he pointed to the economic rationalists on his own side, planning for pinhead-sized government, and reminded them it wasn't even in keeping with their own Liberal tradition, let alone the National party's. In spite of Boswell’s words, his message has been largely lost on the Liberals' constituency. He's been drowned out by the recent budget measures that cut support to National party electorates, which rely more than most on government payments and programs. The Liberal party, through its treasurer Joe Hockey, has clearly set out its economic agenda of small government. The Nationals’ agenda is less clear. The party excels at articulating what they don’t want, but rarely outlines what they do want, apart from policies for sectional interests like agriculture and road development. What then, for the constituents in small towns, who may be marginalised, unemployed, on pensions – those who are not involved in the agricultural supply chain? Deputy leader Barnaby Joyce acknowledged his party held some of the poorest people in Australia but his prescription is economic development. “They don’t live on farms, they are some of the poorest people in Australia, they are indigenous and poor – for want of a better word – white people, who are the truly forgotten Australians, with no special program or department,” Joyce told The Guardian Australia. “If I can be belligerent and push economic progress, that is the part that lives on, it is economic growth.\" He quotes Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal programs after the great depression, particularly the Tennessee Valley authority, which was a publicly-owned power provider. “The Tennessee Valley augmentation scheme, which I have visited, was a scheme that generated hydroelectricity and provided cheap power, it attracted industry, nuclear power, coal mines and provided jobs which increased standards of living, which are vastly better than social security payments.” The National party has remained doggedly anti-environmentalist. But some common ground exists between farmers, in their self-assessment as stewards of the land, and rural environmentalists – some aligned with the Greens – who can drive support and political will towards the bush. Joyce attacked largely city-based “environmentalists” who lobby for protection of the land over industry, and then request social security packages for workers who lose their jobs. He quotes his chairmanship of the prime minister’s dams committee and the increased road funding from hypothecation of the fuel excise as concrete examples which would lift rural Australia. “[Enivonmentalists] want to discuss social security, which would deliver one tenth of what these people were getting when they were working and all they do is create a multi-generational destitution trap,” he said. Where do the Nationals go from here? Their closest international variant, the Nordic farmer parties, reinvented themselves as more progressive, centrist parties – anti-socialist, economically interventionist but socially conservative, with strong environmental policies. Former independent and National party member Tony Windsor is one who believed rural representatives should remain in the centre and out of coalition. Doing so would ensure a more regular chance at holding the balance of power, increasing the Nationals' leverage and ability to deliver results for the country. In any case, the party is under siege from all sides. Clive Palmer, a former lifetime National party member, leads a party that is already sitting on nearly twice the vote of the National Party (5-5.5%, versus 3%). The Greens are pushing into National territory in rural areas on the issue of mining versus farming. Meanwhile, unnamed Liberal party sources actively destabilised the coalition relationship after the budget by leaking stories about gaming the Nationals on diesel fuel negotiations. Meanwhile, Indi independent Cathy McGowan has proved members in safe electorates ignore their seats at their own peri. She, like Windsor, showed there is a receptive audience for more progressive policy positions. For example, she accepts the science on climate change and believes a market mechanism, such as Labor's emissions trading scheme plan, is the best way to lower emissions. McGowan also supports same sex marriage. Charles Sturt University academic Troy Whitford has long been studying and involved with the party, though he is currently not a member. He says there has been a long history of mavericks like Clive Palmer and Pauline Hanson appealing to the bush, but the party has endured in spite of regular reports of its demise. He believes Palmer relies on the National party's coalition discipline. If they don't speak out against Liberal policies, it provides Palmer a better platform to garner disaffected votes from people who can’t see the difference. “There is a case that people need to see differences of opinion a bit more openly and there is nothing wrong with diversity. After all, that is what healthy debate is all about,” Whitford said. But he cannot see a day when the National parliamentarians split from the Liberals in order to differentiate, though there have been instances, such as the West Australian Nationals, who split and achieved the $6.5bn Royalties for Regions program. “They are so hung up on coalition, there isn’t the political will amongst the parliamentarians,” he said. “Within the general party there is.\" \"At the end of the day they have mortgages to pay, ambitions to serve, they are are not going to throw themselves on their sword, that is one of the depressing realities.” Whitford believes decent broad-based rural advocacy is lacking in country Australia, the type of advocacy that speaks for many interests in rural areas, towns and regional cities, not just agriculture. “What we need is a country GetUp! that drives change,” Whitford said. There is no doubt that a vacuum in political advocacy for rural and regional Australia exists. Palmer, Labor and the Greens have all identified it, as has McGowan. There is little sign that the National party will change their modus operandi, though that is not to say there are not pockets of thinking outside the box. The party's recent NSW conference passed a motion put by a young member and teacher, to support the Better Schools Gonski funding for the full six years, with the blessing of NSW education minister Adrian Piccoli. The conference also heard a motion to ensure there was no cut to the Renewable Energy Target and one to increase the Newstart allowance \"as it is manifestly inadequate\". The political environment has changed a lot since Menzies first spoke against an \"open go\". Labor deregulated the economy, while the Liberal Party put the neo in neoliberalism. It has had both benefits and pitfalls for the National party's constituency. Big and medium farming has thrived but those \"restructured\" out of a job in the regions have joined the ranks of Joyce's rural poor. If the Nationals are to survive and thrive, the party would do well to look further outside its sectional interests and remember Boswell's warning. A little bit of intervention, for the sake of its constituency, is not a dirty word."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2014/dec/16/hague-publishes-english-votes-for-english-laws-evel-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-16T17:48:11Z","webTitle":"Cameron questioned by MPs about climate change and radicalistion: Politics Live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/16/hague-publishes-english-votes-for-english-laws-evel-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2014/dec/16/hague-publishes-english-votes-for-english-laws-evel-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Cameron questioned by MPs about climate change and radicalistion: Politics Live blog","bodyText":"Cameron says that a Sydney-style terrorist attack could happen in Britain “at any moment”. This is what he said when Keith Vaz asked him how close Britain was to that kind of attack. The threat we face definitely includes those sort of self-starting, sometimes quite random attacks that could happen at any moment in Britain. We’ve seen, over the last few months, there have been a series of plots that have been detected and prevented that would have seen police officers, or other authority figures, murdered in cold blood, as Lee Rigby was murdered in cold blood. It is thanks to the brilliance of our policing and security services that these things have been prevented. We can’t count on them to prevent it every time because it is one thing understanding the terror networks coming out of Pakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria, trying to monitor what they’re doing, who’s going and who’s returning. That’s one thing. But people who are self-radicalised on the internet, who then suddenly do appalling things, that is much more difficult to prevent. He said the government had not done enough to challenge the narrative that draws people towards extremism. This is what he told Vaz. If you are saying we are not doing enough to challenge the underlying narrative that has been the starting point for some people to be seduced from a moderate Islam approach to something that accepts the narrative of the extremists, I agree with you. He said he was opposed to any more onshore windfarms. Confirming that the Tories would scrap subsidies for onshore windfarms after 2015, he said the public were “fed up” with them and that he did not expect any more to be erected without subsidy. On onshore windfarms, I think the public are, frankly, fed up with so many windfarms being built that won’t be necessary. Now we’ve reached some 10% of our electricity by onshore wind, we don’t need to have more of these subsidised onshore. So let’s get rid of the subsidy, put them into the planning system and, if they can make their case, they can make their case. I suspect they won’t. And we’ll have a reasonable amount of onshore wind, we will have safer electricity supplies as a result, but enough is enough. I’m very clear about that. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Cameron says Cobra, the emergency committee, takes advice from scientists. But it does not simply do what they say. There is a need for politicians to take political decisions beyond that, he says. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary shortly. Q: What would you do if another country, like Pakistan, refused to take back someone considered a threat? Cameron says the prisons are full of people he would like to return to their home country. So he believes in being “pretty tough” on this. Keith Vaz goes next. Q: The Sunday Times recently reported that passports were removed from 22 people, the entire family of someone suspected of terrorism involvement abroad. Is that the kind of thing the government will be doing? Cameron says he does not know the details of this case. But he has confidence in what Theresa May is doing. The police need a suite of powers to keep us safe, he says. Sir Alan Beith, the chair of the justice committee, is asking questions now. Q: Are we able to recruit enough Imams to serve in jails, to counter extremism there? Cameron says his understanding is that they are. This hearing has been shown on C-SPAN in the US. Rory Stewart, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, goes next. Q: To what extent is destroying Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria a priority? It is a priority, he says. This is a terrorist body that runs a state, has weapons and has land. We will not deal with the problem of tackling the terrorist narrative unless we fight Isis, he says. Cameron says the new government bill saying public bodies have a duty to combat extremism will make a big difference. Vaz turns to the dark internet. Q; Shouldn’t you set up something like the Internet Watch Foundation, to allow people to report dark internet sites? Cameron says the internet companies have become much better at dealing with child abuse images. They have blocked 10,000 search terms, and Google searches related to abuse have gone down 80%. They have been slower at dealing with terrorist material on the web, he says. Q: We don’t seem to have stopped people becoming radicalised. Cameron says he agrees that the government has not been able to counter the extremism narrative. But a lot has been done, he says. We need everyone to rise up and say this is not acceptable, he says. When he makes this point, he is not getting at Muslims. Q: I represent 15,000 Muslims. The problem is caused by a tiny minority. Cameron says it is a minority of a minority of a minority. Q: What is your message to people like the mother of Yusuf Sarwar, who cooperated with police when her son went to fight in Syria and then saw him sentenced to 12 years. Cameron says he was not in the court room, so he cannot comment on all the evidence. We have to allow the police and the prosecution service to work, he says. Keith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, is asking the questions now. Q: How important is this in your overall priorities? Cameron says his twin priorities are economic security and national security. This is part of national security. If you go back and look at his old speeches, the need to challenge extremism is an issue he has always raised. Q: How close are we to a Sydney-style attack? Cameron says the threat we face definitely includes the possibility of a random attack from a self-starter. Plots to attack police officers have been thwarted, he says. It is hard to prevent attacks from people who have been “self-radicalised”. Cameron says he set up an extremism task force. He likes bringing ministers together to work on a subject, he says. Of all the things he’s done, he thinks this has been moderately successful. The energy section of the hearing is over. Now the committee is tacking radicalisation. Cameron says it is only when communities see other communities benefit from fracking that they will come round to supporting the idea. David TC Davies, the Conservative chair of the Welsh affairs committee, is asking the questions now. Q: Would fracking be allowed in national parks? Only in exceptional circumstances, he says. But he says the government has not said what those might be. He says he understands how concerned people are about fracking. That will only change when they see what it is like when it actually happens. Cameron says the green groups do not want to hear anything good about shale gas. Cameron says the shale gas industry has already committed that every site will have an environmental impact assessment. Cameron says some of the green groups are opposed to shale gas because it is gas. They cannot bear the fact that it is a carbon fuel. They oppose it with a religiosity that is just wrong. Cameron says one fracking well uses less water in its lifetime than a golf course uses in a month. “Interesting fact,” he says. Q: You are asking the public to take a lot on trust. Why was the shale gas report published by Defra so heavily redacted? Cameron says he will look at that. Going back to McIntosh’s question about self-monitoring of seismic activity, he says this does happen. But companies lose their permits if they do not report activity. This is not an industry subject to under-regulation, he says. Anne McIntosh, the Conservative chair of the environment committee, goes next. Q: Will you put an end to the self-monitoring of fracking companies? What do you mean. McIntosh mentions a fracking company that carried on fracking after a minor earthquake. Cameron says he thinks a robust system is in place already. We need a sensible debate, he says. When he looks at some of the emails .... Cameron tails off, but he implies that people raise unreasonable fears. We need more myth-busting, he says. Andrew Miller, the Labour chair of the science committee, says many of his constituents work for high-energy firms. But the government also wants to cut energy use. Q: Do you agree that science is not finished until it is communicated? Yes, says Cameron. He says he tells scientists he values the work they do. They are good at busting myths. But they should communicated these messages, because they are trusted more than politicians, Cameron says. Cameron says he believes in cutting carbon at the lowest cost. There have been disagreements in the coalition, but not huge ones. The public is fed up with onshore wind farms, he says. He wants to cut their subsidy. Enough is enough, he says. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Lib Dem chair of the international development committee, is asking the questions. Q: Why is the £720m for the Green Development Fund coming from the aid budget? That’s not new money, because it’s from the aid budget. Cameron says it is money that wasn’t in the Green Development Fund but is now. Cameron says there is an argument in the aid world as to whether you should help the poorest people, or the poorest countries. He favours helping the poorest people in the poorest countries. Cameron says the Green Investment Bank should be the “first investor”. There are plenty of other investors, like pension funds, also keen to invest in energy. Adrian Bailey, the Labour chair of the business committee, goes next. Cameron says he recently asked energy investors if Britain was a good place to invest, and if it offered long-term security. They said it was a good place to invest, he says. The Green Investment Bank has plenty more spending to do. Q: The problem seems to be that it is not spending enough. Cameron says it has spent £1.6bn of the £3.8bn available. Energy companies are very positive about investing in the UK. Cameron says the government is not subsidising fracking with a guaranteed price per hour. It is a nascent industry. What the government is doing is giving it a tax break to help it get going. The way you tax a new industry is different from the way you tax an existing industry, he says. Joan Walley, the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, is asking the questions. Q: Don’t you accept that new nuclear power stations are being subsidised by the government? No, he does not accept that, Cameron says. The government wants to cut carbon emissions, but also to have a secure energy supply. As part of that, it is right to have the regeneration of the British nuclear industry. Without that, and without oil and gas, we would be in real trouble. The sun does not shine enough in this country, he says. He says any subsidy is offered through a guaranteed price. But the price guaranteed for nuclear power is higher than the price guaranteed for wind power. Cameron says the North Sea is a valuable industry for the UK. He hopes that carbon capture and storage will come about, so he hopes that gas will play a part in energy production for a long time. Without gas, the country would have to rely on subsidised renewable energy and very expensive nuclear power. Cameron started his evidence by paying tribute to those killed in the attacks in Australia and Pakistan. Tim Yeo, chair of the energy committee, goes first. Q: Do you expect to continue with the carbon budget process? Yes, says Cameron. A new decision is due by 2016. But, he says, his only reservation is about keeping costs down. He does not know yet what new technology will become available. You can watch the hearing here. David Cameron is about to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee. According to the committee, these are the issues due to come up. Climate Change and new energy sources and technologies The issues likely to be raised include: · National carbon budgets and pricing · Energy subsidies · Green investment bank powers, the Green Deal, and policy co-ordination and stability · The International Climate Fund and the Green Climate Fund · Communication of climate science and risk · Exploiting shale gas and fracking · Local employment and skills · Exploration and assumptions · The impact on the landscape. Radicalisation The issues likely to be raised include: · The Prime Minister’s Task Force on tackling radicalisation and extremism · The Prevent Strategy and the Channel programme · Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures · Extremism in schools · Foreign Fighters · Radicalisation in Prisons · Temporary exclusion from the United Kingdom William Hague, the leader of the Commons, has published a short command paper backing the principle of English votes for English laws (Evel) but revealing how little agreement there is within government about how it should happen. The paper only runs to 33 pages, and almost half of it relates to devolution measures already taken by the government that do not relate to Commons voting procedures. The paper proposes four Evel options (see 1.29pm), three Tory ones and one Lib Dem one, but does not say which David Cameron prefers. Hague has said that he wants a debate and vote on this next year, but he gave no indication today what MPs would actually vote on. The Conservatives have marginally firmed up their commitment to Evel. All three options would effectively give English MPs a veto over English-only legislation. (One is just described as giving English MPs “the decisive say”, but the difference between having a veto and having the decisive say is not clear). Previously one option has been the approach set out last year in the report from the McKay Commission. The commission floated several options, all of which involved English MPs voting on English-only matters, but the House of Commons as a whole having the last word. This approach was intended to encourage compromise where English MPs and the Commons as a whole disagreed. But Hague said all three Conservative options were “stronger and more binding” that what McKay proposed. Conservative MPs have warmly welcomed the principle of English votes for English laws. But, during Hague’s statement in the Commons, most of the Tory MPs who spoke out in support did not say which of the three Conservative versions of Evel they supported. It is not at all clear which of the options would attract most support in a Commons vote. Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, has reaffirmed Labour’s support for a modest version of the McKay plan. But he also accused Hague of a stitch up. Constitutional experts have urged the government to proceed cautiously. David Jones, the Conservative former Welsh secretary, has expressed concerns about the impact of Evel on Wales. He said it would be “wholly wrong” to stop Welsh MPs voting on English matters that concerned them. Many people in Wales were heavily reliant on English services, he said. Addressing Hague he said: Would you agree with me it would be wrong to equate the positions of Wales and Scotland? Do you as a former secretary of state for Wales himself acknowledge that large numbers of people in Wales are heavily reliant on services delivered in England and therefore it would be wholly wrong if the representatives of those people were to be denied a voice on issues which so clearly concern them? Hague conceded this was an issue. He said it was addressed in the command paper. Michael Kenny at the Staggers says Labour’s fears about English votes for English laws are exaggerated. Labour’s particular fears about the consequences of its introduction are greatly exaggerated. Were it to form, or be part of, a government made up of different parties in the next parliament, it is possible that Labour might, on some occasions, have to refine its legislative programme in the face of English opinion in the Commons. But what exactly is the democratic argument against it – or any other, UK government – having to do exactly that? On the Daily Politics Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister and prominent pro-European, predicted that one day Britain would join the euro. We will join the euro. It is not [the view of the Conservative party]. It is a very personal view, which the establishment party wouldn’t agree with. If I have to parade my conviction; I have lived through every one of these European arguments where we have resisted at every stage the European direction, and in every stage we in the end have given in and joined. I’ve taken the quote from PoliticsHome. Jim Murphy, the new Scottish Labour leader, has unveiled his Scottish shadow cabinet. And the Green party are calling English votes for English laws “a cynical power grab by the Conservatives”. This is from a party spokeswoman. “English votes for English laws” is rightly seen as a rushed solution, designed to appease the core Tory vote unsettled by the questions thrown-up by the Scottish referendum debate. That is why the Green party are calling it for what it is: a cynical power grab by the Conservative party. The Scottish referendum shook the ground of politics in Britain yet the current proposals fail to address the fundamental issues raised during the campaign: voter disillusionment with business-as-usual Westminster politics and the democratic deficit that has emerged between parliament and the people. That’s why the Green party would push for whole-sale constitutional reform that includes greater powers for local and regional governments, total recall for MPs, a written constitution and electoral reform. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, has issued its response to the English votes for English laws proposals. While it is in favour in principle, it thinks Wales needs further devolution. This is from Jonathan Edwards, a Plaid MP. English votes for English laws seems reasonable. When considering the options put forward in the Command Paper, two key issues must be addressed. The first is whether Welsh MPs are prohibited from voting on English measures that will impact on the Welsh budget. Clearly this would be unjust. With this in mind, some of the options in the Command Paper are more problematic than others. Secondly, under any move towards English Votes for English Laws there will be a requirement to move towards a symmetrical devolution settlement where the four constituents parts of the British State have the same powers. Without this, English Votes for English Laws would be very difficult to enforce due to there being several tiers of MPs. Plaid Cymru believes in the simple principle of parity. By failing to address the mis-match between powers and funding in various parts of the UK, the Westminster parties are treating Wales as a second-class nation and will be judged for it at the ballot box in May. The Constitution Unit, a research group based at University College London, has also said that the government should not rush into English votes for English laws (Evel). This is from Professor Robert Hazell, its director. The hard liners who want a complete English veto are playing with fire. Given the complexities, this cries out for a gradualist approach. All four commissions which have looked at this have recommended a soft version of Evel: allowing a greater English voice, but not an English veto. A softer version also reduces the risk to the Speaker, who will have to rule on what is and what is not an English law. The technical difficulties and the political risks all point towards taking this gently, and initially trying EVEL out on an experimental basis. And this is from Professor Meg Russell, its deputy director. There’s a real risk that the two main parties use this serious question as a political football in the run-up to the general election, with each defending a position that suits their own electoral interests, and seeking to embarrass the other. But such a key matter about the future of the UK’s political system instead deserves cool-headed nonpartisan consideration - involving voices beyond the parties, and citizens themselves. Labour’s constitutional convention idea would do this, but not start for months, and be too wide-ranging. The government should open up an inclusive conversation, on an adequate timetable, starting now. The Electoral Reform Society has put out a statement saying, instead of having a vote on the English votes for English laws plans, the government should back a proper constitutional convention. This is from its chief executive, Katie Ghose. The government has presented a shopping list of solutions to the English Question, demonstrating that even within the coalition they cannot agree on which solution is best. But that’s not surprising – the chances of cross-party agreement on such a partisan issue are never going to be very high. In any case, trying to tackle a single constitutional issue in isolation is never going to answer all of the questions currently facing the UK, such as how power should be shared between the nations and regions, and to what extent power should be devolved to the local level. There is a better way to approach this problem, one which doesn’t involve politicians squabbling behind closed doors as they drift further and further away from the public. A constitutional convention, giving citizens the lead in determining where power should lie, is the only way to make sure the UK reaches a lasting and legitimate settlement. And it’s the only way to untangle some of the intractable problems surrounding the English Question without descending into partisan bickering. Four of the five largest UK-wide parties are signed up to a citizen-led constitutional convention to decide how the UK should be governed, including addressing the English Question. It’s time the Conservatives went beyond being ‘open’ to this idea and recognised the overwhelming support for giving citizens a say in where power should lie. This is what MPs are saying about William Hague’s plans on Twitter. From Labour MPs From Conservative MPs From Ukip This is what Hilary Benn, the shadow communities secretary, had to say about Hague’s plans on the World at One. Labour’s Wayne David asks what consultation Hague has carried out on how a bill would be designated English-only. Hague says the Speaker does not decide government policy. But, now the government has set out its ideas, he will consult John Bercow about how this could work. Stephen McCabe, the Labour MP, asks if the Speaker would decide whether a bill was English-only. Hague says it would have to be the Speaker, or some other impartial authority. It could be a panel of committee chairs. Asked how many bills in this parliament would be affected by these measures, Hague says “a great many”. That is because these procedures could be applied to parts of bills, not just whole bills, he says. Jason McCartney, a Conservative, says his constituents tell him that English votes for English laws is a matter of fairness. Labour’s Kevin Brennan says the Conservative party is morphing into an English nationalist party. Glyn Davies, a Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, says almost all healthcare for his constituency is delivered from England. He would be worried about not being allowed a vote on English health matters. Hague says at least one of the options in the command paper would allow non-English MPs to speak on these matters, and to vote at some stages. Here are some highlights from the Commons exchanges I missed while I was going through the command paper. (See 1.29pm.) There are four options for English votes for English laws (Evel) in the command paper. Largely they are what we expected (see 9.13am), but William Hague has already rejected the weakest model of Evel, the one proposed by the McKay Commission. Under all Hague’s plans English MPs would have an effective veto over English-only legislation. Here are the three Conservative options in the document. 1 - Banning Scottish MPs from voting on English-only laws. This is the most hardline option an this is what the document says about it. A Bill would be certified by the Speaker as applying to a particular part of the UK. Where it related only to England or England or Wales, the Bill would have its second reading in a Grand Committee, comprising all the MPs from the relevant nation(s). The Committee stage would be similarly restricted, and Report and Third Reading would be governed by a convention whereby MPs from other nations did not vote. Bills that dealt exclusively with English matters already devolved to the other nations would proceed entirely through an English-only process. Legislation that covered areas which were both devolved and reserved would need to pass through two parallel processes, one for each part of the bill. 2 Allowing English MPs the final say over the details of legislation. This is what the document says about this. Bills certified as relating solely to English, or English and Welsh matters, would pass as normal at Second Reading. The Committee Stage would be taken by those MPs only, in proportion to their party representation in the House of Commons. At Report stage the bill would be voted on by those MPs only At Third Reading the Bill would be voted on by the whole House. The command paper says this would give English MPs “the decisive say” over the content of English-only legislation. But in practice it looks like a veto, because bills cannot be amended at third reading. The House of Commons as a whole would have to decide whether to accept the changes proposed by English MPs, or to drop the whole legislation. 3 - Allowing English MPs a formal veto over English-only legislation. The command paper describes this as a “significantly strengthened” version of the McKay Commission proposals that would give English MPs an “effective veto” over English-only measures. It also makes it clear that this would involve English MPs having a veto over income tax rates (because this is a matter that will be devolved to Scotland). This is what the command paper says about this proposal. Second Reading would be taken as normal by all MPs. The Committee stages of English or English and Welsh only bills would be taken in Committee only by MPs from those countries, in proportion to their party representation in the House of Commons. This procedure would also apply to the English or English and Welsh parts of bills that contained both English or English and Welsh only clauses, and UK wide clauses. Report Stage would be taken as normal by all MPs An English Grand Committee would then vote after Report stage but prior to Third Reading, on a Legislative Consent Motion. English or English and Welsh MPs would therefore be able to grant their consent or veto a bill, or relevant parts of it. Such decisions would have the same status as those of the Scottish Parliament on devolved matters. A bill could not pass to Third Reading without passing the legislative consent vote. Third Reading would be taken as normal by all MPs, but only if the legislative consent motion was passed. The English Grand Committee could have other functions, including determining the distribution of expenditure within England, such as local government finance or police grants, and it could also have additional questions to Ministers in departments with English only functions. The principle of requiring consent from an English Grand Committee could be applied to levels of taxation and welfare benefits where the equivalent rates have been devolved to Scotland or elsewhere. And this is the Lib Dem proposal. 4 - Allowing English MPs a veto over English- only bills - with English MPs voting on a proportional basis. This is what the command paper says about this. The Liberal Democrat starting point is that for measures which unambiguously affect England only and which are not devolved below the Westminster level, there should be a new parliamentary stage before third reading or equivalent, composed of MPs proportionately representing the votes cast in England to allow them to scrutinise proposals and to employ a veto if they so wish. Here is the 34-page command paper, The Implications of Devolution for England (pdf). John Redwood, the Conservative, says England wants “simplicity and justice” now. Will Hague speak up for England? Hague says that he hopes he is speaking for England, and for the whole of the UK. Hague is replying to Khan. He says the idea that Labour is leading the debate on this is risible. For 13 years Labour did not give extra powers to the cities and towns of England. He says he has discussed the government’s devolution plans with the leaders of Labour councils in England. Labour’s frontbench is out of touch with these leaders. Labour has achieved the feat of being out of touch with themselves, he says. Hague says the McKay Commission produced a range of options. But, since further devolution is taking place, is it necessary to have something stronger and more binding. That is why the Conservatives and the Lib Dems are both proposing binding legislative consent motions. Hague says the government is “open to ideas” on a constitutional convention. No one is arguing that the work of the Smith Commission should be delayed while a constitution convention is held. And, similarly, the English reforms should not be held up while a constitutional convention is held. Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, is responding for Labour. He says the party favours the approach to this set out in the McKay Commission report. Does the government support Labour’s plans to devolve spending to the regions? Does the government support the case for an elected House of Lords. There should be no room for stitch-ups, he says. Hague has finished his statement. I will post the full details of his proposals when I see the text of the statement, or the command paper. But it is striking that all three of the options the Conservatives are backing are stronger than the plans proposed in the McKay Commission. Hague says devolution has created the situation that allows MPs from outside England to vote on English matters, while English MPs cannot vote on matters outside England. This is the so-called West Lothian Question. Both coalition parties agree it is an issue, he says. The Lib Dems want English MPs at Westminster to have a veto over English-only issues. Their preferred method for this would involve the single transferable vote. But there is no support for this, so they want members of an English grand committee to be selected proportionately. Hague says the Conservative still believe that equalised constituency sizes is necessary. He says the Conservatives have set out three plans for English votes for English laws. All three are stronger than the plans in the McKay Commission report. The first one would stop Scottish MPs voting on English-only bills. The advantage of this plan is its simplicity. There would be no need for a change to the procedure for dealing with bills. The second plan would involve only English MPs voting on the amending stages of a bill. This idea was proposed by a commission chaired by Ken Clarke before 2010. The third plan would involve English MPs voting on English-only matters at an early stage of a bill’s passage through parliament, as well as giving them a veto at a later stage. Whatever option is accepted must produce fairness for the whole of the UK, he says. Hague says the government supports localism, but it should not be a way of imposing new taxes. And Westminster should remain the law-making body for England, he says. Hague says there have already been significant changes in England, including elected mayors and combined metro authorities. The government has also produced plans for a Northern powerhouse. This represents the biggest attempt to devolve power to northern England for decades. William Hague is making his statement now. On 19 September David Cameron announced the Smith Commission, to take forward devolution to Scotland. Draft legislation for that will be ready by 25 January, he says. Hague says the government wants to give the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland more say over their affairs too. The Welsh secretary is pushing forward plans to extend devolution to Wales. And the Northern Ireland secretary is pushing ideas for Northern Ireland, including the devolution of corporation tax. Hague says today he is publishing plans for England. Labour refused to cooperate. The talks in Scotland and Wales have been on a cross-party basis. But it is only in England that Labour refuses to take a cross-party approach. Steve Norris, the Conservative former transport minister, has used Twitter to express his support for English votes for English laws. William Hague, the leader of the Commons, is making his statement about English votes for English laws shortly. But that is not quite how he is phrasing it. The paper he is publishing is called “The Implications of Devolution for England”. Lord Prescott, the Labour former deputy prime minister, has accused William Hague, the leader of the Commons, of a stitch-up by trying to rush through reforms that will restrict the rights of non-English MPs to vote in the House on exclusively English matters. Hague will be unveiling his plans at 12.30pm. I will be covering his statement in detail. UK inflation fell to its lowest level in 12 years in November as a sharp drop in oil prices triggered falls at the petrol pump and provided some relief for cash-strapped British households, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. Ofcom has appointed Sharon White, a senior Treasury official overseeing the UK’s spending cuts, as its new chief executive. Labour has criticised some Lib Dem MPs for backing a government motion defending cuts to firefighters’ pensions after they signed a Labour motion opposing the proposals. The vote took place yesterday, and Labour’s bid to stop the reforms was defeated by 313 votes to 261 - a majority of 52. Afterwards Labour pointed out that some of the Lib Dems who signed its early day motion opposing the plans abstained, or voted with the government. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today’s paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here’s the PoliticsHome list of top 10 politics articles, and here’s the ConservativeHome round-up of all today’s politics stories. And here are two stories I found particularly interesting. The Times (paywall) says David Cameron is heading for a confrontation with Conservative backbenchers over his plans for English votes for English laws. David Cameron is heading for a confrontation with his own party within days when he announces proposals to limit the power of Scottish MPs. Conservative MPs warned the prime minister last night that they would accept nothing less than an outright ban on Scottish MPs voting on English issues ... Mr Redwood said that a majority of Conservative MPs and most voters wanted an outright ban to balance the “lopsided” constitution. “Anything else would be insupportable,” he said. Ben Riley-Smith in the Daily Telegraph says Lucy Powell, Labour’s election campaign vice chair, is being blamed for producing the document saying immigration isn’t a top vote-winner for the party. One of Ed Miliband’s closest advisers has been identified as the person who approved a controversial document advising Labour MPs not to engage with voters on the subject of immigration. Lucy Powell, vice-chair of the general election campaign, allowed the document revealed by The Telegraph to be sent to dozens of MPs which yesterday threatened to undermine Mr Miliband’s attempts to claim Labour was getting tough on immigration. The “incandescent” shadow cabinet rounded on Mr Miliband privately as he was forced to distance himself from the controversial 33-page memo by openly criticising the official Labour Party advice. Frank Field, the Labour MP, has criticised Labour’s policy on English votes for English laws. The voters recognise weasel words when they hear them. Labour’s offer of a major constitutional convention is a not very skilful attempt to kill the debate until after the votes are counted. This issue, once lost in the long grass, is where, I suspect, Labour will wish to keep it. But Labour has to accept the truth that the bonus that is gained from having Scottish MPs added to the English parliament now has a sell- by-date put on it by the Scottish voters themselves. In an article for Standpoint magazine, which is not available on the web yet, he proposes a fully federal constitutional settlement for the UK - with England getting its own parliament. An English assembly or parliament is the only way I see of answering Tam’s West Lothian Question in a manner that re-establishes equity amongst the four countries of the United Kingdom. Each assembly—for England, Wales and Northern Ireland— should have the powers that have been, or are about to be granted to the Scottish Parliament. The remaining functions would be reserved for a senate (which would replace the present House of Lords). Foreign affairs, defence and the remaining Exchequer pow- ers would be exercised by a senate common to all four nations. This senate, I suggest, should be made up of two types of members. Two hundred and fifty or so would be elected by the voters from new sen- ate constituencies based on between six and seven current parlia- mentary or, as they would be called, assembly constituencies. Each one of these senate constituencies would return a senator. Whether they should be elected on a first-past-the-post principle, or on some other form of proportional representation, should be the basis for further debate. What must be ruled out from the outset would be the current system for EU elections, where the party hierarchy de- cides the order in which the candidates are elected, with voters re- stricted to a choice of voting for a political party but never a person. We must be able to elect our senators and they must be accountable to a known electorate and be known to that electorate. On Twitter the Conservative MP Michael Fabricant says he supports the most hardline of the four version of English votes for English laws on offer. (See 9.13am.) According to the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman, some Tory MPs are meeting this morning to plan how they heckle Labour during this afternoon’s statement on English votes for English laws. YouGov released some figures two months ago showing what people think about English votes for English laws. The good news for the Tories is that people favour banning Scottish MPs from voting on English-only matters. But the bad news is that they don’t regard this as a priority. The cause of stripping Scottish MPs of some of their voting rights seems to be popular. A YouGov survey at the time of the recent referendum found that 72% of English electors want them banned from voting on England-only issues. Indeed 55% would go even further, and so something that no English politician has proposed: stop Scottish MPs from voting on tax and spending decisions. Yet any party that made a big fuss about this might find the cause not so attractive after all. The danger emerges clearly from the YouGov/Prospect poll. We gave people a list of 18 things that Britain’s government could do over the next few years, and asked them “which four or five do you think are most important?” Despite all the publicity for the issue, and the apparent support for change, curbing the voting rights of Scottish MPs comes half way down the list. Just 23% regard it as one of the main priorities, a long way behind tighter immigration rules, spending more on the NHS, holding down energy prices and increasing the minimum wage. And here’s a comment on the inflation figures from Cathy Jamieson, a shadow Treasury minister.. These figures show that plummeting global oil prices have led to the rate of inflation falling here in Britain But wages continue to be sluggish, barely keeping up with rising prices. The latest figures show total pay up by just 1 per cent - the same as today’s CPI figure - and pay excluding bonuses up just 1.3 per cent. While the Tories deny there is a cost-of-living crisis, the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are on average £1600 a year worse off. Labour’s economic plan will ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top. Our plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and for more good jobs is also a key part of our tough but balanced plan to get the deficit down. Here’s George Osborne, the chancellor, on the inflation figures. And here’s a comment from Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Falling oil prices have helped push inflation to its lowest level since 2002. This is a welcome early Christmas present to millions of families across the country. And, as the Liberal Democrat Treasury minister, I am determined that the continuing oil price falls will be passed on to consumers as quickly as possible and in full. It has been confirmed that William Hague is giving a statement to MPs at 12.30pm about English votes for English laws. Here is the start of the Press Association story about the inflation figures. Inflation fell sharply to a 12-year low of 1% in November as lower food and petrol prices kept a lid on the cost of living. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation dropped more steeply than expected from 1.3% in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It means Bank of England governor Mark Carney only just avoids having to write to chancellor George Osborne to explain why inflation is more than 1% off its 2% target. But the continuing slide in oil prices is expected to feed through to a further drop in CPI. Carney has already acknowledged that he is likely to have to write to Osborne in the coming months. CPI has not been as low since September 2002 and was last lower in June 2002. It has now been at or below the 2% target for 12 months in a row. November’s figures showed food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.7% on last year, the steepest drop since June 2002. Prices in this sector have been falling year on year for five months in a row - the longest such stretch since 2000 - amid fierce competition between supermarkets under pressure from Aldi and Lidl. Motor fuel fell 5.9% as average petrol prices dropped by 3p per litre over the month and diesel fell 2.9p, both steeper falls than the same month last year. It comes as oil prices have sunk to a five-year low. Here are the headline inflation figures. The rate of consumer price index (CPI) inflation fell to a 12-year low of 1% in November from 1.3% in October. The rate of retail price index (RPI) inflation fell to a five-year low of 2% from 2.3% the previous month. Here is the Office for National Statistics news release. And here is the statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf). For the record, here are today’s YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 34% (up 2 from YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 32% (no change) Ukip: 14% (down 2) Greens: 8% (up 1) Lib Dems: 6% (down 1) Labour lead: 2 points (up 2) Government approval: -24 (no change) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 14. And Labour’s Graham Allen, chair of the Commons political and constitutional reform committee, has also criticised the government’s plans. He said the government should be pushing ahead with proper devolution for England. The Hague Cabinet committee set up to look at the consequences of the Scottish referendum has instead focused on one tiny Westminster issue and deliberately missed the opportunity to bring planned devolution to England ... Government sees Parliament’s role as delivering for Whitehall not championing devolution to the localities of England. Our politics is broken, it needs fixing. This is a moment for political leadership, not complacency and business as usual. Focusing on one partisan issue and ignoring the wider historic opportunities smacks of rearranging the green benches on the deck of the Titanic. On Radio 4’s Today Lord Prescott, the Labour former deputy prime minister, described the government’s English votes for English laws plans as a “stitch-up”. This is a stitch-up. They can’t get an agreement about it. They are rushing it before the election to make an election claim - English parliament for English MPs. You can’t divorce England from the rest and make the English parliament a central English parliament without proper accountability to the people as we have given in Scotland, as we have given in Wales and have given in Northern Ireland. In the interview he also mis-spoke at one point and called Ed Miliband “Red Ed” by mistake. UPDATE AT 9.42AM: Listening to the tape again, it seems clear that Prescott calling Miliband “Red Ed” was a case of him mangling his words, and not intentional. I’ve amended the sentence above to make that clear. You can listen to it here. Early on Friday 19 September, shortly after it had been confirmed that Scotland had voted to reject independence, David Cameron announced in a statement from Number 10 that he now wanted a better constitutional settlement for England too and that he would stop English MPs being over-ruled on English-only matters by Scottish MPs. In other words, he was going to push ahead with English votes for English laws, or Evel, to use its horrible acronym. As Nicholas Watt, Severin Carrell and Patrick Wintour reveal today, in the first instalment of their account of the inside story of the independence campaign (it’s excellent), Alistair Darling told Cameron in advance this would be a mistake. Today we’re going to get a paper outlining the government’s plans. But the initiative has already been hit by problems. William Hague, the leader of the Commons, had to abandon plans to stage a vote on this before the end of November and the coalition parties still can’t agree on what should happen. As a result today’s document is expected to contain four alternative versions of Evel. In broad terms, this is what they are: 1 - Banning Scottish MPs from voting on English-only laws. This is the most hardline option. 2 - Allowing all MPs to vote on English-only legislation, but ensuring the English-only parts can pass if they are approved by English-only MPs. This would effectively give English MPs a veto over English-only proposals. 3 - Allowing English MPs to vote on English-only matters, but giving the final say to the whole House of Commons. This proposal, which was recommended last year by a government commission chaired by Sir William McKay, is intended to ensure that, where there is a disagreement between the English MPs and the House as a whole, a compromise has to be reached. Labour has recently adopted a version of this. 4 - Allowing a grand committee of English MPs to vote on English-only matters, with its members selected on a proportionate basis to reflect vote share at the election. This is the Lib Dem option. Hague is expected to make a statement about this to MPs at 12.30pm. I will be covering that in detail. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Inflation figures are released. 12.30am: William Hague is expected to make a statement to MPs about the government’s English votes for English laws plans. Around 1.30pm: Steve Webb, the pensions minister, is expected to make a Commons statement about Post Office card accounts. 3.15pm: Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, gives evidence to the Scottish affairs committee about the Smith Commission. 4pm: David Cameron gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee about climate change and radicalisation. As usual, I will be also covering all the breaking political news from Westminster, as well as bringing you the most interesting political comment and analysis from the web and from Twitter. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.

A class action suit involving 800 plaintiffs was filed Monday demanding that the government and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which operated the Dai-ichi facility, restore the natural environment and people's homes to their pre-disaster state. The Fukushima site remains one of the most radioactive places on earth, and the devilishly difficult cleanup there is expected to take 40-plus years and cost tens of billions of dollars. Some 160,000 evacuees still live in temporary housing, having lost their livelihoods and land to the contamination, which may render some of it unfarmable for centuries to come. In response to the accident, Japanese authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants, a popular move in a country that lost two of its cities to atomic bombs at the end of the last World War, and where anti-nuclear sentiments run deep. But in the face of power shortages and mounting industry pressure, oil and coal-poor Japan, has begun re-opening its closed nuclear facilities and plans to restart six more reactors by the end of 2013. The pro-nuclear government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, has even talked about building new plants. This gradual return to business as usual has led some to question how much has been learned from Fukushima. Not much, if one believes a commentary published in Bloomberg View on Sunday which trumpets, \"Fukushima Radiation Proves Less Deadly Than Feared\". Professor Robert Peter Gale and author Eric Lax argue that more people die from air pollution created by oil and coal-fired power plants than from radiation released during nuclear accidents. Their takeaway from the second largest nuclear accident in history (after Chernobyl) is that outside of the badly contaminated plant site and the temporary dislocation of the area's residents, not much harm was done. Public \"fears of health risks from radiation,\" they concluded, \"have little basis in fact.\" The Japanese government has also been eager to play down Fukushima's impact. Critics charge that after the accident the authorities were slow to extend the narrow exclusion zone around Fukushima, and withheld critical information about contamination levels, which delayed the evacuation. The New York Times reported: \"After the nuclear disaster, the government raised the legal exposure limit to radiation from one to 20 millisieverts a year for people, including children — effectively allowing them to continue living in communities from which they would have been barred under the old standard.\" The truth is that nobody can say yet what the effect are of the Fukushima accident on public health in Japan and beyond. Typically, chronic illnesses, like cancer and Leukemia which are associated with radiation, take several years after exposure to appear. But a report released in late January gives early cause for concern. The Fukushima Prefecture Health Management Survey revealed that 44.2% of 94,975 children tested by ultrasound had small thyroid nodules and cysts, which may in some cases be a precursor of cancer. The number of abnormalities has been increasing over the past two years that the surveys have been conducted. Scientists at Stanford University estimated that the radiation from the meltdown might result in – at the upper limit – as many as 2,500 additional cancer cases (mostly in Japan) and 1,300 cancer deaths globally. Last year's study, which used 3D global atmospheric modeling, predicted that the impact would have been ten times greater if the prevailing winds had not swept most of the radiation relatively harmlessly out to sea. \"There was a lot of luck involved,\" said Mark Z. Jacobson, co-author of the report. Should America be depending on luck to protect us from potential future Fukushimas? Not according to Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Lyman told me that after Fukushima, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) set up a task force to identify the lessons the US should learn from the accident. The task force recommended, among other things, that nuclear plants should upgrade their ability to deal with extended power outages, such as occurred at Fukushima, without their reactor cores melting down. But the nuclear industry balked at the proposed new NRC regulations and proposed its own voluntary program dubbed \"FLEX\" (Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies) instead. Lyman says that FLEX, which involves purchasing more reliable equipment, and sprucing up emergency backup systems, is a step in the right direction. But he believes that it is not nearly as stringent as it needs to be to prevent future Fukushimas. The nuclear industry is lobbying the NRC to accept the FLEX programs \"half measures,\" according to Lyman, in lieu of the tough new regulations that its own task force devised. And there is growing pressure from Congress to comply. Michigan Republican Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy Committee, whose biggest campaign contributors include several nuclear and electric industry pacs, is one of the leaders of the move to get regulators to sign off on the industry plan. Ironically, Upton's district includes the Palisades nuclear power plant located on the shores of Lake Michigan, an aging facility that has been notorious for a series of shutdowns, leaks, and equipment failures in recent years. The facility suffered three \"near misses\" in the past three years. In a scathing report issued late last year on the NRCs regulatory failures, the UCS says that a cooling water leakage at Palisades was allowed to continue for nearly a month in a critical location where regulations require the plant to be shut down within six hours. The report goes on to allege that, \"the NRC routinely allows violations of this type to go unpenalized, thus enabling poor decision-making by plant owners.\" With few new nuclear plants being built at present, America's nuclear infrastructure continues to age and grow increasingly more accident-prone. Spent fuel rods also accumulate and pose unaddressed safety risks. Many plants are located along rivers or coastlines, where they face dangers from flooding. Others are in areas prone to earthquakes, like the one that initiated the Fukushima meltdown. One hundred and eleven million Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant. So far they have been lucky. Nobody can say how long that luck will last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theobserver/2013/dec/29/letters-welfare-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-29T00:05:52Z","webTitle":"The latest welfare reforms are intellectually bankrupt | letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/29/letters-welfare-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2013/dec/29/letters-welfare-reforms","fields":{"headline":"The latest welfare reforms are intellectually bankrupt","bodyText":"To avoid facing up to the damage their policies are inflicting on some of the most vulnerable people in society, the DWP argues that because the Trussell Trust is opening new food banks \"it's not surprising more people are using them\" (\"Charities condemn IDS for food bank snub\", News).

John Hurdley Birmingham Profumo didn't topple premier In her review of Stephen Ward (Critics, last week) Susannah Clapp is the latest to blame the \"nonsense\" of the Profumo affair for \"the collapse of Macmillan's government\". The affair undermined the reputation of Harold Macmillan as a leader and of the Conservative government he led but his premiership ended when he resigned believing (wrongly he later felt) that he could not continue as prime minister after a prostate operation. The comments are perhaps meant more loosely, arguing that Profumo contributed significantly to election defeat for Alec Douglas-Home's Conservatives a year later in 1964. Even this seems thin as Home was only narrowly defeated by Harold Wilson's Labour party. History has already been re-written as far as the 1966 election is concerned. Wilson, it is said, rode to victory on the outpouring of euphoria as a consequence of England's victory in the World Cup final. Actually the election was held before England lifted the trophy.

Two consortiums led by Balfour Beatty and Laing O'Rourke were hoping to have heard about the huge deal in recent days but now expect no decision until 2013 at the earliest. The move is a blow to employment prospects in the area and comes weeks after £100m worth of site preparation was postponed. The soonest a new reactor will be built in Somerset could now be 2021, around four years later than originally hoped. EDF declined to comment on the latest setback, with a spokesman for the 83% state-owned French power company saying: \"I am afraid it is not our practice to comment on open tenders.\" The group insisted that its wider plans remained intact and it aimed to start work on the £100m contract, which was awarded last year to construction partner Kier Bam, \"as soon as practicable, and all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that work can start in good time\". EDF says it still plans to go ahead with new reactors in Britain but industry experts say uncertainty over the government's planned support mechanism through \"contracts for difference\" and the election of President François Hollande, who is sceptical about nuclear power, have encouraged EDF to slam on the brakes. John Stanion, chief executive and chairman of construction firm Vinci, a partner to Balfour Beatty, told the industry newspaper Construction News that the £1.2bn contract was unlikely to be awarded until next year. \"I think EDF is totally committed to Hinkley Point subject to them having a clear investment case, but I don't think it is in a position to make a decision until [the contracts are] legally brought into force, so some time next year will be the earliest they will commit.\" The use of contracts for difference to ensure investment in low-carbon technology through guaranteeing a certain power price was confirmed in the energy bill published by the government last week. But energy companies have made clear they will need to see the exact scale of the financial support before they can commit themselves to new plants, especially nuclear ones. Other power companies such as E.ON, RWE and SSE have already dropped plans for new reactors in Britain. There has already been speculation that EDF's original price of building new stations has risen from £4bn to £7bn. The French company will not confirm that. EDF said it was making \"good progress\" on site preparation at Hinkley Point after winning approval from West Somerset council in February. Meanwhile, investment in wind and other renewable energy is also stuttering. Spending during the first quarter of the year dropped to its lowest since 2009, according to Ernst &amp; Young's latest quarterly global renewable energy Country Attractiveness Indices report. Britain dropped from fifth to sixth place in the global rankings due to new uncertainties surrounding government policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/24/rio-tintos-stance-on-kakadu-cleanup-alarms-indigenous-owners","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-24T06:05:30Z","webTitle":"Rio Tinto's stance on Kakadu cleanup alarms Indigenous owners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/24/rio-tintos-stance-on-kakadu-cleanup-alarms-indigenous-owners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/24/rio-tintos-stance-on-kakadu-cleanup-alarms-indigenous-owners","fields":{"headline":"Rio Tinto's stance on Kakadu cleanup alarms Indigenous owners","bodyText":"It’s a long way from central London to Kakadu national park in Australia's Northern Territory. When Rio Tinto's chief executive, Sam Walsh, addressed shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting last week, there was a strong sense of the distance. Walsh refused to offer any guarantees that the mining giant would help its Australian subsidiary company Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) clean up the site of its Ranger uranium mine within the park. \"This is a public Australian company and clearly that is an issue for them,\" Walsh said. When pressed on the point he added: \"We are clearly shareholders, but it is a matter for all shareholders and a matter for the ERA board.\" The Ranger mine was in the news in December last year when a leach tank containing 1.4m litres of acidic radioactive slurry leaked. Walsh’s words were alarming for Mirarr traditional owners who live in the park and are no strangers to negotiating with mining companies. They are anxious about ERA's commitment to the rehabilitation of the site. ERA is obliged to ensure it is fit to be be reincorporated into the park by 2026. The traditional owners fear that if Rio Tinto won't take responsibility for the site, no one will. The ERA share price has recovered after a dramatic drop after the spill (its shares lost 30% in the first three days after it happened), but uranium prices globally are very low. Market confidence has remained poor since the Fukushima disaster, and there have been other blows, such as Germany getting out of nuclear power altogether. ERA has its sights set on massive expansion plans. It wants to press ahead with a new underground uranium exploration alongside Ranger called Ranger 3 Deeps. The underground uranium deposit contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, making it one of the world’s most significant recent uranium discoveries. And in ERA's 2013 annual report was a condition that was already troubling the Mirarr: “If the Ranger 3 Deeps mine is not developed, in the absence of any other successful development, ERA may require an additional source of funding to fully fund the rehabilitation of the Ranger project area.” At the Rio Tinto AGM, Andy Whitmore, an activist shareholder, asked Walsh to clarify whether the leak at Ranger had affected the company’s expansion plans and whether it would affect its ability to rehabilitate the mine site by 2026. Walsh said: “There was a rights issue at ERA to fund the rehabilitation work and those funds are still sitting within that business.” According to ERA's investor statement from October 2011 the majority of the $500m raised from the rights issue is earmarked for a “brine concentrator and other water management initiatives” and “the construction of the Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline”. The concern is that the money might not be enough. Certainly, Walsh's response did not quell Whitmore’s anxieties. “I don't think this is going to satisfy the local community,” Whitmore said. The Australian government has been aware of huge uranium deposits in Kakadu national park since the Whitlam government initiated the Ranger environmental inquiry (Fox report) in 1975. When the Fraser government passed the 1976 Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act granting land rights over Kakadu to traditional wwners, the Mirarr were singled out to be denied veto rights over mining. But when the Howard government lifted Australia's “three mine” policy in 1996, the Mirarr vehemently opposed ERA's plans for a new uranium mine at Jabiluka, also inside Kakadu national park. The Jabiluka blockade, which drew more than 5,000 activists to the mine site 230km east of Darwin, became an international lightning rod for land rights and Indigenous cultural rights internationally. When Rio Tinto became the majority (68%) shareholder in ERA in August 2000, faced with mounting international pressure, in 2002 its chairman Sir Robert Wilson declared that Jabiluka would never be developed without the consent of the Mirarr. But fast forward from that apparent victory to 2014 and, according to Justin O'Brien, chief executive of the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, “This is sadly a case of taking a few steps forward and many steps back.” O'Brien says for ERA to make the cleanup of the Ranger site conditional on approval for 3 Deeps would amount to holding the traditional owners to ransom. “We urgently want clarity from the Australian government and from ERA and Rio Tinto on this that our fears are unfounded. Those fears are that we'll be left with a toxic radioactive legacy from Ranger, and that there's nobody with pockets deep enough to fund the cleanup,” he said. “In December last year we had this catastrophic failure of a leach tank when 1.4m litres of a toxic slurry escaped. The response from ERA was that none of it had interacted with the environment until we proved it had leaked on to the grass. There were other examples of non-disclosure of tardy maintenance systems that just don't augur well for a good relationship.” While not directly responding to O'Brien's allegations about its disclosures relating to the spill, a spokesman from ERA told Guardian Australia the company was undertaking “progressive rehabilitation” at Ranger, including backfilling an opencut mine with 27m tonnes of material. ERA told the Guardian that “the cleanup from the spill is complete” and said it had a business plan to complete rehabilitation of the overall site. “ERA's long-term business plan is to ensure that the business can meet its rehabilitation obligations. Ongoing monitoring since the leach tank failure has confirmed that the surrounding area has not been affected and that ERA's containment systems worked to design, with no impact on Kakadu national park,” the spokesman said. He insisted that the section of the annual report about the need for an additional source of funding for rehabilitation referred to “potential business risk”. At ERA’s AGM this month in Darwin, its chief executive, Andrea Sutton, acknowledged that the Ranger spill had damaged relations with traditional owners. “This is an important relationship to ERA and while there is no doubt that the leach tank incident interrupted our engagement with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, we do continue to engage on a range of matters of mutual interest,” she said. Sutton also downplayed the environmental impact of the spill. “With the leach tank incident in December there were questions raised about our environmental performance. Ongoing monitoring has confirmed that the surrounding area has not been affected and that there has been no impact on Kakadu national park.” But a government-commissioned inquiry into the impact of the spill continues. The Department of Environment said: “Geoscience Australia has been commissioned by the Supervising Scientist to conduct an investigation into possible impacts to groundwater as a result of the spill and ERA is conducting additional groundwater sampling in accordance with their recommendations.” The office of the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, office told Guardian Australia the investigation would 'take as long as is necessary' to ensure it is comprehensive and considers all relevant issues: “Prior to that process being completed it would be inappropriate to comment further on the cause of the incident or speculate on the outcomes of the investigation.” O'Brien acknowledges that on current evidence it appears that the majority of the spill was contained on the mine site, but suggests ERA should wait for the results of the government inquiry to be tabled before pushing ahead with its plans for 3 Deeps. “The mining giants have made enormous profits at the expense of Mirarr traditional lands,” he said, “and they are now holding the word heritage-listed area to ransom. It’s just utterly unacceptable that you mine Australia's largest national park, the jewel in its world heritage crown, and don't make sufficient provision to clean up your radiological mess.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jul/29/hinkley-c-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-29T17:21:03Z","webTitle":"Hinckley C nuclear power station: a good thing? | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/29/hinkley-c-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/29/hinkley-c-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hinckley C nuclear power station: a good thing?","bodyText":"This week French state-owned power company EDF was given permission to start the preconstruction of \"Hinkley C\", the third nuclear power station on the Somerset coast of the Bristol channel and what is expected to be the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain in over 20 years. This will involve clearing over 400 acres of land and excavating more soil and rock than was dug up for the London Olympic Games. Is this good for Britain? Nuclear is considered by the government to be an entirely safe, cheap and predictable electricity source, ideally suited to work in conjunction with less predictable wind power to provide the 80% of low-carbon electricity that Britain must generate by 2050 to meet its ambitious statutory climate targets. What are the pros and cons? Hinckley is one of eight sites now earmarked for a new generation of nuclear power stations. All are sited next to existing stations, which means there is an available workforce and less opposition from local communities who have come to depend on nuclear power for jobs and income. Hinckley C, and a twin station at Sizewell in Suffolk, if built should each provide around 1,600MW of electricity from third-generation, twin-unit European pressurised reactors (EPR). Prototypes for these stations are being built in Flammanville in France and at Olkiluoto in Finland. Are they really cheap? Both the French and the Finnish prototype stations have doubled in price to around £6bn each and are taking twice as long – six years – to construct than expected. Hinckley C was intended to be generating electricity by 2018, but this is now considered unlikely. No commercial nuclear plant has ever been built in Britain on time or at the anticipated cost and City analysts do not think EDF will be able to construct nuclear plants any more cheaply in Britain than elsewhere. Nuclear critics argue that the climate targets can be met with renewables and that nuclear's costs have been distorted because companies do not have to pay for insurance, or storing the waste for thousands of years. In addition, they say that costs may rise further because of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, which raised safety questions in all nuclear power stations. Nuclear advocates say that only nuclear can now provide the quantity of energy needed for the next 40 years. But its critics point to Germany, Italy, Switzerland and possibly Japan, which have turned their back on the much-disputed power source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/12/french-fukushima-cartoon-offends-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-12T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"French Fukushima cartoon offends Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/french-fukushima-cartoon-offends-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/french-fukushima-cartoon-offends-japan","fields":{"headline":"French Fukushima cartoon offends Japan","bodyText":"Japan is to lodge an official complaint about a cartoon in a French newspaper that links the Fukushima nuclear disaster with Tokyo's successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics. The cartoon, which appeared on Wednesday in the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchainé, shows two sumo wrestlers – each with an extra arm or leg – with the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the background. At the edge of the panel, a TV announcer dressed in a hazardous materials suit says: \"Marvellous! Thanks to Fukushima, sumo is now an Olympic sport.\" A second image features two people in protective clothing conducting radiation tests by the side of a pool, along with the caption: \"There is already a pool in Fukushima for the Olympics.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 2020 Games to Tokyo last weekend, despite growing concerns about the safety of the Fukushima plant. In the runup to the IOC vote, reports emerged of leaks of highly contaminated water from storage tanks at the plant. In a separate incident last month, the facility's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, admitted that about 300 tonnes of radioactive groundwater a day was flowing into the Pacific. Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered personal assurances to IOC officials that the Fukushima plant was under control and that radiation leaks posed no threat to Tokyo. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said a formal complaint would be lodged with the French embassy in Tokyo, adding that the cartoon hurt the victims of the triple disaster that struck Japan's north-east coast on 11 March 2011. \"It is inappropriate and gives the wrong impression about the issue of contaminated water at Fukushima Daiichi,\" Suga said. \"It is extremely regrettable.\" Japan's foreign ministry has been ordered to step up efforts to provide timely and accurate information about the situation in Fukushima, amid criticism from South Korea and China that it has been slow to share details about the water leaks. This is not the first time that France – where nuclear is the primary source of energy – has offended Japanese sensibilities over Fukushima. Last October the broadcaster France 2 apologised after it screened a composite picture of the Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima with four arms.

In the 1987 general election, McGrady seized the hitherto safe unionist seat from the Ulster Unionist party, which had parachuted Enoch Powell, the controversial Conservative figure, into the constituency after he decided not to stand for re-election to his Westminster seat in 1974. The defeat effectively brought an end to Powell's political career. McGrady held the seat for 23 years until 2010. McGrady had been a committed and influential SDLP stalwart from the party's earliest days. In 1970, as the Northern Ireland Troubles escalated, Gerry Fitt, John Hume and others associated with the civil rights campaign banded together to form a new grouping that they called the SDLP, to pursue their demands, democratically and peacefully, in both the Northern Ireland parliament at Stormont and at Westminster. McGrady, who was then a local councillor in his native Downpatrick, abandoned the ramshackle National Democratic party and joined the fledgling SDLP, becoming its first chairman in 1971. For the rest of his political career, he was at the heart of the party's counsels as it coped with the effects of sustained terrorist violence, and led the drive for peace and political stability. The son of a draper, McGrady was one of 11 children. After education at St Patrick's grammar school in Downpatrick, he gained chartered accountancy qualifications and set up his own practice and insurance brokerage. From this community base he established local political influence, serving on both the Down urban and district councils. For nationalists, the SDLP emerged as a counterpoint to the surging IRA violence, after the suspension of the Northern Ireland parliament in 1972. McGrady was on the crest of the political wave that brought the SDLP into the groundbreaking power-sharing administration at Stormont, forged by the 1973 Sunningdale agreement. Even though he was a political novice, McGrady was appointed to a ministerial post as head of planning and co-ordination. The position was short-lived, as the new government was brought down after only five months by a general strike organised by unionist and loyalist hardliners. Despite this monumental setback, McGrady remained a key SDLP figure through the frustrations of several unsuccessful political initiatives in subsequent years, serving in various senior but unglamorous background party posts. His commitment to politics was severely tested by general election defeats in 1979, 1983 and 1986, before he at last ousted Powell. There was also a significant personal cost, as he and his family were subject to violent threats and intimidation. There followed many more years in the political wilderness until prolonged negotiations in Belfast, Dublin and London resulted in the 1994 terrorist ceasefires and, subsequently, the 1998 Good Friday agreement. McGrady remained at the heart of these often secret negotiations and took a prominent place at the news conferences where the triumphs were finally celebrated. He undertook a large volume of constituency work and served on the Northern Ireland affairs committee at Westminster. He generally preferred to work quietly for his causes and constituents, but he waged one notable and sustained public campaign against nuclear power – the Sellafield site in Cumbria, he passionately believed, posed a real danger to his South Down constituents and he was vigorously opposed to a proposed expansion. For four years from 2001, McGrady served on the Northern Ireland Policing Board as it supervised the transition from the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. After the death of his wife, Patricia, in 2003, and a steady deterioration in his health, McGrady retired from Westminster in 2010. He is survived by two sons, Jerry and Conaill, and a daughter, Paula. • Edward Kevin McGrady, politician, born 3 June 1935; died 11 November 2013 • This article was amended on 15 November 2013.

Amid repeated speculation that the Beijing-based CGNP might become an investor in EDF's potential new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, the new deal made specific mention of \"co-operation in future international projects\". EDF declined to comment on whether the CGNP could replace Centrica, which withdrew from the Hinkley project in February, saying it needed to complete negotiations with the British government on financial support first. \"We are still in discussions [with the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Treasury] over contracts for difference and a successful conclusion is the key to looking for new future investors,\" said an EDF spokesman. EDF originally hoped to press the button on a new generation of nuclear reactors in Britain before the end of last year but talks with the government have become increasingly fraught with no breakthrough in sight. The firm has seen the cost of other newbuild projects soar through delays and technical hitches and wants to insulate itself against risks at Hinkley by obtaining commitments from Britain to pay more than £100 a megawatt hour for up to 40 years. The government, which has promised there would be no subsidies for new nuclear power stations, is determined to keep the level well below £100. Both EDF and the DECC insist the discussions are still moving forward and they remain optimistic that a deal can be done, but privately there are admissions on both sides of the argument that a breakdown of talks would not be disastrous for either. EDF has its own financial issues to worry about as it is struggling with €40bn (£34bn) of debt. The UK government, meanwhile, is aware that energy security – if not carbon emission targets – might be met more cheaply by gas-fired power stations which can be constructed quicker. The Hinkley Point reactors would cost an estimated £14bn to build. Any decision by EDF to bring in a Chinese partner would worry some politicians who have raised questions about the security implications of China gaining access to Britain's strategic energy assets. But a DECC spokesman pointed out that the chancellor, George Osborne, was keen for Beijing to invest in British infrastructure. The spokesman said: \"The UK welcomes global investment into the energy sector. Any company operating in this sector will need to meet all necessary safety and security standards.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/06/iran-nuclear-enrichment-elections-bargain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-06T05:59:01Z","webTitle":"Iran has a right to peaceful nuclear enrichment | Peter Oborne and David Morrison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/iran-nuclear-enrichment-elections-bargain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/iran-nuclear-enrichment-elections-bargain","fields":{"headline":"Iran has a right to peaceful nuclear enrichment","bodyText":"The campaign to elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's successor as Iranian president is well under way. The eight candidates took part in a TV debate on cultural policies yesterday, with a further debate scheduled before the vote takes place on 14 June. Internationally there is despair. Absent from the debate was the former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, excluded from the list of approved candidates by the Guardian Council. That move was taken as a sign that Iran is about to turn its back on nuclear negotiations. This is too gloomy. It is certainly true that Rafsanjani, who was president from 1989 to 1997, has ripened in old age into a member of the reform camp. However, it would be hard to put a cigarette paper between him and other presidential candidates on the nuclear issue. All of them fully support Iran's current nuclear programme and insist that it is entitled to carry out uranium enrichment on its own soil. All are fully agreed in rejecting western demands that Iran should abandon its peaceful programme. Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, is said to be making strong progress (though in the absence of polling evidence it is hard to be sure). He is sometimes viewed as a hardliner, but that may not be a bad thing. If he is trusted by the supreme leader, he may be given extra freedom to negotiate on the nuclear issue. The figure most likely to take up the reformist mantle of the absent Rafsanjani, however, has a record of flexibility in talking to the west. Hassan Rouhani headed Iran's nuclear negotiating team from 2003 to 2005. It was during his term of office that Iran made an extraordinary offer that could have solved the nuclear standoff between Iran and the west once and for all. At a meeting in the Quai d'Orsay (the French ministry of foreign affairs) on 23 March 2005, Iran unveiled the most comprehensive and important offer it has ever made. It proposed the continuous presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Authority at Iran's enrichment facilities, immediate conversion of all low-enriched uranium to fuel rods for power reactors (precluding the possibility of further enrichment) and no processing of spent fuel rods, ruling out the possibility of plutonium production. In return, Iran demanded that the west allow it to carry on with its programme of peaceful nuclear enrichment. This was a reasonable demand, since Iran has an \"inalienable right\" to develop peaceful nuclear power under article 4.1 of the non-proliferation treaty, which it signed in 1968. The offer, however, was rejected out of hand, and there is no doubt why. Acting on instructions from the US, the European negotiators were determined not to \"tolerate even the operation of even one centrifuge in Iran\". Though there are faults on both sides, this refusal to acknowledge Iran's right to peaceful enrichment remains the most fundamental stumbling block to any resolution of the nuclear argument. Whoever wins this month's elections, no progress is possible unless the west acknowledges this point. Happily there are signs that President Obama's new administration may be ready to be flexible. In 2009 Senator John Kerry (then chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee) told the Financial Times that under the treaty, Iran had \"a right to peaceful nuclear power and to enrichment in that purpose\". So there is every reason to feel hopeful that the Iranian elections can open the way to a full resolution of the Iranian nuclear problem. If so, any deal will look very similar to the one offered by Iranian presidential hopeful Hassan Rouhani in 2005 – and flatly rejected on the orders of George Bush."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-diary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T19:21:08Z","webTitle":"Conference diary: Charles Kennedy addresses fringe meeting on Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-diary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-diary","fields":{"headline":"Conference diary: Charles Kennedy addresses fringe meeting on Europe","bodyText":"• On BBC Scotland's sofa on Sunday Nick Clegg said constitutional reform was one of four Lib Dem major achievements since 2010. At least he did until Andrew Marr pointed out that it wasn't. But the one significant change the coalition agreement has managed to implement is transforming this year's party conference season. Normally at this stage in the cycle, MPs, activists and media would be obsessing about the date of a likely 2014 election. April? May? June? October? Thanks to the fixed-term parliament law we all now know it will be 7 May 2015. No fun in that. • Resolutely unfashionable, Vince Cable wanders the conference hotel corridors hand-in-hand with his wife, Rachel. Despite the burdens of high office, coalition battles (with Danny Alexander) and ham-fisted Clegg-baiting by Vince's bagman, Matthew Oakeshott, the 70-year-old business secretary looks tanned and relaxed ahead of today's big economic speech. \"He's like Dorian Gray, it's me who feels the strain,\" Rachel tells friends. In Oscar Wilde's novel Dorian's ravaged alter ego was kept in the attic, not taken to Glasgow. • Chris Huhne's brainy ex-wife, economist Vicky Pryce, used an article in last week's Beast on Sunday to attack Lib Dem plans to impose a Cable-style 2% mansion tax on £2m houses (£20,000 a year for cash-poor Kensington widows to find). Huhne is not yet in Glasgow, but not forgotten either. In yesterday's bikes debate one delegate raged against leniency to those \"who break the rules of the road\" – such as cycling without lights at night (even within the speed limit). We take her point. • The tenacious Gibraltar lobby, which always rents expensive stalls at party conferences to boost support for the Rock, held a reception for Lib Dems attended by Fabian Picardo, its fiery chief minister, and his Liberal deputy, Joseph Garcia. Their Lib-Lab coalition may be an inspiration for us in 2015, quips Andrew MacKinlay, ex-Labour MP and Gib booster who is helping out while attending his first party conference for years. Going to Labour's became a waste of time and money, says the old troublemaker. \"I wasn't one of the glitterati.\" • Former party leader Charles Kennedy addressed a fringe meeting on Europe, where he said sterling would not join the euro during his career – and blamed Tony Blair, who could, he said, have won a referendum in 1998 on the principle of joining. As distinct from the practice. Good day Cambridge MP Julian Huppert, who won the U-turn vote on nuclear power, then championed a less controversial motion on bike power. Bad day Ed Davey, the bruiser and energy secretary's puns about Tory colleagues (\"badgering Owen Paterson) bombed so badly that even the politically neutral Press Association reported it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jul/04/uk-energy-companies-arctic-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-04T12:52:00Z","webTitle":"Centrica, E.ON and RWE lead Arctic rush for oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/04/uk-energy-companies-arctic-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jul/04/uk-energy-companies-arctic-oil","fields":{"headline":"Centrica, E.ON and RWE lead Arctic rush for oil","bodyText":"Half of the big six energy companies operating in the UK are leading a new dash into the Arctic in search of new oil and gas after gaining exploration licences in Norwegian waters. The push comes despite three of Norway's environment agencies warning that total or partial drilling bans are needed in most of the blocks. The most controversial is the block in the Barents Sea awarded to E.ON, which the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (NIMR) said should not be opened at all, because of the risk to marine life including the largest cods stocks left in the world. RWE, known to UK energy customers as npower, and Centrica, which owns British Gas, were also awarded exploration licences. All the companies are the operating partners for the blocks, in consortia with other companies including, in Centrica's case, Russia's Lukoil. \"This is bad for the climate, the high north and environmental management regimes,\" said Frederic Hauge, leader of green NGO Bellona. Ben Ayliffe Greenpeace's Arctic campaigner said: \"Not content with sucking their customers dry, half of the big six energy suppliers have now turned their attention to the Arctic. Customers of these companies probably didn't realise that their rocketing bills would pay for fossil fuel exploration in a vulnerable region of breathtaking beauty, and shareholders may be concerned to learn they're on the hook for potentially astronomical clean-up bills when the inevitable spills occur. \"Because of its remote location and the extreme conditions, an oil spill in the Arctic would be virtually impossible to clean up. On top of that the cold water makes it's harder for the oil to degrade, meaning its stays in the environment longer. That's why a big oil spill in the Arctic would be catastrophic – for the humans who live there and the wildlife they share it with.\" E.ON's exploration and production's spokesman, Kjetil Hjertvik, said: \"We are, and will always be, fully compliant with the strict terms governing each license block's usage.\" E.ON is partnering with ConocoPhillips, Statoil and Petoro in developing the blocks. According to NIMR, other blocks, including Centrica's, should be subject to a breeding-season ban on \"drilling in oil-bearing formations between 1 March and 31st August and [allow] no emissions of chemicals, cuttings and produced water\". However, a recent statement by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said some drill cuttings and drill fluid could be released. Alan McLaughlin, at Centrica Energy, said: \"We've only just been awarded the block so we don't have an environmental plan to share. But before any exploration can take place, robust environment surveys are carried out to identify specific environmental sensitivities, to provide us with information on presence of vulnerable species. The exploration is then planned around these issues to reduce any risk to the environment.\" In June, Centrica spent £160m buying into Cuadrilla's shale gas fracking operations in the UK, having written off £200m in February in abandoning its joint venture with EDF Energy to build new nuclear power stations. In addition to the NIMR warnings, Norway's Climate and Pollution Agency said new activity in the region would challenge the ability to cope with emergencies or oil spills and harm the large flocks of seabirds there, while Norway's Directorate for Nature Management also advised against oil and gas activity in many of the new blocks. The Barents Sea blocks are all well within the Arctic circle but in an area mostly free of sea ice. However, the warmer waters mean many millions of fish and birds feed there. McLaughlin said: \"We will of course take into account what the authorities and other groups have said about specific environmental sensitivities when planning for any drilling activity and this will include taking into account spawning seasons and discharge levels. We have confidence that our exploration activity can be carried out safely.\" Both Shell and Cairn energy have suffered serious setbacks in their ongoing attempts to explore oil and gas prospects in the Arctic, with US interior secretary saying in March that Shell had \"screwed up\" its efforts to explore off Alaska, having failed to the extreme weather conditions. A spokesman for RWE Dea said the company operated in accordance with Norwegian law: \"The process of opening new areas is a comprehensive one, and many organisations, including the NIMR, provide input. The decision on whether or not to open new areas, however, lies with the Norwegian government, and RWE Dea respects its decision.\" E.ON, which cited technical delays in pulling out of a wave power project in Orkney on Wednesday, scrapped joint plans with RWE in 2012 to build new nuclear power stations in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/aug/09/science-greens","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-09T13:57:00Z","webTitle":"Science v Greens?

We're all greens now","bodyText":"I'm not sure whether it is wise to start a science blog with a reference to The Big Bang Theory, what with its depiction of scientists as socially illiterate uber-nerds, but here goes. The debate on \"Science vs the Greens\" that has played out over the past few days reminds me of the episode where Dr Sheldon Cooper tries to teach Penny \"a little physics\", starting with the question \"What is physics?\". To paraphrase Dr Cooper, if we are to debate science and the greens first we have to ask ourselves what is \"science\" and who or what are \"the greens\". You could write a book on what constitutes \"science\", but let's assume most people understand the term as referring to knowledge gained through observation, experimentation, and systematic rational study. However, the term \"greens\" is more problematic. The majority of contributors to this series have defined \"greens\" narrowly as a deep green constituency embodied by the views of Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Green Party as well-meaning but naive eco-warriors. This is understandable. There is a tendency to regard the green movement as the preserve of a hippy idealists – personally I blame Swampy. But if scientists occasionally resent the stereotype of comedic awkwardness embodied by The Big Bang crowd, then many greens similarly reject the suggestion their movement is ruled more by anti-science utopian ideology than scientifically credible pragmatism. The implication that there is serious tension between the scientific and green communities is flawed on at least two grounds. First, as Alice Bell and Anne Chapman have noted, the opposition of some green groups to nuclear power and GM crops is often based more on economic considerations than a misreading of the science. There have undoubtedly been some green campaigners guilty of using junk science to scaremonger on these issues, but the majority of criticism aimed at these technologies is now based on concerns about the high cost of nuclear power and the extent to which GM innovations pose unknown risks and hand immense power to the corporations that control the technology. Second, even if the traditional green community were \"anti-science\" (and it's not) limiting the discussion of the movement's relationship with science to the deep greens locks out the expanding ranks of New Environmentalists who are fully signed up to green principles even if they hold more flexible positions on touchstone issues such as nuclear and GM. The implication that the only greens are members of Greenpeace is like arguing you can only be a feminist if you write for Spare Rib. Traditional green groups are not the sole representatives of the \"greens\", nor would they want to be regarded as such. Some questions: Is the boss of Sainsbury's, Justin King, a green with his plan to invest £1bn in sustainability measures by 2020? What about IKEA top dog Mikael Ohlsson and his plan to ensure the company generates all its own energy by the end of the decade? Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, David Cameron, and Angela Merkel may be the subject of entirely deserved criticism from the green community, but they are all pursuing policies designed to build a greener economy – do they qualify? Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Larry Page may not have much in common with the director of Greenpeace, but they have mobilised billions of dollars in clean tech investment. Are they part of the green community? More broadly, a recent Ipsos MORI poll of over 2,400 people found 74% of people are very or fairly concerned about climate change, 85% want to see more solar power, 75% are in favour of wind power, and 81% want to curb their energy use – could they be classified as green? Perhaps not, but they share many of the goals and aspirations of traditional greens. With the exception of those protecting the pollutocrat status quo, large numbers of people and businesses are, to varying degrees, New Environmentalists. We may not regard the environment as a top priority given the state of the economy, but we are concerned about environmental impacts and are keen to see environmental challenges addressed. In this regard at least, we're all greens now. Sadly, the greens may have won several important battles in securing support for a greener economy, but they are a long way from winning the war – emissions are still rising. It is this ongoing challenge that means there is little conflict between New Environmentalists and the scientific community. The growing consensus across the green community, including significant numbers of deep greens, is that a technology-led response to climate change is the last best hope of avoiding potentially catastrophic impacts during the second half of this century. For that we must work with scientists to urgently develop sources of clean energy, sustainable food and water supplies, and climate adaptation measures. As David King and Richard Layard argued last week in the FT we need a new Apollo Project focused on clean energy, and we need it now. Perhaps the next series of the Big Bang Theory will see Dr Cooper and co turn their attention to the global need for low cost solar power – many of their real-life counterparts are already doing so. And as they continue with this vital work, the growing ranks of New Environmentalists wish them well. James Murray is editor of BusinessGreen. You can follow him on Twitter @james_BG.

The company confirmed it will close its office in Stoke on Trent and one of three offices in Oldbury in the West Midlands as back-office customer service functions are moved to India over the next eight months. There will also be redundancies at its Rainton Bridge base in Sunderland, and in Leeds, while a further 540 jobs will be transferred to British firm Capita. The npower chief executive, Paul Massara, said that while the changes would be \"incredibly hard for some of our employees\", they were necessary \"to deliver the levels of service our customers deserve\". He added: \"We would have the flexibility to keep call waiting times down during busy periods, and continue to keep costs down so we can keep bills down. All calls would still be answered in the UK.\" The announcement is expected to intensify public anger around the activities of the Big Six power companies and raise the political heat in Westminster where energy has risen to the top of the agenda. Trade unions accused npower of serving up a \"Christmas nightmare\" by announcing plans to move back-office jobs to India using Tata Consultancy Services and transfer hundreds of frontline call centre jobs to Capita. Union leaders warned the moves would backfire and further tarnish the reputation of npower, which came bottom for customer service in a recent survey and which told a parliamentary committee earlier this year it had paid almost no corporation tax for three years. Npower, the energy supplier of Germany's RWE, raised gas and electricity customers 10.4% earlier this month. Its central London offices were the target of fuel poverty demonstrations this week. The company, which employs 11,000 people in the UK, informed staff of the changes on Thursday morning, after details had already appeared in the press. Npower staff at other locations will also be affected by the plans, which include the closure of its Thornaby office in the north-east, where staff will keep their jobs if they relocate to the Rainton office about 30 miles away. Several teams currently based in Peterlee will also have to move to Rainton if they want to keep their jobs. Npower and the other big six firms such as SSE and Centrica insist they are having to raise domestic bills and trim their costs to counterrising wholesale prices and green levies for home insulation. Npower's parent RWE said earlier this month that 6,750 jobs would need to be cut across Europe as it tries to reduce a £28bn debt mountain, partly caused by Berlin's decision to phase out nuclear power stations. In Britain, RWE shelved plans for a £4bn wind farm in the Bristol Channel this week, a week after it sold off part of its gas and electricity supply business. It has also put up for sale its DEA business which operates oil and gasfields in the North Sea and also shelved plans to construct new nuclear plants in Britain. But Matthew Lay, national officer with the Unison union, said npower had consistently let its customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or in the latest customer service techniques. \"This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including to India. \"If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for customer service. \"At a time when unemployment is high, what commitment does it show to the UK by shipping these much-needed jobs abroad?

German 'Veggie Day' plan leaves Greens trailing","bodyText":"A dramatic fall in the polls for the Green party has been blamed in no small part on their Veggie Day proposal, in which canteens would be obliged to offer only vegetarian food once a week, with Germans (among the most enthusiastic carnivores in Europe) encouraged to follow suit at home. In an election campaign that has thus far often been described as dull and detached, critics seized on Veggie Day, making it one of the most talked-about proposals from any party. It has so far received almost as much airtime in pre-election debates as Syria and the eurozone crisis combined. Opponents in the liberal Free Democratic party have been firing up the barbecues in protest. The Greens have fallen in the polls by between four and five percentage points since August – and a staggering 10 points since 2011. They are now predicted to get just 9%-10% on 22 September. The numbers make Green prospects of becoming the third strongest party in the next Bundestag ever less likely, causing hopes to fade on the left of a Green-Social Democrat coalition. The Greens' mistake? Manfred Güllner, one of Germany's foremost pollsters, put it down primarily to their decision to shift the focus away from their core issues – the environment, women and peace – and turn instead to social justice. \"That was a strategic mistake, because it doesn't belong to their founding ideas,\" he said. \"It's a topic that remains the preserve of the SPD.\" And Veggie Day? \"Just another mistake among several,\" he told the foreign press, citing also Green calls for a minimum wage, which have done little to set it apart from the SPD or the Linke (Left) parties, as well as its calls to raise the top rate of tax to 49% for those earning more than €80,000 (£67,000). The Greens have not been helped by the fact that the wind has rather been taken out of their sails, as it were, by Merkel's decision, after the Fukushima disaster, to phase out nuclear power and thus remove a key concern on which Greens once built up a strong following. It has also fought an image problem over its tolerance of paedophilia, a 1980s shadow hanging over the party which it is still trying to tackle. Within the party itself criticism is rife that the once-towering force of the ecological movement in Europe has failed to connect with voters. Ruth Kastner, head of the Greens in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, has accused the party's leading candidates, Jürgen Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt, of poor communication, bemoaning the fact that Veggie Day, more than any other Green policy, has left the party open to accusations of pushing for an \"ecological dictatorship\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/15/china-nuclear-plants-pass-inspections","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-15T11:03:40Z","webTitle":"China's nuclear power plants pass safety inspections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/15/china-nuclear-plants-pass-inspections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/15/china-nuclear-plants-pass-inspections","fields":{"headline":"China's nuclear power plants pass safety inspections","bodyText":"China has moved a step closer towards resuming its ambitious nuclear power plans after it was revealed that safety inspectors have given the country's 13 reactors the all-clear. The clean bill of health makes it more likely that Beijing will not follow the example of other countries – most recently German, Italy and Japan – who have promised to scale back or abandon nuclear power in the wake of the meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant in March. China has the world's biggest nuclear expansion plans with a goal of more than 100 reactors by 2020, but it suspended permits for new plants after the tsunami disaster in Japan. The government said it would not be resumed until existing plants were checked, construction plans reviewed and a new national safety framework put in place. That process is now well under way, according to a statement by the deputy environment minister, Li Ganjie, posted on a government website. As well as the completed checks for plants in operation, reviews of facilities under construction would be finished by October, he said. Few analysts expect China to trim or delay targets that were included in the latest five-year economic plan to meet the power demands of a growing economy, while reducing the country's reliance on greenhouse gas-emitting fuel sources. But critical voices have grown louder. Professor He Zuoxiu, who helped to develop China's first atomic bomb, caused a storm last month when he claimed that plans to ramp up production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be as disastrous as the Great Leap Forward. Writing in the Science Times, he criticised government advisers for failing to disclose the earthquake risks posed to nuclear power plants and said they had overestimated the availability of uranium in the country and the maturity of fission technology. \"Are we really ready for this kind of giddy speed [of nuclear power development]? I think not – we're seriously underprepared, especially on the safety front,\" wrote the fellow of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nuclear power executives are counting on China to make up for demand that is being lost elsewhere amid the radiation fears prompted by Fukushima. Japan, Germany and Switzerland have all move to scale back nuclear power as a result of that disaster. China merely put its programme on hold to assess safety concerns. In the latest setback for the industry, the Italian electorate voted overwhelmingly against proposals to revive the country's nuclear energy programme. China, however, is still on course to have a nuclear capacity of 200 gigawatts by 2030 and 400GW by 2050 - more than 15% of the national energy supply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/nov/27/npower-cuts-1400-jobs-outsourcing-india","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-27T19:54:24Z","webTitle":"Npower to cut 1,400 UK jobs in outsourcing to India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/27/npower-cuts-1400-jobs-outsourcing-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/nov/27/npower-cuts-1400-jobs-outsourcing-india","fields":{"headline":"Npower to cut 1,400 UK jobs in outsourcing to India","bodyText":"Npower is to close offices and outsource work to India in a move that will see 1,400 UK staff lose their jobs at the energy supplier. The announcement is expected to intensify public anger around the activities of the Big Six power companies and raise the political heat in Westminster where energy has risen to the top of the political agenda. Trade unions accused npower of serving up a \"Christmas nightmare\" by planning to offshore 1,400 jobs to India and transfer a further 570 to another British firm, probably Capita. It is understood that frontline call-centre operations will be outsourced to a third party in the UK, with back-office work moved to India. Union leaders warned the moves would backfire and further tarnish the reputation of npower which came bottom for customer service in a recent survey and which told a parliamentary committee earlier this year that it had paid almost no corporation tax for three years. Npower, the energy supplier of Germany's RWE, hit gas and electricity customers with a 10.4% rise in fuel bills earlier this month and its central London offices were the target of fuel poverty demonstrations earlier this week. The company declined to comment on the planned office and staff cuts but well-informed sources told the Guardian that npower staff would be informed of the changes at 9am on Thursday. Npower said in a statement: \"As we announced a couple of months ago, npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK. \"We've been doing this to improve our customer service and keep our costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers' bills. As we've always said, we'll tell our people first and then inform the media,\" it added. Npower and the other big six firms such as SSE and Centrica insist that they are having to raise domestic bills and trim their costs in a bid to counter the impact of rising wholesale prices and green levies for home insulation. Npower's parent RWE said earlier this month that 6,750 jobs would need to be cut across Europe as it tries to reduce a debt mountain of over £28bn, partly caused by the Berlin government's decision to phase out nuclear power stations. In Britain RWE shelved plans for a £4bn wind farm in the Bristol Channel this week, a week after it sold off part of its gas and electricity supply business. It has also put up for sale its DEA business which operates oil and gas fields in the UK North Sea and also shelved plans to construct new nuclear plants in Britain. But Matthew Lay, National officer with the Unison union said npower had consistently let its customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or in the latest customer service techniques. \"This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including to India. \"If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for customer service. \"At a time when unemployment is high, what commitment does it show to the UK by shipping these much-needed jobs abroad? And what does this say about their commitment to staff when npower have kept them on tenterhooks, waiting for the axe to fall, for weeks?\" Colin Smith, the GMB union's northern region senior organiser, said his union would vigorously campaign against the offshoring of jobs to India because it had absolutely \"nothing to do with customer service and everything to do with cost\". The GMB added that it understood that site closures will be at Peterlee in Durham, Thornaby in North Yorkshire, and Stoke-on-Trent. \"This is about the cost of living, bad management and naked greed.

With less than a week to go before IOC officials vote for either Tokyo, Madrid or Istanbul, Japanese officials are confident of winning the race to 2020, notwithstanding renewed concern over radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The bookmakers have made Tokyo the favourite, with Istanbul a distant second. \"Our strength lies in our dependability in hosting the Games,\" said Tsunekazu Takeda, president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, as the city entered the final, decisive stages of its campaign. The bid committee is keen to emphasise that it has learned from London's successful bid for the 2012 Games. The Japanese capital has hired the same UK-based agency as London and Rio – host of the 2016 Games – to write its speeches and promotional material, and frequently cites the importance of the \"Olympic legacy\". If Tokyo's bid is successful, the Games will centre on the national Olympic stadium, the main venue for Japan's 1964 Olympics. The site will undergo a $1bn (£650m) refurbishment by the UK-based architect Zaha Hadid. By the time the Rugby World Cup comes to Japan in 2019, the ageing stadium will be a state-of-the art, 80,000-seat arena, complete with a retractable roof. The judo competition will be held at the Nippon Budokan, perhaps best known around the world as the venue for a series of concerts by the Beatles in 1966; the archery and equestrian events will take place on Yumenoshima (which translates as \"dream island\"), an artificial island built using waste landfill in the 1950s to deal with Tokyo's rubbish problem. Some of the football matches will be played in Miyagi, one of the three prefectures in the country's north-east, whose coastlines were devastated by the March 2011 tsunami. Public support for the bid is rising at home. Tokyo organisers last week cited a poll showing approval standing at 92%. The city's doomed bid for the 2016 Games fizzled out amid public indifference and accusations of wasteful spending, soon after the global economy was rocked by the Lehman Brothers bank collapse. Tokyo's cause wasn't helped by Shintaro Ishihara, its ultra-conservative governor at the time, who was viewed by many outside the capital as a divisive figure because of his confrontational stance towards China. His successor as governor, Naoki Inose, is less controversial, but was forced to apologise this year when he broke the IOC's rules on criticising rival bids with a culturally insensitive outburst directed at Turkey. \"Islamic countries … the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other,\" he said in a newspaper interview during a visit to New York. Inose compounded the gaffe by suggesting that London had secured the 2012 Games because it was \"in a developed country whose sense of hospitality is excellent. Tokyo's is also excellent. But other cities, not so much.\" The IOC decided not to take action after Inose issued an apology. Not everyone is an Olympics enthusiast. Tetsuo Ogawa of People Against the Olympics, a pressure group that opposes Tokyo's bid, is most concerned about the financial cost of the Olympics at a time when poverty levels are rising in Japan. \"Tokyo plans to spend a lot of money building accommodation for athletes, while it's preparing to evict homeless people from areas close to Olympic venues, including the main stadium,\" he said. \"The city spent a lot of tax money on its failed bid for 2016, and it is wasting it again on what is essentially a gamble.\" But the general mood is gung ho. In an obvious reference to the London 2012 Games, Takeda has repeatedly pointed to Tokyo's advanced sports and transport infrastructure, and its relative safety. While Japan has so far failed to rein in its huge public debt, its economic woes are mild compared with those of Spain. The clear message is that an Olympics in Tokyo would be trouble-free, and affordable. \"We believe that Tokyo 2020 will deliver superb, safe Games, which will be a safe pair of hands and be a great legacy for the Olympic movement,\" Japan's Olympic committee president said. Aside from drawing on the country's technological prowess, advanced infrastructure and stable source of funding, Tokyo is promising a \"downtown\" Games with 85% of the venues located within a five-mile radius of the Olympic village. \"The city enjoys the largest GDP of any city in the world,\" Takeda said. \"It already has a Games fund of $4.5bn in the bank, as well as full government financial guarantees [if there is a shortfall].\" With Japan showing early signs of climbing out of its deflationary spiral, Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister, has predicted a 3tn yen windfall from the Olympics, while the country's beleaguered corporations are expected to benefit from a slew of lucrative contracts in the construction, real estate, retail and service sectors. Tokyo's city leaders have also attempted to allay safety fears following the news last week that highly radioactive water had leaked from a storage tank at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan's nuclear watchdog raised the severity of the incident from one to three on an international scale for nuclear accidents. In response, Inose pointed out that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo are comparable with those in London and New York. \"The food and water in Tokyo are completely safe,\" he said. \"The situation in Fukushima will have no bearing on the vote [in Buenos Aires].\" In 1964, Japan had just embarked on a dramatic transformation that would see a defeated, traumatised nation become the world's second-biggest economy. The Games that summer were a clear signal that Japan had been welcomed into the international community, less than 20 years after the end of the Pacific war. Five decades later, buoyed by the example of London 2012, the hope is that the feelgood factor can return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2013/nov/05/guardian-weekly-letters-8-november","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-05T14:01:31Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 8 November 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/nov/05/guardian-weekly-letters-8-november","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2013/nov/05/guardian-weekly-letters-8-november","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 8 November 2013","bodyText":"Economics is a mystery One of the least well understood pieces of social behaviour is that governed by financial dealings between people and between nations. That measure of social behaviour in trading is called economics. The Nobel prize is regularly awarded for advancements in understanding economics and many of those awards go to the University of Chicago, which apparently has a great lobbying organisation, not for economic understanding so much as for Nobel prizes: 28 Nobels have been awarded in economics to the university in 41 years. In 2013, the Nobel prize was awarded to three individuals, two of whom are, of course, from the University of Chicago. Despite all this apparent advancement no one is any nearer to understanding how economic pressures work. These gentlemen \"laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices\" (14 October). A longer official tribute said: \"There is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings, which might seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analysed by this year's Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.\" If that were true we would expect these three individuals to make a mint in the next three to five years. Unfortunately for them, that is not going to happen. Why? Because no one has the least idea of how economic principles work with any sort of surety. Furthermore, these gentlemen know that. The Nobel prize in economics is a farce. John Graham Hoogstraten, Belgium Malala deserved the prize Malala Yousafzai as an education activist, campaigning for rights to education for women, and to ensure free compulsory education for every child, seems not to be good enough for the Nobel peace prize ('I believe in peace. I believe in mercy', 18 October). However, the prize went to President Barack Obama when he was in the midst of escalating the US war effort in Afghanistan, and who has now perfected targeted assassinations with his lethal drone policy. It would be interesting to find out the criteria followed by the selection committee for awarding the prize to \"champions of peace\", as Alfred Nobel wanted. Lucila Makin Cambridge, UK Munro has gone global Margaret Atwood claims that Alice Munro's Nobel \"will draw international attention\" (18 October). The truth is that Munro's stories are already read and admired around the world. When I was in Buenos Aires in December 2011, a bookstore on Calle Florida was selling Las Lunas de Jupiter (Moons of Jupiter) and Amistad de Juventud (Friend of My Youth). Six of her books are translated into Farsi, and thus available at bookstores in Tehran. Runaway is translated into Chinese, and in Paris and Montreal, readers can buy, among others, Trop de Bonheur (Too Much Happiness). Munro even transcends the high linguistic and cultural walls of Canada. Soon after her Nobel prize was announced, the respected Canadian novelist Yves Beauchemin expressed his admiration. \"What is striking about her style,\" he told La Presse Canadienne, \"is the voice, at once tough and penetrating, yet always human and warm.\" Munro makes all Canadians proud. R B Fleming Argyle, Ontario, Canada We have bigger problems Yes, they built a tunnel under the Thames: so what. They sent a man to the moon: so what. They decoded the human genome: so what! And now an awful lot of money is going to build a model of the human brain (25 October), yet we already have 7bn human brains attached to real human beings, so why do we need another one? The human brain is so sophisticated that we will probably never understand its basic functionality, let alone its incredible adaptability. I'm sorry about Henry Markram's son, but I don't think building a human brain will solve his autism. Could we please be a little more thoughtful about throwing €1bn at a project that is unlikely to solve any of the world's pressing problems. Bruce George Candelo, NSW, Australia We need the answers So Gary Younge tells us that the Republican right was howling for the moon (25 October), Larry Elliott writes that the greening of the economy needs a commitment similar to that which put a man on the moon in the 1960s, and Timothy Garton Ash expects a friendly billionaire to subsidise a TV channel to tell Americans what they don't want to know about their own country. What better illustration could there be of the awful paucity of doable ideas and policies that would actually get us out of the mess we are in. It is now well-established that the American government is effectively dysfunctional. I wouldn't bet that business and governments will adopt long-term policies to promote sustainability. And telling the Americans what the rest of the world thinks of them will only push them deeper into their laager. Of course, all three commentators were right. But it left me even more pessimistic about securing a better life for future generations. We know the problems. When will somebody come up with realistic suggestions to change our trajectories? Or is this also calling for the moon? John Burley Divonne les Bains, France Pilger is too simplistic John Pilger's article China's role in Africa is Obama's obsession (18 October) makes a simplistic and unwarranted assumption. \"The shopping mall atrocity was a response to this [President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's effusive thanks to America for unwavering support] – just as the Twin Towers attack and the London bombings were explicit reactions to invasion and injustice\". The motives for all three events were never so clear-cut: the perpetrators and the planners often had widely differing motivations and the messages broadcast by them show this clearly. Such writing is unbecoming of a journal known worldwide for its measured and unbiased treatment of global events. Brian Turner Adeje, Spain Crazy party's aftermath Regarding your story, IPCC report: Human impact is unequivocal (27 September): I work in the New Zealand forest and am lucky enough to have little to do with mainstream society other than the Guardian Weekly, but two facets of the climate change debate never fail to dismay. First, the fact that people are even debating whether to use up all the available oil and coal resources. Surely that's like someone arriving early at a party and debating if he or she should drink all the beer before everyone else arrives. Are we to be the generations that descendants refer to as the greedy bastards who didn't leave any oil for them? Second, all this talk of \"carbon budgets\" and sustainable energy circumvents any reference to \"people budgets\". If we reduced our population while we still have fossil fuels as a prop, carbon budgets would be a natural by-product of the process. Why should the right to bear children be any less questionable than the right to bear arms? From the outside looking in, global civilisation seems to me like a sex-crazed, binge-drinking party that some other poor bastards are going to have to clean up. Chris Brausch Katikati, New Zealand We must protect small farms Failure to nurture smallholder agricultural production – especially in developing countries – will have a negative impact on sustainable food production in the future (Colombians risk death in land fight; Coffee rust creates crisis in Guatemala's fields, 25 October). Smallholders still produce 80% of food in developing countries and their contribution will be even more crucial as the population drift from rural to urban centres continues unchecked. Smallholder producers deserve to be protected from unscrupulous land grabbers whose aim is profit maximisation, which usually means producing industrial crops for export, rather than food for local consumption. The inspiring example of the Guatemalan smallholders who are focussing on environmentally friendly food production is one to be supported. Protecting the environment while achieving food sovereignty is the key principle driving the UN's global efforts to mainstream sustainable crop production intensification, which has the potential to feed the world and conserve our natural capital for future generations.

The prime minister has said he does not intend to vote and his government tried to scotch the ballot in a failed court appeal. A turnout of more than 50% would be a second humiliating blow to the prime minister following defeat in last month's local elections in his home city of Milan. After the courts threw out the government's appeal against the nuclear referendum, opposition groups mounted an energetic campaign to increase turnout. Pierluigi Bersani, the leader of Italy's biggest opposition group the centre-left Democratic party, said they were \"a step away\" from reaching their goal. Italy has not operated a nuclear plant since 1990. Three years earlier, a similar referendum was held in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Voters opted for the non-nuclear option in each of three ballots and Italy began phasing out its nuclear capacity, including an almost completed plant at Montalto di Castro, north of Rome. But referendum decisions in Italy last only five years. Since 1992, Italian governments have, in theory, been free to embark on a new nuclear energy programme. Italy is the only member of the G8 that does not produce nuclear power and supporters of nuclear energy argue that it is the key reason for the country's exceptionally high electricity bills. The high cost of electricity to both private consumers and business is also cited as a prime cause of Italy's low economic growth in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/21/iran-geneva-nuclear-talks-enrich-uranium-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-21T13:04:45Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear negotiator digs heels in over right to enrich uranium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/iran-geneva-nuclear-talks-enrich-uranium-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/21/iran-geneva-nuclear-talks-enrich-uranium-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear negotiator digs heels in over right to enrich uranium","bodyText":"Iran entrenched its position at nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday, insisting it would not sign an agreement that did not have specific guarantees of its right to enrich uranium. The talks adjourned for the night, with no sight of a breakthough. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said: \"We are working on narrowing the gaps, but the gaps are still there.\" Western officials said that Iran's right to enrich was one of the most serious of those gaps. The issue is one of the thorniest at the negotiations and one of the main reasons the last round of talks here broke up without agreement on 10 November despite intense bargaining by ministers including the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. This week Zarif appeared to offer a concession, suggesting Tehran might no longer insist on hammering out wording in the interim agreement that explicitly guaranteed Iran the right to enrich uranium, saying there could be references to the right already, under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But an Iranian negotiator at the talks denied the Iranian position had eased. \"If this element is not in the text, it is unacceptable to us. Without that, there will be no agreement.\" The 1968 NPT is vague on the subject. It guarantees a nation's right to a peaceful nuclear programme, without mentioning enrichment specifically. But signatories are obliged not to develop weapons and to agree on inspection regimes with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A compromise had been floated in the days running up the latest Geneva talks whereby the agreement text would mention NPT rights and the parties would interpret that in their own way. However, the Iranian negotiator said that would not be enough for Tehran. \"It is because there are different interpretations of the NPT that there is a need to spell it out in the text. We are trying to find language that is the least problematic for all parties, but what is essential is the element of enrichment.\" Western states acknowledge that they will have to accept some degree of Iranian enrichment as a fait accompli in any interim agreement. This is the focus of the Geneva agreement being negotiated, a deal that aims to slow down, stop or reverse elements of the nuclear programme in exchange for limited sanctions relief. However, Washington and its allies, particularly France, do not want to put that acceptance in writing, lest it serve as a legal precedent for global proliferation. Enrichment of uranium is a dual-use technology which can produce weapons-grade fissile material for warheads as well as fuel for nuclear power stations. The Iranian official at the talks said he had not read Zarif's earlier, apparently conciliatory, remarks on enrichment. Western officials at the talks said the Iranian delegation had stressed how much pressure they had been under at home from hardliners. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, declared on the eve of the new round of talks in Geneva that the negotiators had been set strict red lines on what they could accept. Zarif met the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, on Thursday morning for detailed talks on the current draft agreement, which has disputed paragraphs in brackets, and negotiators said the general atmosphere was positive. Contingency preparations have been made for Kerry and foreign ministers from the other five nations at the talks – the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – to fly to Switzerland at short notice if a deal is near. Araqchi said that if the remaining gaps in the negotiations narrowed, the foreign ministers would probably fly in. However, France signalled on Wednesday that it would stick to its tough line on Iran and that it was not ready to make more concessions. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said he hoped a deal could be clinched but added: \"This agreement can only be possible based on firmness. For now, the Iranians have not been able to accept the position of the six. I hope they will accept it.\" The Iranian official said that in contrast to the last round of talks, when Fabius openly voiced objections to a draft text, the six-nation group had stayed united on this occasion and let Ashton talk on their behalf. \"The French are no longer in the forefront of negotiations,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jan/02/uk-eu-renewables-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-02T11:04:07Z","webTitle":"UK opposition to new EU green energy targets could risk 'half a million jobs'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/02/uk-eu-renewables-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/02/uk-eu-renewables-targets","fields":{"headline":"UK opposition to new EU green energy targets could risk 'half a million jobs'","bodyText":"Over half a million new jobs over the next two decades could be at risk from the UK's opposition to new EU targets for green energy, according to a leaked official report from the European commission. Since last spring, European countries have been battling over what new climate change targets should be set to follow the existing ones for greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency, which run out in 2020. The UK, along with the Czech Republic, is strongly opposed to setting a new renewable energy goal for 2030, favouring an overall target for greenhouse gas emissions instead – which would entail an ambitious cut of 50% on 1990 levels. They want countries to be allowed the freedom to reach the target as they choose to, for example by relying heavily on nuclear power. Energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, has said: \"We need a technology neutral approach to how individual countries meet their emissions targets ... we will therefore oppose a renewable energy target at an EU level as inflexible and unnecessary.\" But a draft report, commissioned by the European commission on the impact of setting different targets and seen by the Guardian, says that including renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in addition to a greenhouse gas emissions target would create around 568,000 more jobs across Europe by 2030 than an emissions one alone. However, the cost of having renewable energy and efficiency targets would be 2.6% higher than with just an emissions target alone, the report notes. Germany, Denmark, Austria and Finland back a renewable energy target. A new energy efficiency target is considered unlikely. The wind industry said that not setting a renewable energy target would make it harder for developers to attract investment. Maf Smith, RenewableUK's deputy chief executive, said: \"The EU needs to show leadership here and set a 2030 renewable energy target as a matter of priority. It would send a crucial political signal on the continuing direction of travel away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources across Europe. If the EU were to fail to step up to the mark on this, it would be more difficult for renewable energy developers to attract much needed investment in their projects, as it would push up the cost of raising capital.\" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The UK's view is that a single, greenhouse gas target is the most effective way of combatting climate change, keeping energy prices down and strengthening energy security. A binding renewables target would not allow individual countries the flexibility to meet their emissions target.\" Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat MEP who sits on the EU committee on the environment, public health and food safety, warned against the cost of an \"almost religious commitment to renewables.\" \"Overall, having a renewable energy target is an expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions, and rules out other long-term options such as carbon capture and storage. If Europe wants to reduce emissions at the least significant cost, it needs to be left to countries to decide how to do it,\" Davies told the Guardian. \"You have to have to consider energy costs. What is the subsidy per job cost?\" He also said the UK's ambitious 50% carbon target was unlikely to be politically palatable in Europe. \"With people concerned about the reduction in energy prices in US compared to relatively high cost of energy in Europe, getting above 40% is going to be enormously difficult, people just won't sign up for it.\" Labour also said it was opposed to a fresh renewable energy target. Tom Greatrex, shadow energy minister, said: \"Tackling the complex challenge of climate change requires policies and targets which are sufficiently flexible to accommodate ever-evolving solutions. We remain unconvinced that a 2030 renewables target provides this necessary optionality, since it overlooks a number of low-carbon but non-renewable technologies, such as carbon capture and storage.\" Companies have stepped up their lobbying ahead of the European commission laying out its thinking on the targets towards the end of January, when the assessment on the economic, environmental and social impacts is expected to be published. Gamesa, Dong, Vestas are among eight energy companies who called earlier last month for a target of more than 30% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2030, saying: \"It will bring down our energy and electricity bills, and help remove the need for renewable energy support in future.\" Pitted against them is the European power industry association, whose president and the CEO of energy company E.ON, Johannes Teyssen, has come out backing an emissions target but says Europe does not need a new renewable energy or energy efficiency target. The new German government has already set a target of 40-45% of its electricity supply coming from renewable sources by 2025, higher than the 30-35% EU-wide target being discussed. By contrast, the UK has been one of the worst performers for share of energy generated by renewable sources, near the bottom of the European league table along with Malta and Luxembourg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/10/fukushima-operator-dump-contaminated-water-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-10T16:56:22Z","webTitle":"Fukushima operator may have to dump contaminated water into Pacific","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/10/fukushima-operator-dump-contaminated-water-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/10/fukushima-operator-dump-contaminated-water-pacific","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima operator may have to dump contaminated water into Pacific","bodyText":"A senior adviser to the operator of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has told the firm that it may have no choice but to eventually dump hundreds of thousands of tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean. Speaking to reporters who were on a rare visit to the plant on the eve of the third anniversary of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, Dale Klein said Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] had yet to reassure the public over the handling of water leaks that continue to frustrate efforts to clean up the site. \"The one issue that keeps me awake at night is Tepco's long-term strategy for water management,\" said Klein, a former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission who now leads Tepco's nuclear reform committee. \"Storing massive amounts of water on-site is not sustainable. A controlled release is much safer than keeping the water on-site. \"Tepco is making progress on water management but I'm not satisfied yet. It's frustrating that the company takes four or five steps forward, then two back. And every time you have a leakage it contributes to a lack of trust. There's room for improvement on all fronts.\" Tepco's failure to manage the buildup of contaminated water came to light last summer, when it admitted that at least 300 tonnes of tainted water were leaking into the sea every day. That revelation was followed by a string of incidents involving spills from poorly assembled storage tanks, prompting the government to commit about $500m (£300m) into measures to contain the water. They include the construction of an underground frozen wall to prevent groundwater mixing with contaminated coolant water, which becomes tainted after coming into contact with melted nuclear fuel deep inside the damaged reactors. Tepco confirmed that it would activate an experimental wall at a test site at the plant on Tuesday. If the test is successful, the firm plans to build a similar structure almost 2km in length around four damaged reactors next year, although some experts have questioned its ability to use the technology on such a large scale. Klein, too, voiced scepticism over the frozen wall solution, and suggested that the controlled release of treated water into the Pacific was preferable to storing huge quantities of it on site. But Tepco, the government and nuclear regulators would have to win the support of local fishermen, and the release of even treated water would almost certainly draw a furious response from China and South Korea. \"It's a very emotional issue,\" Klein said. \"But Tepco and the government will have to articulate their position to other people. For me, the water issue is more about policy than science.\" Tepco is pinning its hopes on technology that can remove dozens of dangerous radionuclides, apart from tritium, internal exposure to which has been linked to a greater risk of developing cancer. Klein, however, said tritium does not pose the same threat to heath as bone-settling strontium and caesium, and can be diluted to safe levels before it is released into the sea. The Fukushima Daiichi plant's manager, Akira Ono, said the firm had no plans to release contaminated water into the Pacific, but agreed that decommissioning would remain on hold until the problem was solved. \"The most pressing issue for us is the contaminated water, rather than decommissioning,\" he said. \"Unless we address this issue the public will not be assured and the evacuees will not be able to return home. \"We are in a positive frame of mind over decommissioning the plant over the next 30 to 40 years, But we have to take utmost care every step of the way because errors can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\" Currently about 400 tonnes of groundwater is streaming into the reactor basements from the hills behind the plant each day. The plant has accumulated about 300,000 tonnes of contaminated water, which is being stored in 1,200 tanks occupying a large swath of the Fukushima Daiichi site. Eventually Tepco hopes to have enough space to store 800,000 tonnes, but fears are rising that it will run out of space sometime next year because it can't keep up with the flow of toxic water. Fukushima three years on For visitors and workers alike, the journey to the plant begins at J-Village, a former training complex for the Japanese football team that now serves as the Fukushima cleanup's logistical base. During the 20-minute bus ride through neighbourhoods still bearing the scars of the earthquake and tsunami, there were signs that decontamination work is making modest progress. Atmospheric radiation levels are falling, leading the authorities to partially lift evacuation orders in neighbourhoods on the edge of the evacuation zone. Some of Fukushima's 100,000-plus nuclear evacuees are now permitted to return to their homes during the day, but radiation levels are still too high for them to make a permanent return. In the town of Naraha, where atmospheric radiation hovered around 2 microsieverts an hour on Monday – the official decontamination target is 0.23 microsieverts an hour – large black bags filled with radioactive soil cover fields once used for agriculture, where they will remain until agreement can be reached on a permanent disposal site. Part of a railway line running along to coast is due to reopen in the spring, although stretches of track that pass through the most contaminated areas are expected to remain closed for years. Inside Fukushima Daiichi, reporters were reminded of the frantic attempts by a small group of Tepco engineers to save the plant from an even greater catastrophe in the hours after its power supply was knocked out by a towering tsunami three years ago. In the control room for reactors 1 and 2, both of which suffered meltdowns, one worker's attempts to record water levels by scribbling them on to a disabled control panel are still visible. None of the unnamed men, who had to work by torchlight, are still at the site: some have retired, but most had to leave because they quickly reached their lifetime radiation dose limit. \"It is difficult to describe what that time was like for those workers,\" said Kenichiro Matsui, a Tepco official. \"They worked tirelessly to save the reactors. They had a real sense of mission.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jan/31/article-50-debate-brexit-government-lying-about-how-easy-brexit-will-be-says-owen-smith-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-01T00:18:03Z","webTitle":"Brexit: MPs debate article 50 bill - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/31/article-50-debate-brexit-government-lying-about-how-easy-brexit-will-be-says-owen-smith-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/31/article-50-debate-brexit-government-lying-about-how-easy-brexit-will-be-says-owen-smith-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: MPs debate article 50 bill - as it happened","bodyText":"The debate has now ended for the night after nearly 12 hours of talking. It will continue tomorrow. Here’s a summary of tonight’s speeches: David Lammy, who will be voting against the bill, made one of the evening’s most powerful speeches and quoted both Enoch Powell and Winston Churchill. He said: “[Tories] salivate at the thought of becoming a tax haven like Singapore. But the poorest will be the ones to suffer and many of them are in my constituency.” Caroline Lucas, also made a passionate speech, saying she spoke for all those who continue to be “desperately concerned”. She criticises the way May has moved towards what she calls an extreme Brexit and the way she had dealt with Trump. Another who plans to vote against the bill was Heidi Alexander, who said she had planned to do the opposite until Theresa May’s speech in Lancaster House, which made her feel “ashamed”. Nick Chalk, was one of several Tory MPs who campaigned to remain but will vote for the bill saying that’s what true democrats will do. Ed Vaizey, who was a minister under David Cameron, made one of the most outspoken and angry speeches. The MP railed against the government for sneaking out the announcement that Britain will pull out of the European nuclear research agency Euratom in the notes accompanying the bill without telling any local MPs or the agency’s staff. He’s also “sick and tired” of being branded as unpatriotic and being against the will of the people for wanting parliament to have more of a say in negotiations. Hywel Williams said that businesses are already pulling out of investing in Wales and confidence is low. “We cannot afford the luxury of time and wait to see what deals we can strike,” he stressed. Steve Baker had a warning for if the bill wasn’t passed they would “suffer the kind of political implosion in this country which we can scarcely imagine”. That’s it for tonight. We’ll be back tomorrow so you can follow the rest of the debate ahead of the vote. Thanks so much for joining us today and for all your comments. Sorry I haven’t been able to directly respond. Several Labour MPs have now said they will defy party orders not to block Theresa May from starting the Brexit process, amid criticism of the government’s approach. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn may find a few surprises in the list of those planning to vote against the bill. Shadow foreign minister Catherine West said she felt not voting for the bill’s second reading is the “only way to make the Government listen” to her concerns. Former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said he would go against a three-line whip on a bill for the first time in nearly 20 years as an MP. Maria Eagle, also a former minister, blamed the Government’s approach for her opposition. A handful of other backbenchers followed, including Jo Stevens, who quit as shadow Welsh secretary over her party’s Brexit approach and compared triggering Article 50 to a “funeral”. Hywel Williams says those who think Brexit will be all done and dusted after article 50 is triggered, need to be aware that this is going to be a marathon not a dash. The Plaid Cymru MP says no matter how many special relationships May “scrapes” or deals she does, we’re not going to get as good a deal as the single market can offer. Businesses are already pulling out of investing in Wales and confidence is low. “We cannot afford the luxury of time and wait to see what deals we can strike,” he says. “If agriculture, which is back bone of my country, is threatened then what kind of future will we have?” He says his language and culture is at risk. He finishes with a question for the government: “How much lamb can we possibly sell to New Zealand?” Tory MP Steve Baker, who is pro-Brexit, says if MPs refused to pass the bill then they would “suffer the kind of political implosion in this country which we can scarcely imagine”. The MP for Wycombe says: “If we were to go ahead and refuse this bill, I believe that even our own party on this side would suffer grave consequences. It’s in all of our interests that this bill passes.” In her speech, Labour former minister Maria Eagle bemoaned the lack of consultation, adding the “nature of the exit” the government appears to be pursuing has also influenced her decision to vote against the second reading of the bill tomorrow night. “The new Government has acted as though the referendum gives them carte blanche to engineer the most extreme kind of arrangements for the UK leaving the EU, though in truth it asked only whether voters wish to remain or leave and had nothing to say about the subsequent arrangements the UK should adopt.” She says: “I think that this extreme right-wing exit without any authorisation from this Parliament or the people of this country that they’re pursuing will damage the jobs and economy of the UK, will undermine our standing and position in the world and will hit the poorest – like many who live and work in my constituency – the hardest.” Ed Vaizey, the former minister for culture, communications and creative industries launched an outspoken attack on the government in his speech. The Tory MP for Wantage and Didcot says he is “so angry” after ministers snuck out the announcement that Britain will pull out of the European nuclear research agency Euratom in the notes accompanying the Bill to trigger Article 50 without telling the staff affected. Vaizey, says scientists working on the cutting edge of nuclear research have been left fearing for their jobs and homes after the shock announcement. “I am so angry with the government on its position about Euratom. Not a single minister contacted me, the honourable member for Oxford West and Abingdon, and honourable member for Henley, the Culham Research Centre with the Joint European Torus, employing hundreds of people at the heart of nuclear fusion research. “We have all been inundated with countless emails from people who now literally believe their job is going. I’ve got the European Space Agency in my constituency. If the government is going to make an announcement like that in the explanatory notes of a bill at least they could alert relevant MPs beforehand, and at least they could provide my constituents with a definitive statement about what the future of European co-operation on civil nuclear engineering is going to be.” He used the end of his speech to list other things that are irritating him including the myth that on the first day out of the EU “we will be handed a suite of lovely trade deals and we will simply sign them. He says when we try and sign a deal with the US, especially the deals on agriculture and manufacturing, there will be protests and demos like we have never seen. The government should be honest and admit it will take years to negotiate these deals “so please don’t insult our intelligence” by pretending we will be signing them on day one. He is also unhappy about remainers such as himself constantly being branded as unpatriotic and he is “sick and tired” that to ask that the government be held to account, that it feeds back to MPs every three months and that it publishes a white paper, is somehow going against the will of the people. Labour’s former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said earlier that he would go against a three-line whip on a bill for the first time in nearly 20 years as an MP. He said: “The Government has made absolutely clear that the only choice, then, will be between its hard Brexit and WTO [World Trade Organisation] rules. This could be our only chance to prevent the hardest of Brexits, or to soften its blow. I cannot and will not vote to destroy jobs and prosperity in my constituency.” The Exeter MP added he was “disappointed and saddened” his party had imposed a three-line whip, given the lack of time available to debate the bill. Wes Streeting, Labour MP says he would be supporting the Bill on a point of democratic principle. “I’d just say to my party that if we want to be in government again, and we want to create the world that we want to see, we must first engage with the world as it is,” he says. “The reality of where we find ourselves today is that people have chosen to put this country on a very different course, outside the European Union.” He spoke of the promises made in the campaign including the £350m-a-week NHS funding pledge which was splashed across campaign buses, which he says the Leave side hate to be reminded of. It was a promise that swayed many Labour votes and staff of the NHS and they expect the promise to be fulfilled. He says: “Brexit means Brexit but also £350 million a week for the NHS means £350 million a week for the NHS”. He will vote for the bill but stressed that May has a duty to ensure parliament has a say in negotiations. It would be an outrage, he says, if parliaments in other European countries and the EU parliament itself got to vote on the deal before this parliament. “How can it be taking back control if their voices and their votes carried more than this parliament?,” he says. Nick Chalk, a Tory MP who campaigned to remain says true democrats, like himself, will vote for the bill. The voter turnout was high, he says, because we were asking for direct instruction. He would have preferred to stay in the single market but has come to realise it was never a realistic option. “I’m a European, I’m a Briton and I’m also a democrat,” he concludes. Labour’s Heidi Alexander, who tabled an amendment to throw out the Bill, said she would vote against it because she was “ashamed” of May’s rhetoric around immigration and the single market. The former shadow health secretary says: “Democracy did not start or end on June 23. It is a process and not an event. There were circumstances in which I would have voted to trigger Article 50. The prime minister killed off that prospect for me when she made her speech in Lancaster House. “A speech in which she said she would pull us out of the single market, a speech in which she put her desire to reduce immigration above our country’s economic interest, and a speech in which she threatened the countries closest to us with a trade war if she didn’t get her way. “I was ashamed of the words of the British prime minister on that day and I resolved then to vote against the triggering of Article 50.” She echoes Lammy by saying that we have an urgent need to find solutions to the NHS and social care crisis, but Brexit will mean “you can kiss goodbye to those things. Endless hours will be spent recreating systems that currently work well ... Brexit will suck all the energy from Whitehall and Westminster” She finishes with a rousing end to her speech and says she will vote against the bill. “Now is not the time to be making threats and burning bridges. My country comes first.” Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion also makes a powerful speech, saying she speaks for her constituency and all those who continue to be “desperately concerned”. She criticises the way May has moved towards what she calls an extreme Brexit. She says we are being forced to make trade deals with “any despot we can find” from Turkey to “a divisive and dangerous US president who the prime minister unable or unwilling to stand up to”. She says nobody voted for us to be a tax haven, “clinging onto the coat tails of Trump’s America”. She says that the issue of the environment has been conspicuous by its absence in all the debates. Environment regulation as strong as what the EU offers is needed. Some people are claiming that people who voted to leave didn’t know what they were voting for, Stuart Andrew, Tory MP for Pudsey says. That shows some complete arrogance and real misunderstanding of people’s concerns and frustrations, he says. Claims that people voted to leave out of racism or prejudice really angered him. “That is frankly disgraceful,” he says. “We are not little Englanders. We are now big Britainers.” David Lammy has made one of the most passionate speeches of the debate. He says a hard Brexit will mean that there will be no capacity to deal with the hard pressed issues highlighted in the Brexit campaign such as problems in the NHS and the housing crisis. He says: “It is the easy option to blame migrants who have come here with skills instead of successive governments, both Conservative and Labour, who have failed. Failed to educate our own to compete, failed to build affordable housing, failed to fund our public services, and failed to ensure growth is felt outside London and the South East. “A hard Brexit won’t deal with any of the long-standing structural problems highlighted by the Brexit vote, it will make these worse.” He also says: “[Tories] salivate at the thought of becoming a tax haven like Singapore. But the poorest will be the ones to suffer and many of them are in my constituency.” He finishes by quoting both Winston Churchill and Enoch Powell. “How far have things fallen when a black member of parliament has to quote Enoch Powell?” he asks. Powell, he says, made the same false warnings about immigration as Brexiteers 50 years ago – and notes he was wrong. He says he will be voting against the bill. “Patriotism is about more than just blind faith,” he concludes. Here is a summary of where we stand so far. MPs have now spent almost seven hours debating historic legislation which will trigger the start of Britain’s departure from the European Union, with little enthusiasm and considerable anxiety. Although some pro-leave MPs have spoken with jubilation, claiming this marks a landmark moment in British history, generally there has been very little triumphalism, and the overall tone has been one of caution and humility. A majority of MPs voted to remain in the EU referendum, and today is a rare example of a legislature voting for something that it doesn’t really want. But, from pro-remain MPs, there is widespread acceptance that, having delegated the decision to the public in the referendum, the Commons ought to accept their verdict. Brexit was supposed to be partly about handing power back to parliament but today it sounded like a subordinate body, not a confident, assertive one. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has so far refused to indicate whether the government will offer further concessions as the bill goes through parliament. Opposition MPs have tabled 85 pages of amendments to the bill, but beyond promising a white paper - now expected on Thursday - Davis has refused to indicate whether he will accept any of them. If Labour and pro-remain Tory MPs do unite around any one demand, it seems most likely to be behind the call for a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, said it was important for MPs to get a vote on the proposals before MEPs. (See 3.38pm.) There is also considerable support from all sides of the House for the rights of EU nationals living in Britain to be guaranteed. But it is not clear whether the opposition have enough rebel Tory support to win votes on these issues when MPs vote on amendments next week. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has defended his party’s decision to vote for the article 50 bill despite the fact most Labour MPs opposed Brexit. His speech was sombre, although mostly heard with respect. Several Labour MPs have confirmed that they will ignore the whip and vote against the bill tomorrow. One estimate puts the number of likely rebels at around 25. There are also some Labour MPs who have said they will vote with Jeremy Corbyn tomorrow, but who have said they reserve the right to vote against the bill at third reading if the government does not accept amendments. The most significant of these potential “third reading” rebels is Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary who is seen as a possible leadership candidate in the future. (See 7.06pm.) The Lib Dems also have their own mini revolt problem, with two of the party’s nine MPs not signing the party’s reasoned amendment. (See 12.33pm.) Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, made a virtuoso speech against the bill, suggesting that Enoch Powell might feel at home in the modern Conservative party and accusing pro-leave campaigners of peddling Alice in Wonderland fantasies. (See 2.40pm). That’s all from me for tonight. My colleague Nicola Slawson will be taking over now. Labour’s Albert Owen says he will support the second reading of the bill with a heavy heart. But he will wait to see whether the bill gets amended at committee stage before deciding what to do at third reading. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, announced last week that he would be voting for the article 50 bill at second reading after it was reported that he was one of the shadow cabinet members particularly unhappy about Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to impose a three-line whip. But he has now confirmed that, if Labour’s amendments are not accepted, he will vote against the bill at third reading and resign from the shadow cabinet. This is from ITV’s Emma Hutchinson. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, says he voted to remain but accepts the result of the referendum. There could be considerable advantages from Brexit, he says. But he says it is important to get a transitional deal. And he says he thinks the UK should continue to have a close, ongoing relationship with the EU after Brexit. Labour’s Steve McCabe says that he will vote for the bill. But he says that is essential that the government agrees to report back to the Commons regularly on how the negotiations are going, so that MPs can insist on changes if a new approach is needed. Turning away from the debate for a moment, it has emerged that Theresa May is hiring a new communications chief. It’s James Slack, who is currently political editor of the Daily Mail. These are from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague. Labour’s Stephen Timms says the government wants to get net migration below 100,000. But the government already has total control of migration from outside the EU, and the figure for net migration from outside the EU is well above 100,000. He says he thinks David Cameron’s problems started when he took the Conservatives out of the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament. That was when they started to lose influence, he says. He says he will be voting against the bill tomorrow night. Quite a few of the earlier posts have now been beefed up with direct quotes, from the Press Association reports. But to get to updates to show you may need to refresh the page. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative, says the 23 June last year will be remembered as a great day in history. It is comparable with Agincourt and Waterloo, he suggests. All MPs are doing is implementing the glorious decision taken by the public in the referendum, he says. The Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney says she will be voting against the bill. She represents a pro-remain constituency for a pro-remain party. But she also thinks leaving the EU will be against the interests of the country. The Conservative MP Claire Perry says she was “appalled” by the quality of the debate during the EU referendum campaign. The leave campaign was “spiced up” by anti-immigration rhetoric. As examples, she cites the Ukip “Breaking Point” poster, and the Vote Leave claims about Turkey joining the EU. Labour’s Liam Byrne says he agrees with with his colleague Jo Stevens said. (See 5.39am.) He says David Cameron is to blame for this. He adopted a Bullingdon Club approach to this: create a terrible mess, throw some money on the table, and expect someone else to clear it up. Tory MPs challenge him over the point about money, reminding him of the note he left before the 2010 general election, when he was chief secretary to the Treasury, saying there was no money. Byrne says since then the national debt has gone up by £500bn. He says he accepts that we are leaving the EU. But he hopes that instead Britain can adopt a more “confederal” approach, cooperating more with EU countries on issues like security, jobs and science. You can read a transcript of the start of the debate here, on the Hansard website. Hansard generally posts speeches about three hours after they have been delivered, and at the moment the Hansard goes up to Anna Soubry’s speech. As the evening goes on, more speeches will be added. Oliver Dowden, a Conservative, says mass immigration has had a profound effect on Britain. People felt they had lost control. David Cameron tried to address this in his renegotiation, but he could not, because EU countries would not abandon free movement. He says Angela Merkel, having been brought up in East Germany, is opposed to border controls. He says, because of his innate conservatism, he did not think it was worth the risk voting to leave the EU. But the people thought otherwise, and their decision must be respected, he says. He says there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future. The SDLP’s Alasdair McDonnell says that he cannot vote for the bill. James Morris, a Conservative, says he was one of the 81 Tories who defied the whip to vote in favour of a referendum in 2011. That seems a long time ago, he says. (It was. Here’s the Guardian’s live blog covering that vote. Our blogs looked very different then. I’ve just had a quick look at my summary from the end of the debate. “Having just sat through it all, it’s hard not to feel that the prospect of a referendum at some point this decade is looking more likely,” I concluded.) Jo Stevens, who resigned as shadow Welsh secretary so she can vote against the bill, says Brexit has led to growing intolerance. Foreign children in her constituency have been spat at, she says. And she says she fears that is what is happening in the US will make matters worse. Some have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, like my friend Suzanne who came to Cardiff from Germany and has a young daughter, Lilleth, who is in primary school, who have been spat at, told to ‘go home’ and had bricks and stones thrown at them in the street. This is the climate that they and we are living in, and I do not believe that it is a coincidence of timing. It is a direct consequence of the referendum campaign. And the events of the past week in the United States make me more fearful of the rapidly developing climate of intolerance in our country. She is particularly critical of David Cameron. He put the interests of his party ahead of the interests of his country when he called the referendum. And then he went to Brussels and failed to get an acceptable deal, she says. She says leaving the EU will be a terrible mistake. The single market is the lifeline to our manufacturing industry - what’s left of it - in steel, automotive and aerospace as well as to our farming and food production sector. So the prime minister’s decision that we are leaving the single market is something I cannot accept. The referendum result last year felt like a body blow. The prime minister’s [Lancaster House] speech felt like the life-support machine being switched off and triggering article 50 will for me feel like the funeral. It is a matter of principle and conscience to me and I must represent the majority of my constituents and share their view - and I will not vote for this bill. Peter Bone, the pro-leave Conservative, says at Tory selection meetings, people are asked if they would put party, country or constituency first. The right answer is country first, then constituency, then party. Normally they go together, he says. But he says the government made a mistake when it tried to use the royal prerogative to justify triggering article 50. Labour’s Catherine West, a shadow Foreign Office minister, says, when she held an advice surgery after the referendum, 500 people came to see her because they were worried about the vote. She used to be a councillor, she says. As a council leader, if she had taken a decision on the basis of a speech and a couple of letters in the papers, she would have been hounded out of office, she says. She says she won’t back the bill. Tom Pursglove, a Conservative pro-leave campaigner, says MPs have talked about Edmund Burke and MPs voting on the basis of their judgment. He says he used his judgment when he voted for the referendum and campaigned for leave. The SNP’s Stephen Gethins asks Pursglove if he used his judgment and stood on a platform represented by a blank piece of paper. Pursglove says the leave campaign did have a policy platform. Labour’s Kate Green says she wants to direct her speech towards her constituents in Stretford and Urmston. She says single market membership it out. But it is not clear what will come instead. She says MPs are being asked to buy a “pig in a poke”. To be asked to endorse an exit process when the outcome is so uncertain is unacceptable, she says. She says she will abstain in the vote tomorrow. But, if the government does not provide proper assurances as the bill goes through its remaining stages, she will vote against it at third reading. She says she has to vote on the basis of her conscience. And the interests of the young will not be well served by her voting for the bill. She says Nick Clegg was right to say MPs should think about how they will be judged in the future. Nigel Evans, the Conservative pro-leave MP, says the government should clear up what will happen to EU nationals living in the UK as soon as possible. The idea that they might be rounded up and put on an easyJet for the continent is despicable. He says it is “cruel” for the European commission to oppose clarifying the rights of these citizens until the Brexit talks start. He says this should be the first issue to be negotiated when the talks start. And, as soon as the a deal is struck, it should be announced. The Conservative MP Neil Carmichael, who was strongly pro-remain, told MPs that being in the EU did not stop the UK trading with the rest of the world. And the SNP MP Deidre Brock criticised the government for refusing to engage with the Scottish government over Brexit. She said the article 50 bill was “childish” and “disrespectful” in its simplicity. In his speech earlier (see 2.42pm) Nick Clegg claimed that Theresa May turned down an offer from Germany for Britain to get the right to have some form of emergency brake over immigration, in return for the country adopting a soft Brexit. The former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister told MPs: Some people say there is no alternative, we must leave the single market, there is no remote chance we could find an accommodation with our European partners. Nonsense. I will confirm to the House that I’ve recently heard on very good authority that senior German decision-makers, shortly after the prime minister [came into office] ... were keen to explore ways to deliver an emergency brake to the new UK prime minister - in return what they hoped for was an undisruptive economic Brexit. But what did this government choose to do? It decided to spurn all friendship links with Europe, it decided to disregard the needs of Scotland, of Northern Ireland and indeed of our great capital here, London. It decided to placate parts of the Conservative party rather than serve the long-term strategic interests of this country. It decided to pander to the eye-popping, vitriol and bile we see every day from people like Mr Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, and the other members of the moneyed elite that run the Brexit right-wing press in this country. This government has become too slavishly preoccupied with their opinions. But above all this government has decided to disregard the hopes, the dreams and aspirations of 16.1m of our fellow citizens. Clegg also criticsed May for her dealings with Donald Trump. He told MPs: The British people did not vote to make themselves poorer by pulling ourselves out of the greatest free trading single market the world has ever seen. The British people most certainly did not give a mandate to the government to indulge in this ludicrous, sycophantic farce we’ve seen in recent days in which this government - having burnt every bridge left with our friends in Europe - rushes across the Atlantic to sidle next to a US president, who they don’t seem to be aware whose nativism, whose isolationism, whose protectionism is diametrically opposed to the long-term strategic interests of the United Kingdom. The quotes are from the Press Association. Labour’s Emma Reynolds says the government has still not said when its promised vote on the final Brexit deal would take place. She says the government should unilaterally guaranteed the rights of EU nationals living in Britain. But it should also propose a preferential controlled immigration system, giving EU nationals preference over non-EU nationals. She says she and her Labour colleague Stephen Kinnock have published proposals for a two-tier system, with skilled EU migrants free to come to the UK if they have a job, but controls on the number of low-skilled workers admitted. And she defends voting for the bill. I campaigned to remain in the EU, but I accept the result of the referendum and I will be voting for this bill tomorrow evening. The leader of the Liberal Democrats calls this cowardly. I call it democracy. We held a national referendum. Those of us on the remain side might not like the result, but we have to accept it. Michael Gove, the Conservative former justice secretary and leading Vote Leave campaigner, provokes laughter when he says “all of us” are concerned about “raucous populism”. He singles out the Liberal Democrats in particular for criticism, saying they cannot be called democratic when they oppose the outcome of the referendum. He says MPs calling for a white paper are not saying what sort of Brexit they want. Instead, they are trying to re-run the referendum, he says. Anna Soubry, the Conservative, asks Gove is he still stands by the claim that leaving the EU could save £350m a week for the NHS. Or will he accept that was a lie? Gove says he is not in government, so he cannot decide how the money saved is spent. But he says Vote Leave said £100m a week would go to the NHS. Vote Leave also wanted extra money to go to science, and VAT on fuel to be cut. He says: I’ve no idea whether or not the word lie is unparliamentary, but what I do know is that as someone who is not in the government, I can’t deliver these sums. But what I can do is I can consistently argue, as I have, that when we take back control of the money that we currently give to the European Union, we can invest that money in the NHS. In fact, it was the consistent claim of the Leave campaign, as she well knows, that we should wish to give £100m to the NHS. Some of the money that we were going to take back control of we would also use to spend on supporting science, and also on making sure that we can get rid of VAT on fuel - something that we cannot do while we are still members of the European Union. Labour’s Angela Smith asks Gove if he will lobby for the extra money to go to the NHS. Gove says he is calling for that. He says he wants Brexit to be liberal, open and inclusive. Britain should lower tariffs for developing nations and help them advance. Britain can play a leading role in the world, he says. That includes standing tall against President Putin. Labour’s Clive Efford says he agrees with almost everything Kenneth Clarke said in his speech. But he says he will back the bill because he sees the need to accept the result of the referendum. And he calls for more accountability. He says it is “folly” to assume, as leave campaigners do, that the UK can fall out of the EU and rely on World Trade Organisations trading terms without the economy suffering. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former Cabinet Office minister, says he is opposed to parliament getting the option of voting to keep the UK in the EU later in the Brexit process. He says if MPs were to amend the bill to retain the option of having a vote on the Brexit deal that could lead to the UK staying in the EU, then the other EU states would have an incentive to offer the UK a deal so bad that parliament would vote to stay in. That is why tomorrow’s vote should be final, he says. He says he will be backing the bill with “some doubt and hesitation”. But he will back it because he thinks MPs have to accept the results of the referendum. The New Statesman’s George Eaton has written an interesting blog about Sir Keir Starmer’s speech at the start of the debate. He says he thinks Brexit will be a key issue in the next Labour leadership contest. Here’s an extract: At the next Labour leadership election, Brexit, which will define British politics for a decade or more, will be a central issue. Clive Lewis, the ambitious and energetic shadow business secretary, could yet aid his cause by voting against article 50. Starmer, another prospective leader, will hope for more than one reason that he does not. It was Labour, not the Conservatives, that was the original eurosceptic party in British politics. After the 1975 referendum split Harold Wilson’s government, Michael Foot backed EEC withdrawal just six years later. It was Jacques Delors’s 1988 address to the Trades Unions Congress that led Labour to embrace Europe as a counterweight to Thatcherism (and the Tories to concurrently shun it). Today, as he drew the curtain on decades of EU support, Starmer appealed for a “good deal less of the gloating from those who voted to Leave”. But as Labour grapples with its Brexit plight, his wish is unlikely to be granted. Chris Leslie, the Labour former shadow chancellor, says he cannot support the bill when there are so many questions about what happens. He says he has tabled amendments to get more clarity from the government about its plans. He thinks the government is heading for a hard Brexit, he says. He says he would like to see more fight from all MP, including from the Labour leadership, to get a better outcome. MPs should be trying to steer Theresa May away from a hard Brexit, he says. Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary and a leading pro-leave figure, says the establishment is refusing to accept the result of the referendum.

Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ The New Statesman’s Stephen Bush has a useful guide to which MPs are likely to vote against the article 50 bill. He has tweeted a link to it. Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP and leading Vote Leave campaigner, says she helped to draft the original article 50, when it was part of what was then a proposed constitution. She says it was originally intended as an expulsion clause. But the EU can never drop an idea, and that is why it ended up in the Lisbon treaty. She says she thinks a unilateral decision to offer EU nationals the right to stay in the UK would help to ensure a successful negotiation. Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, goes next. And his entire speech consists of one sentence. The people have decided, and I’m going to vote accordingly. Labour’s Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, says she cannot back a bill like this with so little detail. And she says the government should declare that EU nationals in the Britain now can stay. The Conservative Nigel Evans suggests what EU nationals are experiencing is like torture. He says: I think it’s actually tantamount to torture to not tell people who are from the EU living and working here that they cannot stay, as it is for British people living and working in the European Union. Do you not believe that both sides ought to get together as quickly as possible and put people out of their misery, and tell them that they’re allowed to stay, live and work in the country where they currently are? Hillier accepts that. She says the government should guarantee their rights unilaterally. She says: I would agree with that position but I believe the government could go further and make a unilateral declaration. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says when he was in government he found plenty of aspects of the EU to criticise. But he never thought the UK should leave, and he does not think that now. In fact, the potential problems of leaving are considerable, he says. He says, although the government wants to maintain good relations with the EU, leaving will make this harder. He says he will support the government. Trying to obstruct the wishes of the electorate would create more uncertainty, he says. He says many of the amendments tabled to the bill seem to be about micro-managing the Brexit process. He does not support that, he says. But he says the government should follow proper process. He says the government must publish its white paper before the bill gets its committee stage debate. And he says parliament should get to consider the final deal. And it should vote on that before the deal gets put to the European parliament. Grieve says MPs should get vote on proposed final Brexit deal before the European parliament votes on it. He ends saying he thinks the country is making a “grave error”. I think we have made a grave error and I think it is one that will become more and more apparent with the passage of time. Here is a Guardian video with an extract from Kenneth Clarke’s speech earlier. The DUP’s Sammy Wilson is speaking now. He says MPs should accept the results of the referendum. If Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland were given a veto over the result, that would be detrimental to the integrity of the United Kingdom, he says. It would be detrimental to the Union if we had a situation where Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland had the right to say to the people of the whole of the United Kingdom ‘we don’t care how you voted, the 1.8m people in Northern Ireland have a right to veto how the rest of the people in the United Kingdom express their views’. That would be detrimental to the Union. The SNP’s Ian Blackford says Scotland does not want a veto. It just wants to ensure that it can stay in, even if the rest of the UK leaves. Wilson suggests that amounts to the same thing. Sir Edward Leigh, a pro-leave Conservative, says it should be easy for the UK to sign a free trade deal with the EU after Brexit. He thinks Brexit will enable the UK to strengthen links with the rest of Europe, not to weaken them, he says. I sincerely believe that this process is not a triumph of nationalism, of us being apart from them. I believe it is quite the opposite. I believe it is part of a new internationalism and recognising our common citizenship of the whole world. I think that we stand ready to break free of the protectionist barriers the EU has erected which have so damaged much of the third world, and rejoin the world at large. As a former prime minister of Australia made clear - Britain is back. Turning away from the article 50 debate for a moment, it has just been announced that there will be a debate on the petition calling for Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK to be cancelled. It will take place at 4.30pm on Monday 20 February. It will be in Westminster Hall, not the main Commons chamber, and it will just be a debate; there will not be a vote. It will last for up to three hours. The debate has been triggered by this petition, saying that Trump should not get a state visit, which has been signed by 1.7m people online. It says Trump should be allowed to visit the UK but that he should not get a state visit “because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.” But MPs will also consider a rival petition saying Trump should get a state visit. That has just been signed by 116,000 people. Dame Rosie Winterton, the former Labour chief whip, is speaking now. She challenges the government to give an assurance that it will not withdraw from the European convention on human rights and the council of Europe. John Redwood, the Conservative pro-leave campaigner, goes next. He says people voted to take back control when they voted to leave the EU in the referendum. Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour MP, says Redwood is saying that the forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy were wrong. But what does he say to the argument that that is like falling of a building and saying things are fine because you have not hit the ground yet. Redwood says he does not accept that analogy. People argued that Brexit would lead to a recession this winter. But it has not happened, he says. He says if remain had won, he would have stood down as an MP. He would not have seen the point of carrying on because parliament would have carried on having so little power. Now, all those good laws Europe is supposed to have given us, we can keep them for ourselves, he says. What is it about freedom that the other side do not like? He urges MPs to vote to make parliament sovereign, as the people have urged them to do. Kate Hoey, the Labour pro-leave campaigner, is speaking now. She says she is fed up with the argument that people who voted to leave did not know what they were voting for. That patronising attitude helps to explain why people wanted to vote leave. Iain Duncan Smith, her Conservative leave colleague, intervenes. People were more engaged in the referendum campaign than in any election he has taken part in, he says. Hoey agrees. She says she also wants to challenge the idea that leave voters were, if not outright racists, then implicit racists. That is wrong, she says. I’m adding some direct quotes to some of the earlier posts, using quotes filed by the Press Association. But to get the updates to appear you may need to refresh the page. Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, is speaking now. She says she will vote for the bill “with a heavy heart” because she said she would respect the result of the referendum. She says she does not think history will be kind to this government or this parliament. Why did it put an option to people that would leave them worse off? And she criticises Labour. The party is going against everything it believes in, she says. Labour’s Chris Bryant says his party is grateful for her advice. But was Soubry a member of the government that was committed to cutting net migration below 100,000. Soubry says her views on immigration are well known. She says she thinks students should be excluded from the migration figures. There have been speeches from Hilary Benn, Iain Duncan Smith, Nick Clegg, Cheryl Gillan and Dame Margaret Beckett while I was writing up the summary and analysis. I will post the highlights of their speeches shortly. UPDATE: Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, said in his speech that, although he was pro-remain, he thought MPs should respect the result of the referendum. Though it pains me to say it, we are leaving the European Union and our task now is to try and bring people together. And that means that, whether we voted leave or we voted remain, we have a responsibility to hold in our minds the views and the concerns and the hopes of everyone in this country - whether they voted leave or remain. The supreme court, rightly in my view, decided that a decision of this magnitude should be taken by parliament not by the executive. But with that power comes a responsibility - to respect the outcome of the referendum however much some of us may disagree with it. This is about democracy, it is about faith in our politics. He also criticised the government for not publishing a white paper, or an economic analysis of the impact of Brexit. “This is not the way to do things and it is an attitude that has to change,” he said. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and former work and pensions secretary, responded to Kenneth Clarke’s claim that leave campaigner had an Alice in Wonderland vision of what it would be like outside the EU. He said: I would say we are not the [Mad] Hatter’s tea party, I think the Hatter’s tea party is sitting in the opposition at the moment. It’s not known who the mouse is or who the hatter is but I’m sure they’ll tell us later on. Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, claimed Theresa May turned down a soft Brexit compromise offer from Germany involving and “emergency brake” on immigration. See 4.42pm for more details. Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour former foreign secretary, said a transitional deal was essential. These negotiations that we trigger with this bill will be extraordinarily difficult and they will be very time consuming. I personally do not think for a second that they can be concluded within two years and I don’t think anybody who has ever negotiated anything would. It will be vital therefore to allow us to make preparation for possible transitional arrangements. So far this hasn’t been a debate that really carries the full weight of the historical choice that is being taken. Kenneth Clarke’s speech was superb, but the two opening speeches, from David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Sir Keir Starmer, his Labour opposite number, were underwhelming. Neither of them had anything particularly revealing to announce, and the passion in what they had to say was a bit muted. Perhaps the debate will liven up more as it goes along. Here are the key points from the opening speeches. Starmer said Labour wanted the government to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK now, unilaterally, because attempts to reach a deal on this with other EU countries have so far failed. The government wants a deal that will guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK as well as those of Britons living on the continent. But, Starmer, told MPs: That has not worked and now the prime minister should act unilaterally to give assurance to those EU nationals living in this country. Davis said the government might seek to retain some link with Euratom, the European body that regulates the civil nuclear industry. The government’s explanatory notes to the article 50 bill make it clear that leaving the EU also means leaving Euratom. In the debate Labour’s John Woodcock said this could put thousands of jobs at a new nuclear power station in Cumbria at risk. He asked Davis to keep an open mind on staying in Euratom, telling him: There is a danger that there will be years of uncertainty that could put at risk the 21,000 new jobs which are slated to come as part of the Moorside development [in Cumbria], as well as many others across the UK. Davis said he understood Woodcock’s point. And he hinted that the UK could remain linked to Euratom. He said: If it is not possible to come to a conclusion with some sort of relationship with Euratom, then we will no doubt be able to do one with the international atomic energy authority, possibly the most respectable international body in the world. Starmer said Labour wanted Britain to stay in various EU agencies. The ones he cited were the European aviation safety agency, the European medicines agency, Europol or Eurojust. (See 1.24pm.) Starmer said this bill was “very difficult” for Labour because so many Labour MPs wanted to stay in the EU. But the party had to accept the result of the referendum, he said: We share values and identity with the EU. But we failed to persuade, we lost the referendum. Yes, the result was close, yes, there were lies and half-truths - none worse than the false promise of 350 million a week to the NHS. Yes, technically the referendum is not legally binding but the result was not technical - it was deeply political. And politically the notion that the referendum was merely a consultation exercise to inform parliament holds no water. When I was imploring people up and down the country to vote in the referendum and vote to remain, I told them their vote really mattered, that a decision was going to be made. I was not inviting them to express a view. And although we’re fiercely internationalist, fiercely pro-European, we in the Labour party are, above all, democrats. Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said that he would vote against the bill and that he did not see why pro-Europeans like himself should have to accept the result of the referendum. He told MPs: Let me give an analogy in explaining the position for members of parliament after this referendum. I have fought Lord knows how many election over the past 50 years and I have always advocated voting Conservative. The British public in their wisdom have occasionally failed to take my advice and they have actually by a majority voted Labour. And I have found myself here facing a Labour government. I do not recall an occasion where I was told it was now my democratic duty to support Labour policies under Labour governments on the other side of the House. That proposition would have been treated with ridicule and scorn. Clarke also mocked the idea that leaving the single market and the customs union would be good for the economy. We are combining withdrawal from the single market and the customs union with this great new globalised future, which offers tremendous opportunities for us. Apparently you follow the rabbit down the hole and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries around the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets that previously we had never been able to achieve as part of the European Union. Nice men like President Trump and President Erdogan are just impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access. Don’t let me be too cynical - I hope that is right. I want the best outcome for the United Kingdom from this process. No doubt there is somewhere a Hatter holding a tea party with a dormouse. Clarke suggested Enoch Powell might be comfortable with the modern Conservative party. I feel the spirit of my former colleague - who I rather respected, apart from one or two extreme views - my former colleague Enoch Powell, the best speaker of the Eurosceptic cause I’ve probably ever heard in this House of Commons. If he was here he would probably find it amazing to believe that his party had become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a strange way in 2016, and I’m afraid on that I haven’t followed them and I don’t intend to do so. Davis said MPs who voted against the bill would be defying the wishes of the people. He told MPs: The eyes of the nation are on this chamber as we consider this Bill. For many years there’s been a creeping sense in the country - and not just this country - that politicians say one thing and do another. We voted to give the people the chance to determine our future at a referendum; now we must honour our side of the agreement - to vote to deliver on the result. So really we are considering that very simple question - do we trust the people or not? John Bercow, the Speaker, announced that the SNP’s reasoned amendment will be put to a vote tomorrow night. Four other reasoned amendments will not be put a vote. (See 12.33pm.) Defending his party’s amendment, Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s Europe spokesman, said: Europe is where our future still lies. One where we tackle inequality, climate change, research, welcome refugees, give young people the opportunities – pooling our sovereignty with like-minded states. That is the kind of Scotland I believe in and one where we work as a true partner of equals with the other States of the UK and Europe. Passing this bill would turn its back on the progress we have made and disrespect the devolution settlement. This is a backward and damaging step. It is an act of constitutional and economic sabotage and I cannot and will not back it. The “front bench” speeches are now over. (Stephen Gethins does not sit on the front bench, but he is allowed extra time as the SNP spokesman.) John Bercow now imposes a six-minute limit on speeches. Bill Cash, the Conservatives, goes next. He says that he has been campaigning for this for 30 years. When the Single European Act was being passed, he tried to include an amendment making UK law sovereign. His amendment was not called. But the article 50 bill now implements what he wanted, he says. He says the bill represents a landmark in British history. For me, this referendum was a massive, peaceful revolution by consent of historic proportions. This bill, at last, endorses that revolution. From the 17th century right the way through our history, through the Corn Laws, through the Parliamentary Reform Act, which gave the vote to the working class, the Suffragettes, who got the vote in 1928, and then again in the period of appeasement, these have all been great benchmarks of British history. Gethins says Scotland having to share Trident when it does not want it is not sovereignty. And being taken out of the EU when the country did not vote for it is not sovereignty either, he says. He says Europe is where the future lies. MPs should vote for the SNP amendment (see 12.33pm), he says. Otherwise voting for this bill is a backward step, he says. Sheryll Murray, a Conservative, asks how the government can be expected to produce a 670-page white paper on a two-clause bill. Gethins says he would settle for something shorter. He says the explanatory notes to the bill say it is not expected to have financial implications. That is a brave assumption, he says. Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s Europe spokesman, is speaking now. He praises Kenneth Clarke’s speech, and says he is glad that Clarke will be voting with the SNP tomorrow. He says the government should have published its white paper before the debate. Holding up a copy of the SNP government’s white paper, he says this is what a proper white paper looks like. It contained 670 pages, he says. A Tory MP points out that that white paper did not say what currency an independent Scotland would use. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Conservative, says the Scottish people gave it a “raspberry”. Clarke is now paraphrasing Edmund Burke. Burke said, if MPs do not vote with their consciences, they are betraying their constituents, not serving them, he says. Clarke finishes. Some MPs applaud by clapping, which is something that only happens rarely in the Commons because it is not technically allowed. Here are some MPs praising his speech. From Labour’s Angela Eagle From Labour’s Ben Bradshaw From Labour’s Liz McInnes From the SNP’s Owen Thompson Clarke says he is normally a loyal Conservative. He last voted against the party over the Lisbon treaty (which the then Labour government backed, but the Tory opposition did not.) He says he is just being loyal to the policy his party has backed for 50 years. He says Enoch Powell was the best Eurosceptic speaker he ever heard. Powell would have been surprised to see his party become Eurosceptic and mildly anti-immigrant. Clarke says he has always urged people to vote Conservative. But sometimes Labour won elections. He cannot recall anyone arguing then that it was his duty to support Labour policies. But this is what people are telling him now. People are claiming he is being an “enemy of the people” by standing by what he supported during the campaign. He says he is sure that none of the hardline Eurosceptics would have accepted the result if they had lost. If he were ever to see Bill Cash turn up in the Commons and vote for the EU, he would change his mind, he says. Clarke says leaving the EU will be a “very, very bad move”, especially for our children and grandchildren. Brexit is “baffling” to other countries around the world. He address the claim that he should back the bill because people voted for Brexit in the referendum. Fortunately, he says, he has always been opposed to referendums throughout his career (so he is being consistent). He says he does not think it is appropriate to decide so many complicated issues in such a fashion. Other countries don’t use referendums, he says. He says during the campaign both sides were “pathetic”. He and his friend David Davis assure themselves that neither of them used some of the “dafter” arguments used on both sides. He cites the £350m a week for the NHS claim, and the claim that Brexit would require an emergency budget. I won’t comment on the nature of the campaign; those arguments that got publicity in the national media on both sides - both sides - were on the whole fairly pathetic. I have agreed in conversation with [David Davis] that he and I can both tell ourselves that neither of us used the dafter arguments being used by the people were allied with, where there was not a serious debate. I don’t recall £350m a week for the health service coming from the secretary of state for Brexit and I didn’t say we were going to have a budget to put up income tax - all quite pathetic. Clarke says Britain has contributed considerably to the development of the EU. It played a big role in promoting the single market, he says. Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, says he will be voting against the bill. He says, given Labour’s inability to oppose the bill, he is the first MP to speak in favour of Britain staying in the EU. He says his political career has coincided with EU membership. He started his career backing Harold Macmillan’s campaign to join. And his last parliament could be the one in which he leaves. Clarke hints that he may retire as an MP at the end of this parliament. UPDATE: Actually, megs in the comments BTL points out that Clarke has previously said this will be his last parliament. Starmer says he repects the views of those Labour MPs who cannot vote to trigger article 50. He says MPs have to respect the views of the electorate. But he says they have to deliver a Brexit that works not just for the 52% who voted for Brexit, but for everyone. Starmer says Theresa May has said the UK should not try to retain membership of bits of the EU. But that is wrong, he says, as the concerns raised about Euratom earlier shows. He also asks why the UK would want to leave the European aviation safety agency, the European medicines agency, Europol or Eurojust. Why would we want to be outside the European Aviation Safety Agency which certifies aircraft before they are allowed to fly? Why would we want to be outside of the European Medicines Agency which ensures all medicines in the EU are safe and effective? Starmer says Labour wants UK to stay in some EU agencies. Anna Soubry, the Conservative, puts it to Starmer that all options should be open to MPs when they vote on the Brexit deal after it is concluded. She says: Do you share my concerns that at the end of this process if there is no deal that has been struck, all options must remain open and it will be for this place and not for the Government to decide what happens next? Starmer says Labour wants to ensure that there is “meaningful” vote at that point. The Spectator’s Isabel Hardman posted this on Twitter. And that prompted this comment from the SNP MP Ian Blackford. Starmer says he accepts that the government has tried to make progress on the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. But that approach has not worked, he says. He says he has had EU nationals in his constituency surgery in tears. He expects other MPs have had the same experience. The government should now unilaterally give EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay, he says. Starmer says government should unilaterally give EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay. Starmer says when he campaigned in the referendum, he told people they were taking a decision. He did not say they were just expressing a view. Labour is internationalist, he says. But above all they are democrats. So they must accept the result of the referendum, he says. But Labour will not just let the government do whatever it wants. It has tabled amendments, requiring regular parliamentary scrutiny of the bill. Here is the summary of the Labour amendments that the party produced in a news release last week. (Bold type from Labour.) 1 - Allow a meaningful vote in Parliament on the final Brexit deal. Labour’s amendment would ensure that the House of Commons has the first say on any proposed deal and that the consent of Parliament would be required before the deal is referred to the European Council and Parliament. 2 - Establish a number of key principles the Government must seek to negotiate during the process, including protecting workers’ rights, securing full tariff and impediment free access to the Single Market. 3 - Ensure there is robust and regular Parliamentary scrutiny by requiring the Secretary of State to report to the House at least every two months on the progress being made on negotiations throughout the Brexit process 4 - Guarantee legal rights for EU nationals living in the UK. Labour has repeatedly called for the Government to take this step, and this amendment would ensure EU citizens’ rights are not part of the Brexit negotiations. 5 - Require the Government to consult regularly with the governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout Brexit negotiations. Labour’s amendment would put the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) on a statutory footing and require the UK Government to consult the JMC at least every two months. 6 - Require the Government to publish impact assessments conducted since the referendum of any new proposed trading relationship with the EU. This amendment seeks to ensure there is much greater clarity on the likely impact of the Government’s decision to exit the Single Market and seek new relationship with the Customs Union 7 - Ensure the Government must seek to retain all existing EU tax avoidance and evasion measures post-Brexit Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. This is a short bill and a simple one, he says. But for Labour it is a very difficult bill. This provokes lots of jeering. He urges MPs to be courteous. Labour is internationalist and pro-European, he says. It believes in international collaboration and the rule of law. That is why it campaigned to stay in the EU. But they lost the referendum, he says. Yes, there were lies and half truths, none worse than the claim that leaving the EU would release £350m a week for the NHS, he says. Davis says MPs must pass this legislation swiftly. The eyes of the nation are on this chamber as it considers this bill, he says. MPs gave the decision to the public. Now they must honour their side of the agreement and implement what the people decided. He commends the bill to the House, he says. “Trust the people.” Davis says there must be no attempts to remain in the EU, no attempts to remain in by the back door and no second referendum. The SDLP’s Alasdair McDonnell says Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU. But it does not have devolved bodies at the moment (because there is an election underway). Davis says the government has guaranteed that it will retain the common travel area. And, although there is no Northern Ireland executive, ministers are still in place. They attend joint ministerial committee meetings. Davis says the government has paid “a great deal of attention” to the proposals from the devolved assemblies. And he says the government is ready to do a deal “now” on the rights of EU nationals to remain in the UK after Brexit if other EU countries agree. The Lib Dem Tom Brake asks when the government will publish its assessment of the impact of leaving on jobs. Davis says the claims made by people like Brake about the economic impact of Brexit during the referendum turned out to be wrong. Davis says, since the government will move the entire EU acquis (body of EU law) into UK law, MPs will get the chance to vote on any changes from EU law. He says he views the terms hard Brexit and soft Brexit as “terms of propaganda”. Davis says the government has set out its objectives for the Brexit negotiations. He says the white paper with the government’s plan for Brexit will be published soon, “as soon as is reasonably possible”. Chris Philp, the Conservative, says his former Oxford physics tutor asked him to lobby the government to see if it could delay leaving Euratom. Davis says the government has got two years to negotiate withdrawal, implying that further delay would be unnecessary. Davis says the explanatory notes to the bill say that leaving the EU also involves leaving Euratom. The Commons library briefing paper I mentioned earlier (see 12.30pm) goes into this subject in some detail. Here is an extract. Euratom regulates the civil nuclear industry, including safeguards for nuclear materials and technology, disposal of nuclear waste, ownership of nuclear fuel, and research and development (for instance its major nuclear fusion projects). Euratom is a separate legal entity from the EU, under the 1957 Euratom Treaty, but it is governed by the EU’s institutions (including the Court of Justice of the EU). Remaining in Euratom after leaving the EU “would entail partial membership of EU institutions and would leave significant areas of UK law subject to directives and regulations made in Brussels and (ultimately) interpreted in Luxembourg” ... The Euratom Treaty does not have its own provisions on withdrawal. However, it has been amended to state that Article 50 TEU applies to the Euratom Treaty, with the substitution of the words Euratom and Euratom Treaty where appropriate. This now appears as Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty ... It is hard to envisage how the UK could continue as a Member of Euratom, even for a transitional period, once it has left the EU. Because Euratom uses the EU institutions, the UK would have to find a way to remain part of those institutions where Euratom was concerned. And also the Euratom Treaty states that it applies only on the territory of the EU Member States (Article 198). David Davis, the Brexit secretary, opens the debate. His voice is hoarse, and so he says he will be taking fewer interventions than usual. He starts with the point he briefed overnight, about how the bill just implements a decision already taken by the people. (See 10.33am.) So it is a straightforward bill, he says. He summarises what the two clauses mean. John Bercow, the speaker, says that he has selected the SNP amendment to be put to a vote at the end of the debate tomorrow. (See 12.33pm.) He says 99 backbench MPs want to speak in the debate today. So there will be a “tough time limit”, he says. Philip Davies has finally finished. But he does not try to call a vote opposing Nusrat Ghani’s bill. Nusrat Ghani, a Conservative, has finished proposing her 10-minute rule bill tackling so-called honour killings. MPs expected to be able to move on to the article 50 debate, but the Conservative Philip Davies has got up to give a speech against Ghani’s bill. He says he is against it because it does not cover violence against men too. It is fair to say he does not seem to have the sympathy of the House. The Labour MP Conor McGinn has written a blog explaining why, reluctantly, he will vote to trigger article 50. When a bill gets a second reading in the House of Commons opposition parties can decide simply to vote against. But normally they also table a “reasoned amendment”, saying why the bill should not get a second reading. MPs usually vote on one reasoned amendment before they go on to vote on whether or not the bill should get a second reading. Reasoned amendments almost always fail, but they enable opposition parties to put their objections to a bill on the record. Unusually, with the article 50 bill, five reasoned amendments have been tabled. Here they are in full. The speaker, John Bercow, decides which amendments, if any, get put to a vote. This is normally announced at the start of the debate and, with the Labour front bench not tabling one, it is likely he will call a vote on the SNP version. All the votes will be tomorrow, at 7pm. Here are the five reasoned amendments on the order paper. The SNP one (tabled by the SNP’s Angus Robertson and signed by 60 other MPs from the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the SDLP and the Greens) That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill as the Government has set out no provision for effective consultation with the devolved administrations on implementing Article 50, has yet to publish a White Paper detailing the Government’s policy proposals, has refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, has left unanswered a range of detailed questions covering many policy areas about the full implications of withdrawal from the single market and has provided no assurance that a future parliamentary vote will be anything other than irrelevant, as withdrawal from the European Union followed two years after the invoking of Article 50 if agreement is not reached in the forthcoming negotiations, unless they are prolonged by unanimity. The Green one (tabled by the Green MP Caroline Lucas, but also backed by MPs from the SDLP, Plaid Cymru and SNP) That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill because it fails to provide enduring legal protection to the economic and social interests of the people of the United Kingdom in the event of exit from the European Union, fails in particular to guarantee the UK’s future membership of both the Single Market and the customs union, essential to the future prosperity of the UK, thereby failing to ensure continuation of free movement and the existing reciprocal rights enjoyed by EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in EU member states, fails to guarantee maintenance of environmental regulation at least as strong as current EU regulation, fails to prevent a race to the bottom on corporate taxation and on workers’ and consumers’ rights, fails to guarantee young people rights to work, travel and study in the EU at least equal to those they enjoy now, otherwise fails to adequately address the immense constitutional implications of withdrawal from the EU, including the future of the Good Friday Agreement, fails to adequately address the almost certain need for a transitional arrangement with the EU, and fails to guarantee a Ratification Referendum on any withdrawal agreements negotiated with the other EU member states. The rebel Labour one (tabled by the Labour MP Heidi Alexander and signed by 21 other Labour MPs, as well as by three SDLP MPs) That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill because the Government has failed to give assurances which safeguard British interests in the single market, and because the Government has failed to provide assurance that either Parliament or the UK electorate will have the ability to determine whether the UK should seek to withdraw from the single market in accordance with Article 127 of the EEA Agreement. The Lib Dem one (signed by all nine Lib Dem MPs apart from Norman Lamb and Greg Mulholland) That this House declines to give the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill a Second Reading because it does not provide a mechanism for the people of the United Kingdom to have a vote, prior to the UK’s departure from the European Union, on the terms of the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, because the Government has failed to provide an accompanying white paper detailing a plan or set of principles upon which the United Kingdom Government will seek to negotiate with the European Union, and because the Government has deliberately not tabled a money resolution in respect of this Bill, thereby hampering the elected representatives of the people from amending the Bill to include issues at the heart of public concerns with Brexit. The Plaid Cymru one (tabled by Plaid’s Hywel Williams but also backed by MPs from the SDLP, the SNP and the Greens) That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill as the Government has failed to ensure continued full and unfettered access to the European single market, through participation in the EEA and membership of the EFTA, and has set out no requirement for the implementation of Article 50 to be endorsed by the devolved Parliaments. MPs will be starting the article 50 bill debate in about 10 minutes. Business questions ends at 12.30, and then Nusrat Ghani will move a 10-minute rule bill on violence against women. The debate itself should start at about 12.40pm. The House of Commons library has produced a 50-page briefing paper on the bill. Here is a summary. And here is the full paper (pdf). On 17 February 1972 MPs concluded their debate at the second reading of the European communities bill, the legislation taking the UK into what was then the EEC. Here is the Hansard report of the debate. Harold Wilson, the Labour leader, explained why his party was voting against. Here is an extract from his speech. The biggest issue of all facing the House is that which has dominated every issue of parliamentary freedom for over 700 years—control over the levying of taxes and the appropriation of Exchequer funds, the actions of this House and its paramouncy in Committee of Ways and Means and in Committee of Supply. The Bill in a very real sense transfers a major part of parliamentary control of taxation and appropriation to Brussels, which was not contemplated on anything like this scale when the White Paper of 1967 was laid. Since then we have the whole take-over, food levies on a rapidly rising price scale, all our customs duties—the prerogative of this House from ancient time—and the proceeds of a 1 per cent. value-added tax ... Even if we had today been debating terms which carried the full-hearted consent of the British people—which the Prime Minister manifestly has not got, despite his election pledges, as he has not got the full-hearted consent of Parliament, or we would not have seen him involved in the way he has been this week—all that apart, even if we could all have gone forward on these terms, the Bill raises fundamental issues about the rights of the House and about our parliamentary democracy. We have our duties as parliamentarians, as servants of this House, as inheritors of the rights and powers of this House in our democracy. Because this Government in this Bill treat those duties, those rights and those powers as of no account, we shall cast our vote tonight unhesitatingly against the Bill. The debate was wound up by Edward Heath, the prime minister. Here is an extract from his speech in favour. I have dealt with many of the major issues raised in the debate. I will deal now in particular with one matter. As the House knows, I have always believed that our prosperity and our influence in the world would benefit from membership. I believed until recently that we could carry on fairly well outside, but I believe now that with developments in world affairs, and the speed at which they are moving, it will become more and more difficult for Britain alone. Faced with this prospect of change, I do not believe that any Prime Minister could come to this House and say, “We have secured the chance to join the European Community; we have signed the Treaty of Accession; we have the opportunity of full membership; but I now advise this House to throw them away.” I do not believe that any Prime Minister could say that, and it follows from what I have said that this Bill is not a luxury which we can dispense with if need be. It has been a central policy of three successive Governments, irrespective of party, and of all three main parties in this House that Britain should join the European Communities if suitable arrangements could be negotiated. By a large majority this House decided in principle last October that Britain should join the Community on the basis of the arrangements negotiated by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy. Any Government which thereafter failed to give legislative effect to that clear decision of this House would be abdicating its responsibilities. According to the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn, the government is planning to publish its Brexit white paper on Thursday. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has put out a press statement saying that, if Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK does go ahead, as a protest he will not attend the state dinner at Buckingham Palace. Yesterday it was announced that George Osborne, the former chancellor, has taken up an academic fellowship at the McCain Institute, the organisation set up by the Republican senator John McCain, a critic of Donald Trump. In his first blog as the institute’s inaugural Kissinger Fellow, Osborne has implicitly attacked Trump’s travel ban. He writes (bold type inserted by me): John McCain and Henry Kissinger remind us that the world’s problems will quickly become our own problems if we leave it to others alone to sort them. Erecting trade barriers with our neighbours, making an enemy of our open societies, demonising those seeking a better life, turning away refugees, unravelling the institutions that sustain the west, are not the answer. If the Statue of Liberty turns its back on the world, if Britain retreats behind its island shores, then it is not just others who depend on us who will pay a price – the heavy cost will fall on our own citizens too. According to the Press Association, Osborne will receive a stipend by the McCain Institute, as well as receiving money to cover staff support, travel, convening and conferencing costs. Last night the department for exiting the EU released a very short extract from what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, will say in his speech opening the debate this afternoon. He will tell MPs: It is not a bill about whether or not the UK should leave the EU, or how it should do so. It is simply about implementing a decision already made, a point of no return already passed. We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU; they decided they did. In a briefing note the department also sought to downplay the significance of the bill, saying that it was just one several opportunities for MPs to scrutnise Brexit. The note said: This is one of many moments for parliament to scrutinise the UK’s exit from the EU. A white paper, setting out the negotiation principles, and the great repeal bill, transposing EU law into UK law, have also been announced and will shortly be brought before parliament. The government has also committed to holding a vote on the final deal with the EU, once negotiations are complete. For anyone who is interested, here is the 85-page document (pdf) containing all the amendments that have been tabled to the article 50 bill The Labour MP Matthew Pennycook, a shadow Brexit minister and MP for Greenwich and Woolwich (which voted strongly remain) has written an interesting blog explaining why (unlike Owen Smith) he will not be voting against the article 50 bill. Here’s an extract: Even if the parliamentary arithmetic was such that defeating the bill was a realistic possibility, I am not convinced it would be the right course of action. To seek to nullify the referendum result by parliamentary means risks, in my view, creating further social division, fuelling the rise of the far-right, adding to the alienation already felt by a significant section of the electorate and perhaps even sparking civil unrest in some parts of the country. As such, I respectfully disagree with those who maintain that, whatever the potential negative social and political implications, MPs should seek to overturn the result. It is also worth considering what would happen if the bill were voted down on Wednesday. Far from securing our place in the EU or chastening the hardline Brexiteers, it would almost certainly trigger a snap general election fought solely on the issue of Brexit that in all likelihood would return a Conservative government with an increased majority to enact any form of departure they wish – an outcome I think the present Commons makeup gives us a reasonable chance of avoiding. MPs will debate the article 50 bill’s second reading today and tomorrow and the bill’s remaining stages will take place on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week. In the Lords yesterday Lord Taylor of Holbeach, the government chief whip, said the Lords expected to get the bill either on Wednesday night or Thursday next week. There is a half-term recesss the following week, and Taylor said peers would have their second reading debate on Monday 20 February and Tuesday 21. Two days have been set aside for the bill’s committee stage the following week, he said, on Monday 27 February and Wednesday 1 March. And the bill is then scheduled to have its report stage and third reading on Tuesday 7 March. Taylor would not answer a question about what might happen if the Lords passes amendments that the Commons then rejects, but this would trigger “ping pong” - the process that involves a bill shuttling to and for between the two Houses until one side backs down. In theory that could take place on Wednesday 8 March, but that date is set aside for the budget. In the Times today (paywall) Henry Zeffman and Michael Savage say Theresa May would like to option of being able to trigger article 50 on Thursday 9 March, as she will be able to do if the bill is on the statute book by then. They say: All 28 heads of government from EU member states will meet on March 9 at the two-day European council summit in Malta, giving Mrs May an opportunity to invoke the clause. On March 8 Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will present his first budget. Ministers are thought to be sensitive to invoking article 50 in the last week of March — March 25 will be the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the founding charter of what became the EU. The row about Theresa May’s decision to invite Donald Trump to the UK for a state visit shows no signs of abating. But, for the sake of clarity, we are covering that story on our separate Trump travel ban live blog, which my colleague Matthew Weaver is now writing. It includes details of how Lord Ricketts, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, has suggested delaying Trump’s state visit by up to three years to save the Queen embarrassment. Forty five years after MPs debated the bill that took Britain into what was then the EEC, the moment that campaigners have either been longing for or dreading has finally arrived; MPs will this afternoon start debating a piece of legislation that will take us out. The bill itself is remarkably short, running to just 137 words. It covers a four-page sheet which I’ve got on my desk, but one page is blank, and another page comprises just the title. Here is the text of the bill itself. Beside it I have also got a rather longer document, the notice of amendments. This is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled by MPs and opposition parties and it runs to 85 pages. MPs will debate them, and vote on a select few, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week. That, in theory, is when the debate should get most interesting, because at that point the bill can be changed. Except now it is looking as looking as if the bill may pass the Commons without any significant amendments being passed at all. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Anushka Asthana explain more here in their story. One factor is that Tory MPs who had been threatening to cause trouble seem to be satisfied, now that the government has agreed to publish a white paper on its Brexit plans. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has raised concerns about Brexit before (she was strongly pro-remain), but she told the Today programme this morning she was not planning to back any amendments to the bill. She told the programme: My instinct is no at the moment, not to support any amendments. Morgan was on the programme with Owen Smith, the Labour MP who challenged Jeremy Corbyn unsuccessfully for the leadership last summer. He said he thought the article 50 bill vote would be the most important he would ever cast and he said that he would be voting against, defying the Labour whip for the first time in his career. Asked why, he explained: I don’t think democracy started or ended on June 23 and, in my view, the decisions to leave the European Union is going to leave the constituents I represent worse off. And it is also playing into a politics that is meaner, meaner spirited, than we’ve had in our country traditionally, and I think it is time for the Labour party to stand up for people and to stand up for what we believe is genuinely in their interests. He also accused the government of lying about Brexit. And I fear that we are still being lied to, lied to during the referendum campaign and lied to still about how easy this is going to be or about the benefits that we will see on the other side of Brexit. When he was asked if he was really accusing Theresa May of lying, he explained: I think she’s dissembling when she says thinks like ‘I’m going to make Britain a global trading nation’. I’m sitting here in the middle of London, the most cosmopolitan, global city in the world. We are the sixth largest economy in the world. We are one of the great trading nations and have been for centuries. The notion the European Union has held us back in that regard and that we are going to suddenly overcome our long-term productivity problems by leaving and becoming even more global is, frankly, for the birds. The debate starts at about 12.40pm and we will be covering it in detail until it ends at 12pm tonight. MPs do not actually vote tomorrow, but the opening speeches may reveal more details about the government and the opposition’s approach to Brexit and, given all that is at stake, the debate itself is set to be a momentous parliamentary occasion. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 9.45am: Nick Gibb, the education minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. Around 12.40pm: MPs begin debating the second reading of the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill. The debate will go on until midnight and then carry on tomorrow, with MPs voting at 7pm on Wednesday. This morning I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, but later I will be focusing mostly or entirely on the article 50 debate.

RWE disposed of its £350m stake in the Horizon nuclear power venture in the UK last year and is searching for a buyer for its DEA oil exploration arm, operator of 13 producing gas fields in the North Sea. The power group needs to raise and save cash due to a decision by the German government to boost renewable power and phase out nuclear plants, but it is also reacting to growing political risk in Britain. The Essen-based company declined to comment on further cutbacks but an industry expert with close links to RWE npower said the utility would make further cuts in the face of \"huge uncertainty in Germany and Britain\" that made raising money very difficult for energy projects. The expert, who asked not to be named, said the combination of coalition government dithering over the Energy Market Reform bill compounded by Ed Miliband's retail price freeze had unnerved RWE at a time when it wanted to cut 6,750 jobs worldwide by 2016 and was struggling with £30bn worth of debt. Npower, which has just raised its gas and electricity prices by 10.4% and come under fire for poor service plus low tax payments, on Wednesday agreed to sell two gas and electricity subsidiaries to Telecom Plus, a smaller supplier of energy and telephone services that trades as Utility Warehouse. Npower – named this week as the energy firm with the highest number of consumer complaints and currently beset by central computer failures – promised that customers would see no negative change in their service or contracts. Last month npower was among the energy companies hauled before the energy select committee, to face MPs' accusations that they offered a confusing array of tariffs that allowed them to make \"unfair profits\". The showdown reflected growing concern that the energy market is not working properly, in the wake of Labour leader Miliband's call for a price freeze. Paul Massara, the chief executive of npower, said the sale would be good for competition. \"In one move we have helped to create the biggest independent competitor in Britain's household energy supply market. This is good for competition and good for consumer choice. Today's announcement shows that Britain is well on the way to having a big seven rather than a big six.\" He added: \"This shows that there is a willingness to compete in Britain's energy market, and that the market is anything but broken.\" Adam Scorer, director of customer watchdog, Consumer Futures, agreed with Massara that further competition could only be helpful. \"We're pleased that Telecom Plus has reached an agreement with Npower that will enable it to continue competing in the energy supply market. Their brand Utility Warehouse is the biggest multi-utility provider in the market and it is welcome they can continue to provide much needed competition for the big six,\" he said. The 500,000 customers already have (around 770,000) accounts with Utility Warehouse, which supplies them with a combined package of gas, electricity, landline and broadband services. Until now, npower has been responsible for supplying the energy part of the bundle on a wholesale basis under a deal it struck with Telecom Plus/Utility Warehouse in 2006. The decision to sell these accounts followed an Ofgem market review where the regulator called for a clearer, simpler energy market. An npower spokesman described the sale as \"a useful deal\" that clarified formal responsibility for these customers. Npower will retain a significant interest and will continue to supply electricity and gas to the subsidiaries being sold for the next 20 years. Charles Wigoder, chairman of Telecom Plus, said it was \"a transformational deal for the company, delivering significant earnings enhancement\". The company, whose sales practices have been heavily criticised in the past, aims to get 1m households to sign up to their utility bundle of energy and telecoms services in the coming years. Npower said it expected to complete the deal in late December or early January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"local-government-network/2013/feb/22/energy-lives-council-action","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-22T09:47:54Z","webTitle":"Energy: another area of our lives that depends on council action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/feb/22/energy-lives-council-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/local-government-network/2013/feb/22/energy-lives-council-action","fields":{"headline":"Energy: another area of our lives that depends on council action","bodyText":"As the energy regulator Ofgem warns that the UK is going to be increasingly dependent on expensive imports of gas to keep its lights on, what is local government's role in managing and meeting our energy needs? Local government's involvement in the energy industry, is huge. From facilitating the building of power stations and authorising the storage of nuclear waste to promoting energy efficiency in factories and homes, councils participate in almost every step along the supply chain. Ever since the 1950s, when the local planning committee took just 45 minutes to approve the building of Dounreay, the first nuclear power station primarily used for civilian power, councils have been closely involved in the development of the nuclear industry. The prospect of business rates from a new nuclear power station being built at Hinckley Point is about the only good financial news in prospect for imploding West Somerset district council. The political difficulties of nuclear power have again been exposed in recent weeks in the dispute between Copeland district council and Cumbria county council over whether to build a £12bn waste repository near Sellafield. The district wanted to go ahead, but the county blocked the scheme over geological concerns and the realisation that even the exploratory phase would have inflicted significant damage on particularly beautiful parts of the Lake District national park. There is now no part of the country where constructing this vast waste facility has local government support, a major obstacle to the government's ambitions to expand its nuclear power programme. Hardly less controversial is where to site wind farms, with increasing opposition to building turbines in attractive countryside. Lincolnshire county council has been prominent in resisting the spread of the farms, introducing new planning guidelines that stress the importance of protecting both historic sites and the natural environment. It wants farms judged on their \"cumulative visual impact\" and believes turbines should not be built within 1.4 miles (2km) of a village; in some circumstances this stretches to just over six miles. Wiltshire county council has supported comparable restrictions. With both counties being Conservative controlled, their new policies have the whiff of local skirmishes in the argument between the coalition parties on the future of renewable energy. According to Business Green at least eight councils are now pursuing buffer zones, while Conservatives in Scotland are pushing for a moratorium on wind farm construction. All this, coupled with national disputes over the appropriate level of subsidy for renewable energy sources, is creating uncertainty among developers and may well discourage investment. Arguments similar to the dispute between RWE npower renewables and Milton Keynes council over changes to its planning rules – driven in part by councillors' concerns over the increasing height of turbines – are likely to become more common. Finally, local government has a role in energy conservation, both in private homes and businesses and in its own housing and buildings. The Climate Change Act 2008 set legal targets for improving the energy efficiency of housing, and by March each council has set out its conservation measures for significantly improving the energy efficiency of local homes. All new homes are to be built to a zero carbon standard from 2016. For many councils, energy efficiency is central to tackling the growing problem of fuel poverty. The government has promised to run its Green Deal programme, which enables people to get energy efficient improvements to their homes with little or no upfront cost, in a way that supports local authority's own efficiency drives. Among these is Wychavon district council's Intelligently Green plan to cut energy consumption per head of population by 10% between 2009 and 2020, and Kirklees' Environment Vision to reducing CO2 emissions by 30% between 2005 and 2025. Energy is yet another example of a part of our lives which few perceive as being a local authority responsibility, yet which depends in a myriad of ways on council action. As the government searches for a way through what may be decades of energy shortage, local government's ability to change behaviour and consumption needs to be central to its deliberations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jan/31/francois-hollande-david-cameron-eu-french-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-31T18:18:00Z","webTitle":"EU referendum bill killed off by Labour and Lib Dems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/31/francois-hollande-david-cameron-eu-french-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jan/31/francois-hollande-david-cameron-eu-french-referendum","fields":{"headline":"EU referendum bill killed off by Labour and Lib Dems","bodyText":"David Cameron's EU reform plans have been thrown into disarray after a bill to authorise a referendum on Britain's membership by 2017 was killed off in the House of Lords by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers. Hours after François Hollande threw a hand grenade into the prime minister's EU plans, by warning that EU treaty change was not a priority, peers voted to end the committee stage of the bill, meaning it ran out of time. The Conservative party accused Labour and the Lib Dems of acting as \"enemies of democracy\". Conservative campaign headquarters tweeted: \"Utter disgrace. Labour and Lib Dems have blocked our EU Referendum Bill … they're determined to stop you have a say. Enemies of democracy.\" The killing of the bill by procedural means was not unexpected and allowed the prime minister to say that the only way to hold a referendum was to vote Conservative. Cameron tweeted: \"As Labour and the Lib Dems have killed the Wharton Bill, the one way to guarantee a referendum is to vote Conservative at the Gen Election.\" But the death of the bill, introduced by the Tory backbencher James Wharton with the support of No 10, hours after the intervention of Hollande shows the immense challenge Cameron faces to deliver a referendum by 2017. Hollande warned that major changes to the rules of the EU would trigger a referendum in France. As Cameron insisted at their bilateral summit that he would hold a referendum in Britain on renewed EU membership terms by 2017, the French president said that one country could not dictate the pace of change to others. Cameron and Hollande clashed over the EU during a joint press conference at RAF Brize Norton at the end of one of the frostiest UK-France summits in years. Downing Street was angry when the Élysée Palace briefed the entire contents of the summit – covering defence, space and nuclear power co-operation – to journalists in Paris on Wednesday. Likewise, the Élysée was annoyed when Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, said recently that Hollande's economic policies were driving the French economy into the sand. The preparations were not helped when Cameron suggested the summit should take place at Blenheim Palace. It was pointed out that this was named after the Battle of Blenheim, the Duke of Marlborough's victory over France in 1704. No 10 eventually settled on RAF Brize Norton in Cameron's Witney constituency to symbolise Anglo-French military co-operation. The prime minister tried to create a relaxed mood by taking Hollande to lunch at the Swan Inn in Swinbrook, the pub used for the scene of the elopement by Lady Sybil and the chauffeur Branson in Downton Abbey. The president's own love life was raised by the Daily Telegraph's Christopher Hope, who asked him the sort of direct question avoided by French journalists. Hope asked: \"Monsieur le president, I know this is a very sensitive subject for you. Do you think your private life has made France an international joke? Are you still having an affair with Julie Gayet and do you wish she was here?\" Hollande replied: \"With regard to your last question I decline to answer.\" The president focused most of his remarks on the economy and on making clear French unease about Cameron's plans to use an EU treaty renegotiation – expected by Downing Street when the eurozone agrees new governance arrangements – to change the terms of Britain's membership. Hollande reminded the prime minister that a referendum was (successfully) held in 1992 on the Maastricht treaty and (unsuccessfully) on the EU constitution in 2005. \"France would like the eurozone to be better co-ordinated, better integrated,\" he said. \"If there are going to be amendments to the text [of the treaty] we don't feel that for the time being they are urgent. We feel that revising the treaty is not a priority for the time being.\" Hollande said the UK was free to organise a referendum, \"to know what their place is going to be in Europe. I perfectly respect their choice. In Europe there is a discussion under way on our own fate, how we should get organised … A change in the treaty would also involve procedures. Minor changes for instance – there we could have a parliamentary vote. \"But when you are dealing with major changes – you will remember for the single currency with the Maastricht treaty [and] we had the European constitutional treaty in 2005 – we had to have a referendum. So everybody has to assess what procedures exist. We can't just expect to follow the example of one country in Europe in order to determine the rest.\" Cameron said he was determined to hold a referendum by 2017 to approve a reform plan that he would table during treaty negotiations. \"Clearly there will be further treaty changes coming, not least because of what is happening in the eurozone. The eurozone is examining all sorts of further steps that need to be taken in terms of co-ordination, some of which I believe will require a treaty change. \"What people really need to know in the UK is that the in-out referendum that I will hold if I am prime minister will happen by the end of 2017. There can be absolutely no doubt about that. Irrespective of whether this private member's bill succeeds or fails makes no difference to the pledge I am making about this in-out referendum.\" Downing Street believes Paris is moving its position after saying last year that it did not expect a treaty change. Officials believe the Élysée is now acknowledging that this will happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2013/nov/17/doris-lessing-dies-94","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-17T13:57:15Z","webTitle":"Doris Lessing dies aged 94","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/17/doris-lessing-dies-94","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2013/nov/17/doris-lessing-dies-94","fields":{"headline":"Doris Lessing dies aged 94","bodyText":"The literary world mourned on hearing that Doris Lessing, the Nobel-prize winning author of The Golden Notebook and The Grass is Singing, among more than 50 novels covering subjects from politics to science fiction, had died peacefully at her London home aged 94. Her younger son, Peter, whom she cared for through years of illness, died three weeks ago. The biographer Michael Holroyd, her friend and executor, said her contribution to literature was \"outstandingly rich and innovative\". He called her themes \"universal and international … They ranged from the problems of post-colonial Africa to the politics of nuclear power, the emergence of a new woman's voice and the spiritual dimensions of 20th-century civilisation. Few writers have as broad a range of subject and sympathy. \"She is one of those rare writers whose work crosses frontiers, and her impressively large output constitutes a chronicle of our time. She has enlarged the territory both of the novel and of our consciousness.\" The American author Joyce Carol Oates said: \"It might be said of Doris Lessing, as Walt Whitman boasted of himself: I am vast, I contain multitudes. For many, Lessing was a revolutionary feminist voice in 20th-century literature – though she resisted such categorisation, quite vehemently. For many others, Lessing was a 'space fiction' prophet, using the devices and idioms of the fantastic to address human issues of evolution and the environment. \"And for other readers, Lessing was a writer willing to explore 'interior worlds', the mysterious life of the spiritual self. Though it is perhaps a predictable choice, my favourite of her many novels is The Golden Notebook. And my favourite of her many wonderful stories is her most famous – To Room Nineteen.\" Nick Pearson, her editor at HarperCollins/4th Estate, said: \"I adored her.\" Born in Iran, brought up in the African bush in Zimbabwe – where her 1950 first novel, The Grass is Singing, was set – Lessing had lived in London for more than 50 years. In 2007 she came back to West Hampstead, north London, carrying heavy bags of shopping, to find her doorstep besieged by reporters and camera crews. \"Oh, Christ,\" she said, on learning that at 88 she had just become the oldest author and the 11th woman to win the Nobel prize in literature. Pausing rather crossly on her front path, she said: \"One can get more excited\", and went on to observe that since she had already won all the other prizes in Europe, this was \"a royal flush\". Later she remarked: \"I'm 88 years old and they can't give the Nobel to someone who's dead, so I think they were probably thinking they'd probably better give it to me now before I've popped off.\" The citation from the Swedish Academy called her \"that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\". Pearson, her editor at the time, recalled the doorstep moment vividly: \"That was what she was like. That was vintage Doris. \"When I took over looking after her books, she had a fairly formidable reputation, and the first time I went to meet her I was terrified, but she was always completely charming to me. She was always more interested in talking about the other writers on our list, what the young writers were working on – and reading – than in talking about her own books.\" Lessing's last novel, although several earlier books have since been re-released as e-books, was Albert and Emily, published in 2008. Pearson said: \"That was a very interesting book for her, revisiting the early life of her mother and her father and how they had been touched by the first world war. \"At the time she said to me 'this is my last book', and we accepted that. She was already at a great age, and I could see she was tired.\" The publisher's UK chief executive, Charlie Redmayne, added: \"Doris Lessing was one of the great writers of our age. She was a compelling storyteller with a fierce intellect and a warm heart who was not afraid to fight for what she believed in. It was an honour for HarperCollins to publish her.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2013/jan/20/japan-new-prime-minister-rising-hopes-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-20T00:01:11Z","webTitle":"Japan's new PM brings rising hopes that economy can be revived","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/20/japan-new-prime-minister-rising-hopes-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jan/20/japan-new-prime-minister-rising-hopes-economy","fields":{"headline":"Japan's new PM brings rising hopes that economy can be revived","bodyText":"In his first major speech of the year, Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called for a \"rocket-like start towards economic recovery\". Next month sees the start of the year of the snake, which is, he said \"a symbol of business prosperity\". The stock and currency markets responded better than perhaps even Abe could have hoped. The Nikkei average has risen dramatically, while the yen is finally ceding ground to the US dollar, bringing relief to Japan's embattled exporters. On Friday, the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen for two-and-a-half years. Voters in last month's general election were receptive to Abe's focus on growth in the world's third-largest economy, even if it meant setting aside measures to tackle public debt, now more than 230% of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. While \"Abenomics\" marks a departure from the previous government's priorities of debt reduction and tax increases to fund welfare spending, Abe's approach has a familiar ring. It marks a return to old-style spending on public works, a time-honoured Liberal Democratic party [LDP] policy pilloried in the past for funding the construction of cavernous community centres in rural villages and infamous \"roads to nowhere\". Abe has promised to put an end to such waste, and instead wants to focus investment on three things: the region ravaged by the March 2011 tsunami; making repairs to ageing infrastructure, highlighted by last month's fatal tunnel collapse near Tokyo; and quake-proofing schools and hospitals. This month, his cabinet agreed on a stimulus package that includes ¥10.3 trillion (£70bn) in central government funds. The aim is to add about 2 percentage points to the country's real growth rate, and create more than 600,000 jobs. Business leaders welcomed the stimulus package. \"It was well-timed, as wide-ranging measures were taken with a sense of speed,\" said Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japanese Business Federation. Abe has made it clear that he expects government action to be complemented by a more aggressive monetary policy on the part of the Bank of Japan, including raising the country's inflation target to 2% from 1%. The government and the central bank are expected to issue a joint statement early this week that will largely incorporate Abe's demands. He will use his power of appointment to ensure that the next Bank of Japan chief, who replaces the current governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, in April, shares his views on easing. \"We will choose someone who appreciates my basic policies to beat deflation,\" he said. There is a real prospect that the stimulus package announced last week – the biggest Japan has approved since the Lehman Brothers shock – will have an immediate impact. That could earn the LDP enough support to secure victory in key upper-house elections due in July, according to Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"It's striking how focused they have been on the economy – they've been remarkably on-message and promised not to be diverted by other issues,\" he says. \"But it could turn out to be the same old story, with money going to familiar vested interests, particularly in the countryside. It's important to keep an eye on where the cash goes.\" Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, believes Abe's plan to pull Japan out of two decades of stagnation and deflation \"could work up to a point\". \"What's missing in his proposals are microeconomic reforms: to deal with structural problems that would make it easier for women to contribute to the economy and for families to have children,\" he says. \"Abe comes from a wing of the LDP that really hasn't paid any attention to these issues. On top of that, his social conservatism is obvious: he has little interest in modernising policies towards women and families.\" Polls show that consumers are sceptical about Abe's ability to turn the economy around. A weaker yen will help exporters, but the price of imports on which Japan is heavily reliant, especially in food and energy, will hit households if incomes fail to keep up with inflation. While doubts remain over job security and wages continue to stagnate – they have failed to rise for nine of the past 12 months – consumers are unlikely to embark on a spending spree. \"It will take a lot to unleash consumers,\" Dujarric says. \"After 20 or more years of stagnation or low growth, it will take a lot to convince them that things have changed.\" Koichi Hamada, Abe's special economics adviser, concedes the government and central bank are about to perform a tricky balancing act. \"Economics is like medicine,\" he says. \"We don't know how much medicine is needed to cure a high fever, so you have to try, and then observe. But you have to do as much as you can to beat deflation.\" Even before taking office in December, Abe put pressure on the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target, warning that it could expect a political battle of wills unless it signed up to his vision of monetary easing. Other advanced economies will be closely following the Abe administration's fortunes. Like Japan, they are struggling with mounting public debt, and face rising welfare costs because of their ageing populations. In many ways, Japan is a test case for the rest of the developed world. In this, the year of the snake, Japan can only hope that it quickly sheds the skin of recession and stagnation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/24/wind-turbine-lydd-runway","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-24T00:06:15Z","webTitle":"Wind turbines, a new airport and an atomic plant threaten historic wetlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/24/wind-turbine-lydd-runway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/24/wind-turbine-lydd-runway","fields":{"headline":"Wind turbines, a new airport and an atomic plant threaten historic wetlands","bodyText":"In the picturesque town of Lydd, the museum records the fate of two smugglers arrested at the turn of the 17th century. The men were locked in a room at a inn on the edge of Romney Marsh, a few miles from the English Channel, where they were guarded by six armed customs officers. But the officers were unprepared for the militancy of local residents. Hours after the arrests, more than 100 from the surrounding marshes confronted the guards, freeing the men. More than a century later, residents confirmed their antipathy to authority when they cheered a smugglers' convoy of contrabrand through the streets of the town. Today, politicians have replaced the detested customs officers as the bête noire of residents. They fear Westminster politicians and local councillors are set to approve plans that would lead to the skies above swarming with commercial aircraft, while unsightly wind turbines proliferate on their fields. A decision on whether to develop a major airport in Lydd, less than three miles from the Dungeness nuclear power station, is said to be imminent, while residents are battling to prevent more wind farms being built near the marsh. But this is more than a dispute between the inhabitants of a remote, wild and beautiful region, and the metropolis. The battle over the future of Romney Marsh offers a snapshot of the dilemmas facing a government struggling to reconcile job-friendly \"grand projects\" with commitments to reduce carbon emissions and preserve the integrity of the countryside. These have become perennial themes in austerity Britain; all are present in this exposed corner of England. If Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for communities and local government, approves the airport plan, opponents claim that the decision will speak volumes about both the government's attitude to nuclear safety after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, and its attitude to international environmental obligations. It would also undermine the point of the Davies commission, which was set up by the government to consider the arguments for airport expansion, and will not publish its findings until 2015. Currently Lydd receives the occasional light aircraft. But approval for a runway extension would allow large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, which can weigh over 70 tonnes fully loaded. The operators of Dungeness B, the French energy giant EDF, opposed the application, warning that it would increase the risk of a nuclear accident. \"The large increase in air traffic around the site is a risk that should be sensibly avoided in the local and wider public interest,\" EDF argued in its submission. If Pickles approves the extension, a crucial step in allowing the airport to take up to two million passengers, opponents say that no other regional runway in Europe, possibly the world, would be as close to a nuclear power complex. The airport, which is owned by the Saudi billionaire, Sheikh Fahad al Athel, is surrounded by protected habitats including a major RSPB bird reserve. Environmentalists say that it is under one of the main migratory bird routes in the south of England. As a result, the Dungeness Peninsula is the most heavily protected area in the UK, its habitats designated under EU and UK legislation. But some in government appear willing to flout such laws. George Osborne has said that he wants to \"make sure that gold plating of European Union rules on things like habitats are not placing ridiculous rules on British business\". The proximity of large colonies of birds to a large airport and a nuclear power station has also prompted fears of a catastrophic birdstrike. The Office for Nuclear Regulation acknowledges that if a large aircraft were to crash onto the site it would have the potential to cause its most severe \"Target 9\" incident, one that would kill more than 100 people. But it concludes that the probability of an accident at Dungeness, resulting from the introduction of commercial flights at Lydd, is so low that it can be ignored. Experts hired by Lydd Airport Action Group (LAAG), which opposes the scheme, disagree, claiming that the risk assessment is flawed. The group complains that repeated requests, made under the Freedom of Information Act, to establish how the ONR reached its decision not to oppose the expansion, have been denied. The European Commission has joined the dispute, asking the government for answers, a move that could lead to the application being mired in legal battles. \"Should the government approve Lydd airport's development, not only would this leave it open to legal challenge because of infringement of multiple directives but it would demonstrate that the government is willing to sacrifice public safety and the environment for its growth agenda,\" said Louise Barton of LAAG. The RSPB is equally opposed. \"We already know that the only real capacity issue is at Heathrow,\" said Chris Corrigan, its regional director in the south-east. \"If there is a decision to allow expansion at Lydd, it is both unnecessary and extremely damaging, especially in the context of the UK's legally binding climate change targets and the risk of not meeting them due to spiralling aviation emissions.\" One way of countering the increase in emissions generated by airport expansion would be further investment in green energy. But opposition to onshore wind farms in the region also runs deep. A few miles from Lydd, the energy company Ecotricity is looking to build six 125-metre turbines near the village of Snave. \"Snave has been identified as an excellent site for wind energy with enough resource to provide clean green electricity to power the equivalent of 9,800 homes a year,\" it says. The scheme is one of many small-scale onshore wind farms being proposed to help Britain meet EU targets for 15% of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Save Our Marsh, Block Rural Exploitation, or \"Sombe\", a local pressure group, says that the marshes already have one of England's largest onshore windfarms, a 26-turbine scheme at Little Cheyne Court, close to the medieval Cinque Port of Rye. Several other marsh parishes are also being considered for onshore turbines, with plans for four new developments unveiled in the last year alone. As a result, Sombre fears that a plethora of small onshore farms could become one giant network of turbines over time. \"Once so many have been placed strategically around Romney Marsh they will go for the infill,\" said Mike Bartlett, a spokesman for the group. \"We are fighting against it because we fear it will set a precedent.\" Last Thursday evening, about 100 people packed the parish hall to discuss their opposition to the scheme. The mood was angry with many warning that the haunting bleak beauty of the marshes was in jeopardy. The local Tory MP, Damien Collins, backs Sombre's campaign, saying the answer to Britain's energy crisis is to build a new nuclear power station at Dungeness. However he is in favour of expanding the airport, saying it would put \"Romney Marsh on the runway to economic growth\", an argument shared by some locals who fear the marshes will die unless the young can be dissuaded from moving away in search of jobs. Airport expansion, nuclear power, wind farms and conservation: a row that has it all. And what transpires in this remote part of Kent will not stay in Kent. Reflected in the brackish water of its marshes, the shape of Britain's future can be discerned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/aug/01/neogreens-science-business-save-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-01T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"The new environmentalism: where men must act 'as gods' to save the planet | Paul Kingsnorth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/neogreens-science-business-save-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/neogreens-science-business-save-planet","fields":{"headline":"The new environmentalism: where men must act 'as gods' to save the planet","bodyText":"A society that takes progress as its religion does not look kindly on despair. If you are expected to believe everything will keep getting better, it can be difficult to admit to believing otherwise. This is doubly true for political activists. If you've devoted your life to fighting for a cause, you will probably feel duty bound to continue supporting it, at least in public, however hopeless it may begin to look. Hope is certainly in short supply in environmental circles these days. With the failure of yet another global summit to \"protect the planet\" – this time the Rio+20 Earth summit – a tipping point seems to have been reached. Green activism has achieved a lot in five decades, but it has been unable to prevent the global industrial machine from continuing to destroy wild nature and replace it with human culture. There is no prospect of this changing in the near future, and we are reaching the point now when many prominent greens, having denied this reality for so long, are beginning to admit this in public. So: what next? One increasingly fashionable answer is offered by a coalescing group which we might call \"neo-environmentalists\". The resemblance between this group and the neoliberals of the early 70s is intriguing. Like the neoliberals, the neo-environmentalists are attempting to break through the lines of an old orthodoxy which is visibly exhausted and confused. Like the neoliberals, they speak the language of money and power. Like the neoliberals, they cluster around a few key thinktanks: then, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Cato Institute and the Adam Smith Institute; now, the Breakthrough Institute, the Long Now Foundation and the Copenhagen Consensus. Like the neoliberals, they think they have radical solutions. Neo-environmentalism is a progressive, business-friendly, postmodern take on the environmental dilemma. It dismisses traditional green thinking, with its emphasis on limits and transforming societal values, as naive. New technologies, global capitalism and western-style development are not the problem but the solution. The future lies in enthusiastically embracing biotechnology, synthetic biology, nuclear power, nanotechnology, geo-engineering and anything else new and complex that annoys Greenpeace. According to the neogreens, growth has no limits. We are, in the words of their spiritual leader, Stewart Brand, \"as gods\", and must accept our responsibility to manage the planet rationally through powerful technologies guided by science. Wilderness does not exist, \"nature\" is a human construct, and everything that matters can be measured by science and priced by markets.. Only \"romantics\" think otherwise. Neo-environmentalism is beginning to make waves in certain circles. Brand gives talks all over the world arguing the case for megacities and GM crops; British writer Mark Lynas gets airtime to promote nuclear power and attack his former green friends as \"Luddites\"; US writer Emma Marris argues in her book Rambunctious Garden that there is no real wilderness left to protect; scientist Peter Kareiva, who works for the world's biggest conservation group, the Nature Conservancy, argues that conservation should aim to protect wild nature not for its own sake, but if and because it benefits humans. The Earth, say the neogreens, belongs to homo sapiens now. The value of nature is measured by what we can do with it. Some of this may shock old guard greens – which is the point – but it is not a new message. It is simply the latest variant on the old Wellsian techno-optimism which has been promising us paradise for over a century. The neo-environmentalists are growing in numbers at present not because their ideas are new, but because they offer a business-friendly worldview which, unlike the tiresome old green message, is designed to make people feel comfortable about their plane flights and their iPads. Science and business will provide. Nature will adapt. Optimism is permitted again. Indeed, it is almost mandatory. But maybe the green movement was asking for it. For some time, mainstream environmentalism has demonstrated a single-minded obsession with climate change and technological solutions to it, to the exclusion of other concerns. Its language and its focus have grown increasingly technocratic and scientistic. I would guess that most people have a love of nature in some form; but few of them love arguing about whether nuclear power is better than gas. Any campaign to protect the wild world which avoids acknowledging our intuitive, emotional relationship with it will leave itself open to the kind of heartless ideological assault it is now receiving from the neogreens. Global campaigning for an abstract \"environment\" does not appear to work. What does work is engaging with nature on a human scale. Perhaps the best rejoinder to those who believe the world is a giant spreadsheet is an engagement with its messy, everyday complexity. A kind of vernacular environmentalism; an engagement not with \"the environment\", but with environments as we experience them in lived reality. Perhaps it's time to go back to basics. So we might learn what grows wild in our local area and whether we can eat it. We might build up a bank of practical skills, from horticulture to land management. We might go out at night and plant seeds in vacant flowerbeds near where we live. We might work on small-scale engineering projects, from water purification technologies to micro-solar panels. We might work to save bees or butterflies or water meadows or woodlands or playing fields that we know and have a relationship with. We might walk in the hills, or on the canal bank, or in the local waste ground; get to know our place and how it works. I can hear the rejoinder already: \"None of this is going to save the world!\" It's true. But we've had four decades of trying to \"save the world\", and we have failed utterly. This would be a good time to step back, to get our hands dirty and our feet wet, to smell the rain when it comes and get a feel for where we are on this Earth and what, at the root of it all, we can still usefully do. \"All great civilisations,\" wrote the Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh, \"are built on parochialism.\" If the alternative is trying to act like gods, then I'm with the poets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/15/energy-companies-abandonment-nuclear-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-15T15:49:30Z","webTitle":"Energy companies blame abandonment of nuclear plans on lack of cash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/energy-companies-abandonment-nuclear-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/15/energy-companies-abandonment-nuclear-plans","fields":{"headline":"Energy companies blame abandonment of nuclear plans on lack of cash","bodyText":"Investing billions in new nuclear power stations would have forced a credit-rating downgrade on energy giant RWE, the company's chief executive has revealed. The head of another big six energy company, E.ON, blamed the abandonment of its nuclear plans on a lack of \"financial firepower\". Tuesday's developments are the latest to demonstrate that the huge cost and decades-long payback times of new nuclear power stations are making them difficult to fund in the current economic crisis. RWE and E.ON cancelled their joint plan to build new reactors in March, while nuclear giant EDF has delayed work at its site at Hinkley and EDF's nuclear partner Centrica says the case for nuclear investment is \"unproven\". Volker Beckers, CEO at RWE npower, was questioned on the company's decision by MPs on the Commons select committee for energy and climate change. Persisting with the Horizon joint venture with E.ON was not an option, he said, adding: \"It would have meant a downgrading, and we could not afford to do that.\" The company had already suffered one downgrade and was reducing its capital requirements in response. \"Our decision was down to the financial firepower of the company,\" said Tony Cocker, CEO of E.ON UK. \"Nuclear is an extremely long-term investment.\" Both RWE and E.ON are German-owned and were damaged by the decision of the German government to desert nuclear power, as well as lower recent profit margins in gas- and coal-powered electricity generation. The companies are seeking to sell the Horizon project, which had aimed to invest about £20bn in nuclear reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, north Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Despite E.ON's pull-out, Cocker told MPs the UK had the best policy environment for investment in new nuclear power in Europe: \"But investors will need greater patience than us.\" Energy minister Charles Hendry was also questioned by MPs on the faltering of the government's plan to have eight new nuclear power stations built within the next decade. \"I remain very positive,\" he said. Ministers are currently negotiating with companies over how much energy customers will be charged to pay for investment in new, low-carbon generation, including nuclear and wind power. \"We will not sign up for anything we think is bad for bill payers. We believe nuclear should be the lowest-cost, large-scale energy source, and the price will reflect that.\" Hendry told MPs that at least £100bn was needed to build replacements for the many old coal, gas and nuclear plants that will close in the next few years. He said the government's forthcoming energy bill aimed to ensure energy security, while meeting greenhouse gas emissions and getting the best deal for the consumer. Being exposed to events in other countries, such as the nuclear disaster at Fukushima and the election of nuclear-power-sceptic François Hollande in France, was \"inevitable\", said Hendry. \"If we want to see nuclear power as part of the energy mix, that's a challenge we have to take on.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-and-nick-clegg-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T17:51:49Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg on the Andrew Marr show: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-and-nick-clegg-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dem-conference-and-nick-clegg-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg on the Andrew Marr show: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Lib Dem delegates have rejected a proposal to use filters to force people who want to watch online pornography to have to opt in. Proposing the motion, Floella Benjamin said it was “about protecting children from online pornography and inappropriate material - it's not about censorship or stopping adults from accessing legal material”. She went on. Arguments about opt in, censorship or freedom of expression are simply not applicable here. This pandemic crosses a sacred line - although the internet is a wonderful resource, it also has a dark side. But the proposals was shelved after they attracted strong, and passionately expressed, opposition from delegates. • The Lib Dems have proposed a review of university tuition fees after the next election. Adopting a review as party policy effectively represents a compromise between those in favour of the current system, and those who are opposed. Vince Cable, the business secretary who allowed tuition fees to rise to £9,000, said that he was glad that the “rancour” had now gone out of this issue within the party and that, even if a party did promise to scrap tuition fees, the public would not believe that this was viable. • Environment groups have criticised the Lib Dems for endorsing nuclear power. Friends of the Earth said: “Backing for nuclear power punches a huge hole in the Liberal Democrats' fast-sinking green credibility.” • Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, has said that Scots are being held to ransom by nationalists who won't bring about positive change until they get independence. As the Press Association reports, Rennie said the SNP's \"perverse logic\" meant that toddlers were being deprived of free nursery care and students denied a place at college. I have been saying for a long time that the SNP have the wrong priorities for Scotland. They have sacrificed health, transport, education and justice to campaign for independence. It might be right for the SNP but it's wrong for Scotland. The lack of action from the SNP isn't an accident. It's being done on purpose. The SNP have said they will bring in childcare for two-year-olds if they get independence. But only if they get independence. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's an extract from Jess Palmer's speech. Conference, five years ago this motion would have ruined my life. When I was 10, I discovered fanfic. If you don't know, fanfic is online fiction written by fans, using characters from films, books and suchlike. It is often, but not always, adult in nature. In one of these fanfics there was a throwaway line about a gay character. My reaction was to physically cover the screen with my hands and look around to see if my parents could see. That day I figured out, on our giant, ageing Windows 98 desktop how to delete my internet history - just in case. When I was 14, an old hat at computers by now, a pro at deleting my history and finding proxy sites to cover my tracks, I started writing it myself. I unknowingly poured a lot of myself into those stories, waxing lyrical about characters who were figuring themselves out, what they liked and what the world thought of them. And these stories went online, sharing space with pieces that had more adult themes. And when I was 17 - and, come one, you're suppose to have figured yourself by the time you are 17 - I ended up doing it all again, finding a whole community dedicated to writing about asexual characters. I had not even realised that asexuality existed before. And, yes, I do know how how weird it is to credit literary porn with discovering the oh-so-radical idea that it's okay not to feel the need to have sex. But no one told me. The thing is, with a background like mine, small, isolated city, vaguely rural, military family, I wasn't going to learn it anywhere else. More to the point, the idea of not being straight was not something I could even consider. So I did not have the luxury of accessing any teenage self-help sites, which would probably be filtered out anyway under this motion ... I found out everything I know about sexuality via fan fiction - something this motion would filter and block. I had no other choice. At the end of her speech Palmer said she was now 20. Delegates have voted overwhelmingly for a \"reference back\" for the online pornography motion. It's a polite version of a defeat, meaning that the issue has been sent back to the federal policy committee for a rethink.At the Lib Dem rally last night Nick Clegg joked that, after the Syria defeat in the House of Commons, he leant over to David Cameron and told him: \"Dont' worry, it's only a reference back.\" Often one political conference sounds much like another, but every now and then an issue crops up that illuminates something unique about the party in question. At the Conservative conference, it might be when they debate hunting. At Labour, you might get a moment like this when a miner takes the platform. And at the Lib Dems - well, you're unlikely to find a better example than the debate going on now - on child pornography. Floella Benjamin, the Lib Dem peer and former TV presenter, presented a motion proposing the promotion of opt-in filters so that family computers can only access pornography if an adult has actively chosen than option. At a Conservative or Labour conference it would probably have gone through quite happily. Claire Perry could have given the same speech. But restricting access to pornography isn't very liberal and, at the start of the debate the chair, said he had been overwhelmed by people wanting to speak against the proposals. The libertarian strand in the party is clearly still very strong. For example, James Shaddock said the motion was \"contrary to everything that we as a party believe in\". Pornography could be good for people's relationships, he said. \"Do not let us become the Puritans of the 21st century.\" Another speaker said that any attempt to stop young children seeing porn was bound to fail. And Sarah Brown, from Cambridge, said that porn filters constantly stopped people accessing LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) website. Her own website, which has been shortlisted for a Lib Dem Voice award, had been blocked because of its adult content, she said. But the best speech came from the blue-haired Jess Palmer, who described how reading \"fanfic\" (fan fiction, often erotic) online as a teenager taught her things that she would never have learnt elsewhere, including the nature of asexuality. It was a very powerful speech, honest, candid, moving, possibly the highlight of the day. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Stephen Tall at Lib Dem Voice looks at the findings of a survey of Lib Dem members showing what they expect and want to happen after 2015. 1) Lib Dems want to be in government: 75% of party members are committed to being in government. However, we don’t know yet (can’t know) if those 3-in-4 members are equally happy for the party to be in coalition irrespective of whether it’s Labour or the Conservatives who are our partners. 2) Lib Dems prefer Labour as our partners by 2:1: you can interpret this in a couple of different ways (not mutually exclusive). Perhaps Lib Dems are more comfortable with a centre-left coalition. Or perhaps Lib Dems feel the current coalition with the Conservatives has more or less run its course. Or perhaps Lib Dems want to assert our equidistance, showing to the public we’re equally comfortable working with either Tories but also Labour. 3) Coalition is preferred to confidence and supply by 5:2: I’ve made no secret that I’m no fan of ‘confidence and supply’, by which the Lib Dems would lend support to either Labour or the Tories on budget and confidence motions but otherwise vote on an issue-by-issue basis. It seems to me a way of getting all the pain of coalition with little of the gain of being in government. • James Forsyth at Coffee House says he is not is not convinced by Paddy Ashdown's claim that the Lib Dems are neutral over who they would like to work with in a hung parliament. Whatever Ashdown does, it is hard to see how he can shut this conversation down. The more a hung parliament looks likely, the more interest they’ll be in who the Lib Dems would prefer to go into government with. Another thing that’ll keep this conversation going is that there are very different views inside the party about who would be the better, post-2015 partner for the Lib Dems. • James Kirkup at the Telegraph says the Lib Dems are confused. On one hand, the Lib Dems want you to be better off each week. And on the other, they want to make life more expensive for you. \"We'll get you a pay rise and make you spend it on plastic bags\" is not, I'd suggest, the simplest, most retail-friendly message a party can send. But it is a very Lib Dem one, and in a way, that's something to celebrate: power really hasn't changed them. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has just spoken in the education debate. He said he would accept the Liberal Youth amendment saying there should be a review of tuition fees after the election. (See 3.40pm.) He said the way Steven Hayes proposed the amendment in the debate for Liberal Youth showed how the party had moved on from the \"rancour\" this issue generated a few years ago. Effectively the government had introduced a graduate tax, he said. After two years, we can see the effects,he says. The demand to go to university has not been affected. Applications and admissions from students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a record level. Some of that is because what the Lib Dems have done to promote bursaries, he said. Realistically, the Lib Dems and the other major parties are not going to go back to free tuition, he said. Even if a party promised it, I don't think the public would believe it. But, and this is where Liberal Youth are right, we have to be evidence based, we have to look at the consequences of what we have done, and if necessary change and adapt the policy. Paddy Ashdown was interviewed on the Daily Politics earlier. Here are the key quotes. • Ashdown insisted that the Lib Dems were neutral on who they would prefer to work with in a hung parliament after the next election. That was because it was a matter for the votes, he said. That any journalist who in these next two years says that any Liberal Democrat prefers anything else in terms of the outcome of a coalition but the result of the ballot box dictating that outcome, that any of them prefer one side to another and they want to see that coalition rather than a coalition determined by the electors and their votes, is going to get a bloody hard time from me and I don’t care who they are. This was why he was so angry with the Observer. (See 9.13am) He explained he was unhappy about a headline in an early edition suggesting he favoured a deal with the Tories. He said that he did not have a problem with the text of the interview. • He described the Lib Dems as a \"leftwing\" party. This is what he said when Andrew Neil put it to him that his point about the Lib Dems not favouring one party more than another was contradicted by a poll showing that Lib Dem councillors would rather work with Labour. I don’t think it’s news that as a leftwing party we find it perhaps more congenial with those on the left wing but that’s not the issue. • He said coalitions were \"here to stay\". Coalitions are here to stay, I think we’re in the era of coalition politics and I think we have a real role to play in that. In his speech to the conference Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, accused the SNP of “sacrificing” other policy areas in favour of their focus on achieving independence. As an example, he citied free childcare for two-year-olds, which is being promoted by the Lib Dems in England. The SNP have said they will bring in childcare for two-year-olds if they get independence – the first minister will only give children in Scotland what they need if he gets what he wants. People caught in the middle of this should be worried. I've taken the quote from PoliticsHome. At another fringe meeting there seems to have been a lively exchange between Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury who led a Whitehall review of alternatives to Trident, and Lady Falkner of Margravine, co-chair of the Lib Dem backbench international affairs committee. Alexander said there was no need to have a nuclear-armed submarine at sea all the time (continuous at-sea deterrence, the current policy that requires four submarines). The Lib Dem plan to scale this down was \"credible, realistic and achievable\", Alexander said. But Falkner disagreed. How does a posture of sending out boats unarmed actually deliver credibility? We say that we will send out boats with a public declaration that they will not be armed and that's what we will do and then occasionally, as the world gets tenser, as potentially a crisis situation approaches, we will send two guys up a hill to [nuclear storage facility] Coulport to get down some warheads, run down the mountain with them, stick them into batteries, get the boats out of the Clyde - never mind the fact an aggressor might target you in the Clyde - and then a couple of weeks to get out into international waters and, if you are talking about China, you've still got a long way to go. Crisis in my mind usually denotes crisis, as in Cuban missile crisis, it doesn't normally denote six months of time before you can actually do what you are planning to do. There was a good exchange on the role of nuclear weapons as an insurance. Falkner said: There's not much point in having flood insurance if it only applies in a drought.\" And Alexander replied: Yes, the deterrent is an insurance policy. I think we are paying too high a premium at the moment. What we are recommending here is a step down. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association. Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem MP and chair of all-party parliamentary cycling group, has put out a news release about the cycling motion passed earlier. It calls for a cycling budget worth at least £10 per person per year, rising to £20, and it says the government should aim to get the number of journeys made by bike up to 10% by 2025 (from 2% now - in the Netherlands it's 30%). I am delighted that the Lib Dems are the first party to formally endorse the 'Get Britain Cycling' policy from the All-Party Parliamentary Cycling Group, which I co-chair. Cycling is efficient, environmentally friendly, healthy and fun, and the Liberal Democrats will continue to champion cycling and walking,\" Huppert said. Delegates are now debating education. There is an amendment on tuition fees saying that there should be a review of the new £9,000 maximum fees structure, looking at its impact on public borrowing and widening access, \"with a view to reforming the system to address these challenges if possible or if necessary for fees to be eliminated in a feasible and cost-effective way\". Sarah Teather had been listed to appear at fringe meetings last night and at lunchtime. But she did not show up because she has not been at the conference. Here's another line from Charles Kennedy (presumably from his lunchtime fringe). The Lib Dems don't always have a great record on jokes. Sarah Teather's stand-up routine at a rally two years ago is still remembered (but not fondly). Some of the jokes in Danny Alexander's speech last year were so poor that Andrew Neil asked him live on air if Teather was his speech writer. And now Ed Davey has joined the gang. Here's one of the stories the Press Association filed about his speech. The energy secretary delivered a series of tired lines and worn gags which fell flat at the Lib Dem party conference in Glasgow. Ed Davey's line that he was \"fracking responsible\" for putting an end to the \"hyperbole\" of controversial shale gas exploration was met with groans. His send-up of his Conservative Cabinet colleagues received a somewhat warmer reception: \"Liberal Democrats, our fights to green this government haven't just faced opposition from the badgering of Owen Paterson or the pickling of Eric. No. We have had to face the ultimate test - the charm of Michael Gove. Mr Gove and his draft curriculum for geography. Strong on European continental drift. Weak on climate change.\" Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, told a fringe meeting at lunchtime that he did not expect Britain to join the euro for at least a generation. I've taken the quote from the Press Association. I don't honestly see [euro membership] happening over the course of the next generation. As I'm now just coming up to 54, that pretty much rules it out for me in terms of relevance to my political career. Kennedy also criticised Tony Blair for not taking Britain into the single currency. I think we could have won a referendum in Tony Blair's second year in office on the principle of a single currency when the circumstances were right, subject to an affirmative vote in Parliament. That's what he marched everybody up to the top of the hill about ... and then everybody got marched back down the hill again. Waiting for Godot was a two-act play in which nothing happened twice. Blair's European policy was a two-act play in which nothing happened twice, and that's why I'm very critical of him on that issue. Here is some reaction to the Lib Dem vote on nuclear power. As you can see, environmental groups are deeply unhappy about it. From Doug Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist This motion shows how far the Liberal Democrats have slid from their previously principled position on energy and climate. The party now seems prepared to thrust the issues of nuclear waste and funding on to future generations, rather than take on vested interests and put us on the road to dealing with the climate crisis in a clean, safe way. From Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth's policy and campaigns director Backing for nuclear power punches a huge hole in the Liberal Democrats fast-sinking green credibility. Nuclear power comes with massive costs attached. Ed Davey is deluded if he thinks new reactors can go ahead without public subsidy - building them will result in the Liberal Democrats, yet again, breaking their promises. Championing a plastic bag charge is a drop in the ocean. With its support for new reactors and gas-fired power stations and refusal to back power sector decarbonisation the Liberal Democrats are fast becoming Tory-lite when it comes to the environment. From the SNP MSP Bill Kidd Nuclear energy is not wanted nor needed in Scotland, so with this vote the LibDems have reinforced the fact that they could scarcely be more out of step with the priorities of people in Scotland if they tried. During their time in office the LibDems have become the party of U-turns and broken promises, and true to form they’ve scrapped another pledge at their conference today. Having consistently set out their stall opposing new nuclear energy, they now back plans for a new generation of the horrendously expensive white elephants. Backing new nuclear energy can only be done at appalling cost and at the expense of renewable energy – the last thing that Scotland needs if we are to fully harness our enormous renewables potential. (I'm sorry the blogging has been a bit slow today. My laptop has been freezing up. I'm still trying to get it working properly.) • Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander exposed a split at the top of the Lib Dems over the threat of a house price bubble. In an interview in the Guardian on Saturday Vince Cable, the business secretary, said that he was concerned about house prices rising too fast and that the Treasury should respond by partially shelving the Help to Buy scheme coming into force next year. But Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News's Murnaghan programme that he did not see a potential boom as a problem. We are a million miles away form a housing bubble in this country Of course in central London, in Kensington and Chelsea, you see very high house prices but I don't think we should allow the tail of central London to wag the dog of this policy. I don't think that we need to rethink this policy [Help to Buy], not least because we have always said it's a time-limited policy for three years, after which the financial stability committee of the Bank of England will be able to make a judgment. But right now the problem in this country, the problem in my constituency in Inverness or here in Glasgow or across vast swathes of England and Wales is not a housing boom, it is getting construction going, it's getting opportunities for people to own their own home. That's the problem we should be dealing with now. Clegg made similar comments on the Andrew Marr show (see 11.49am) although Clegg did not disown Cable's proposal so bluntly. (Alexander's comments will reinforce claims that relations between him and Cable are very poor - see 10.36am.) • Clegg has suggested that Lib Dems are pinning their hopes for the next general election on voters losing faith in single-party governments. In his interview on the Marr show, Clegg said there were \"millions of people out there who aren’t going to be satisfied by the right-left, blue-red old-style pendulum single-party politics that have blighted governments in this country for so long\". He repeated what is becoming the key claim of the conference: that Labour on its own could not be trusted to deliver a stronger economy and that the Conservatives on their own could not be trusted to deliver a fairer society. Although Clegg rejected claims that he favoured one party over the other as potential coalition partners after 2015, there were hints that he would prefer a second deal with the Conservatives. He said that the Lib Dems would go into the election asking the electorate to “let us finish the job and finish the job fairly”. And he said he did not know what the Labour party believed on key issues. • Clegg has said that raising to tax threshold to take people on the minimum wage out of tax would be a key demand for the Lib Dems in any coalition negotiations. • Clegg has said that the Scottish people will not be given a chance to vote on their main preference, greater devolution, in the independence referendum that is to be held in just over a year's time. • Lib Dem delegates have rejected a call for the party to declare itself opposed to building new nuclear power stations. By 230 votes to 183, they voted instead in favour of nuclear power stations playing a \"limited role\" in Britain's electricity supply, provided they do not receive any public subsidy for new build. • Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has accused some Conservative members of the coalition of having a \"stone age\" approach to environmental issues. In his speech to the conference, Davey singled out Owen Paterson, the Eurosceptic environment secretary. I want to be fair to Owen Paterson. He was brilliant over the horsemeat scandal – the way he demanded European Union action was impressive. Owen made the case for Britain’s membership of the EU better than any Conservative I’ve ever heard. I’m not sure he meant to ... [Paterson] would cull wind turbine faster than he can cull badgers. But we have prevented the stone-age wing of the Conservative party from destroying our leading renewables industry. In his speech Davey also announced a £20m pilot scheme to give financial incentives to firms that save energy. And he confirmed that he would promote the development of wind energy plants on Scottish islands by a special price guarantee. David Laws, the Lib Dem education minister who is drawing up the party's election manifesto, has been giving interviews. Here are some of the news lines. • Laws said the government has not got the balance right on \"secret courts\". What the party is saying is that we're not sure at the moment whether the balance between those things is right. We do understand we need to make sure that people who potentially are committing serious offences can be prosecuted, that secret intelligence can be taken into account without compromising our sources. We're going to try between now and the next general election to develop a new policy in this area to get the balance between those two conflicting priorities right. On Wednesday delegates will debate a manifesto themes paper saying the Lib Dems should develop an alternative to secret courts. • He said Michael Gove, the Conservative eduction secretary, was \"widely misunderstood\". Gove was \"passionate about education\" and \"very demanding about standards\", Laws said. \"I think he is widely misunderstood. I have a very good relationship with him.\" • He said the \"biggest, most expensive\" policy in the coalition agreement, lifting the income tax threshold to £10,000, was a Lib Dem policy, \"straight out of the front page of the Lib Dem manifesto.\" Ed Davey, the energy secretary, is speaking to the conference now. I'll post a summary of his speech when I've seen the full text. Do you know your Lib Dem cabinet ministers? There's a Guardian quiz you could try. The debate on energy policy has policy has just finished. There were two contentious votes. Voting had the option of voting to rule out building any more nuclear power stations. But this proposal was defeated, and instead the Lib Dems voted, by 230 votes to 183, for an alternative clause saying nuclear power could play \"a limited role in electricity supply\" provided concerns about safety, cost and waste are met and provided there is no public subsidy for new build. And there was a vote on shale gas. The motion said limited shale gas extraction should be permitted, subject to strict regulation. But delegates backed an amendment suggesting tougher conditions, including half of the tax take from shale gas going into a low carbon transition fund. • Nick Clegg played down fears that the Treasury's Help to Buy scheme could fuel a housing boom. In an interview in the Guardian on Saturday Vince Cable, the business secretary, suggested that the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, due to be introduced next year, should only apply in areas where the housing market is flat. But Clegg defended the idea of applying the policy nationally. “Clearly in parts of the country, notably central London, the housing market is now marching forwards, but you can’t set a national policy – neither the government nor the Bank of England – based only on what happens in Kensington and Chelsea,” he said. He also said that Cable himself “will be the first to acknowledge we are nowhere near, yet, the peak of that unsustainable housing bubble”. • He said the Lib Dems would appeal at the next election to the “millions” of people who did not want a majority government led by the Conservatives or Labour. I think there are millions of people out there who aren’t going to be satisfied by the right-left, blue-red old-style pendulum single-party politics that have blighted governments in this country for so long. • He said his message to the electorate in 2015 would be “let us finish the job and finish the job fairly”. But he said this did not mean he would go into the next election favouring a second coalition with the Conservatives, he said. The Conservatives could take Britain out of the EU single market, he said. • He said the next Lib Dem manifesto would include “die in the ditch” commitments that the party would not be willing to sacrifice in a coalition. He would not say what they would be, but indicated that “tax fairness” would be one of them. “We are committed as a party, and I am very committed to this, to raising the [tax] allowance further such that you pay no income tax equivalent to the minimum wage - everybody on the minimum wage pays no income tax. • He said that, in the event of a hung parliament, the party with the “clearest mandate” from the British people would have the right to try to form a government first. That could be in tems of most votes or most seats, he said. The Lib Dems would negotiate first with this party, he indicated. But he did not say what they would do if one party got most votes and another got the most seats. • He said that he was not discussing after the Tories the prospects of a second coalition after the general election. “If they came to me with ‘let’s talk about another coalition agreement’, I’d give them pretty short shrift because you have to let the British people have their say first,” he said. • He said Labour under Ed Miliband had not spelt out what it really believed. The biggest question for Labour, it seems to me as an outsider from the Labour party is they’ve got to spell out what they believe in. I don’t know what they believe on schools or on welfare or on pensions … They also have to show some responsibility both for the past and also some clarity about what they would do in the future and that, at the moment, is absent. • He said his personal feelings about David Cameron and Ed Miliband would not affect what the Lib Dems would do in the event of a hung parliament. His feelings about them would be “trumped” by his belief that “coalition government has to be a legitimate government following the instruction manual handed to us by millions of British voters,” he said. • He said there was “not the remotest possibility” of a Lib Dem/Labour coalition in 2010 because “the numbers didn't add up”. • He said the Lib Dems would not support any Home Office plan to impose a bond on immigrants from some countries seeking to visit Britain if they were “an indiscriminate way of clobbering people”. But, stressing that the government has not yet decided what to do about bonds, he suggested the Lib Dems could support them if applied to people who might otherwise have their visa applications turned down. And the idea would have to be piloted, he said. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. And here are the best Lib Dem-releated comment articles from today's papers. • James Forsyth in the Mail on Sunday says Clegg is only worried about 25% of the electorate. The Nick Clegg who arrives in Glasgow for his party’s conference is a far tougher, more battle-hardened creature than the genial politician who burst on to the national stage in the televised Election debates three and a half years ago. Gone is the Lib Dem desire to be liked, replaced by hard-headed electoral calculation. One close ally of the Deputy Prime Minister declares: ‘It doesn’t matter if 75 per cent of the country hate Nick as long as the 25 per cent who’ll consider voting for us like him – and they do.’ Aware of the vitriol directed at their leader, the Lib Dems have conducted extensive polling on what voters think of him. One of those closely involved in the Election planning says: ‘In the places where we’ve looked intimately at how people feel about Nick, we’re happy with the results.’ Forsyth also says that relations between Vince Cable and Danny Alexander are dire. There are tensions, though, within the Lib Dem high command. I understand that relations between Cable and Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, are particularly bad. One person who has to deal with both tells me: ‘They can barely speak to each other.’ This divide between the two Lib Dem Cabinet Ministers who deal with the economy is an especial problem for the party because its big challenge is to ensure it is given credit for the recovery. As one of those closest to Clegg observes: ‘The lesson from other countries is that the junior coalition partner gets the blame when things go badly but not the credit when things go well.’ • Matthew d'Ancona in the Sunday Telegraph says Clegg has transformed the Lib Dems from a party of protest to a party of government. The reality, however, is that Clegg is not trying to strike a balance between two wings. He is trying to create an entirely new party, with an entirely new purpose. Before the formation of the Coalition in May 2010, the Lib Dems were essentially a campaign movement with an electoral wing. They were a force in local government, in the European Parliament, and at Westminster – never more so in the post-war era than under Charles Kennedy, whose leadership secured 62 seats in the 2005 election. As a protest movement, the Lib Dems prospered in by-elections – notably Sarah Teather’s triumph in Brent East in 2003 at the height of Kennedy’s nimble opposition to the Iraq war. Her decision to stand down as an MP, announced last week, is a bookend not only to her decade-long parliamentary career, but also to the development of the Lib Dems’ identity. What she personified is precisely what Clegg wants to consign to the movement’s past. • Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer says the Lib Dems are moving back towards a position of “equidistance” between the main parties. As we get closer to the election, the Lib Dems will shift into a position more neutral between Labour and the Conservatives – what they used to call \"equidistance\". That process will begin this week. Nick Clegg plans to devote a meaty chunk of his leader's speech to listing all the things he has blocked the Tories from doing. He calls it \"lifting the veil\" or \"showing how the sausages are made\". This raises an interesting issue of coalition etiquette. How attractive do the Lib Dems look as coalition partners – to the Tories or to Labour – if they are going to hiss and tell on the other party as an election comes up on the horizon? It also invites retaliation. The Conservatives say they have dossiers filled with \"loopy\" Lib Dem ideas that they put a stop to. A prolonged display of the coalition's soiled underwear is unlikely to be to the benefit of either party. The Lib Dem leader has told colleagues that he is conscious of these hazards and is aware that what he will say will sound \"very rude\" in Tory ears. Yet he will do it anyway. He thinks it is vitally necessary to clarify and justify their role in this coalition. He also believes it helps to make his case that one of the values of having Lib Dems in government is that they can put the brake on the excesses of both the Tories and Labour. It is also another way of avoiding the dangerous question: which of them do you actually prefer? • John Rentoul in the Independent on Sunday says Tim Farron and Vince Cable are vying to be the person who could lead the Lib Dems into coalition with Labour. If Labour were the largest party, though, that would be the end of Clegg’s leadership. In a reversal of the balance of power in the 2010 coalition talks, in which the Lib Dems insisted that Labour dump its leader if it wanted to talk terms, Labour would tell the Lib Dems in 2015 that Clegg’s departure would be a condition of co-operation. Not only do Labour people regard Clegg as a crypto-Tory, his survival in office would look as if a permanent political elite had defied the verdict of the people. That is the subtext of what is happening in Glasgow: the Vince Cable versus Tim Farron leadership contest. Farron, MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and president of the party, last week praised Ed Miliband with all the subtlety of a mallet with “mallet” written on its head. Cable has gone for the more subtle approach of trying to be an effective Cabinet minister who was once a special adviser to John Smith. Notably, he has been responsible for two of the Government’s most unpopular policies – tuition fees and Royal Mail privatisation – and yet still comes across as the nation’s favourite wise uncle. • Adam Boulton in the Sunday Times (paywall) says time is on Clegg's side. There is evidence that the activists rather than the leader may be out of step with the people who might vote for them. Lib Dem activists routinely express a preference for a Lab-Lib coalition next time, but in our YouGov poll three-quarters of those who still back the Lib Dems favour a repeat of the current arrangement. Clegg still has time on his side. If the economic cycle continues to keep pace with the political cycle, he aims to present his party to the electorate as one seasoned by government, prepared to take difficult decisions but differentiated from the other two parties retreating to the extreme ends of their comfort zone. • Lord Adonis, the Labour peer, in the Observer says Clegg has played his hand badly since the election. Clegg seems to have taken to heart Arthur Balfour's dictum that in politics \"nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\", the prize being simply to occupy office. He has given David Cameron a large majority in return for little more than the power to apply an occasional brake – a power he would have possessed more strongly had the Tories formed a minority government. For the Lib Dems, it has been an exercise in irrelevance. For the country, it has yielded years of austerity economics for which they never voted. As promised earlier, here are the best Lib Dem stories from today's papers. • Ed Davey tells the Sunday Times (paywall) that he has been engaged in “trench warfare” with the Tories in government over green policies. The paper says Davey is speaking out because Nick Clegg wants to be more open about where the Lib Dems disagree with the Conservatives. Davey told The Sunday Times this weekend that Tory MPs made his job a “constant battle”. He singled out his cabinet colleague Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, for particular criticism. He accused Paterson of stirring up trouble over wind farms and plotting to produce a “partial” and potentially inaccurate report on renewable energy. “I’ve had Owen Paterson making noises against wind, and you know that’s not what the agreed coalition position is,” he said. “So you know I’ve stuck to the agreed coalition position. Not everybody has.” Davey also accused “weak and irresponsible” Tories of hampering efforts to make the coalition “the greenest government ever”. • Jane Merrick and Brian Brady in the Independent on Sunday say most Lib Dem activists want a coalition with Labour rather than with the Tories if there is a hung parliament after 2015. According to the poll for The Independent on Sunday by the respected grassroots website Liberal Democrat Voice, four out of 10 party activists want the Lib Dem leader to form a coalition with Labour in 2015, while a further 15 per cent would like to see a Labour-Lib Dem “confidence and supply” agreement, whereby the third party is free to vote against the Government but agrees not to bring down the Government or vote against its Budget. In a major blow to some senior Lib Dems close to Mr Clegg who are planning a second term of coalition with the Conservatives, only 15 per cent want to see this deal, while 6 per cent would back a Conservative-Lib Dem “confidence and supply”. • Jane Merrick in the Independent on Sunday says the Lib Dems are split over fracking. Nick Clegg today faces a split in his party over fracking, as green campaigners claimed the Lib Dems risked undermining their commitment to the environment if they backed the controversial drilling for shale gas. In a surprise finding, a Liberal Democrat Voice poll reveals that a majority of Lib Dem members are in favour of fracking, with 46 per cent for and only 36 per cent against. A motion to promote “green growth and green jobs”, to be debated in Glasgow today, asks the party to back fracking. Yet some senior figures, including Tim Farron, the party’s president, are believed to have major reservations about a full-scale rush to allow drilling across the UK. The poll also reveals that the Lib Dems’ opposition to nuclear power has softened, with 65 per cent of members in favour of it being in the energy mix and 29 per cent against. • Daniel Boffey in the Observer says the government will crack down on schools that force parents to buy overpriced uniforms. David Laws, the education minister, said he would provide new guidance to urge schools to end the practice of using a single uniform supplier, which stops parents from shopping around to find the best deal. He announced the policy at the Liberal Democrats' annual conference in Glasgow after research showed that parents were losing out by around £52m a year. • The Observer says Paddy Ashdown has used an interview to tell his party to prepare for a second coalition with the Tories. Paddy Ashdown has urged his restive party to prepare for the possibility of a second coalition with the Tories, saying the Conservatives have proved surprisingly good and trustworthy partners for the Liberal Democrats in government. In terms that will alarm some on the left of his party, who resent working with the Conservatives, the former Lib Dem leader admits that he was wrong to have pushed so hard for a deal with Labour after the 2010 election, when Nick Clegg was moving towards the Tories. \"I was wrong and Nick was right,\" he says. Speaking to the Observer ahead of the Lib Dems' conference in Glasgow, Ashdown says that, \"broadly speaking\", the coalition \"has been a success\", and that dealing with the \"hated\" Tories has been a lot easier than he had imagined. While insisting he still has \"no idea\" what David Cameron stands for, and stressing that Labour may turn out to be equally decent partners in a future centre-left coalition, he describes the prime minister as \"clever\" and \"very, very quick on his feet\". By contrast, he offers no such plaudits for Ed Miliband. And this is what Ashdown has to say about Clegg. [Clegg] is one of the most gifted politicians, if not the most gifted politician, of our generation. He's grown enormously, not least in his capacity to understand his mistakes, as well as to begin to recognise at last his successes. Look at the three leaders. Cameron in trouble with his party; Miliband going through a difficult patch. Nick goes into this conference in far less trouble than the other two. The thing I've always said might start happening is people standing back and saying: 'Hang on. Have we underestimated this guy?' • And Ashdown tells the Huffington Post that the lib Dems would be “crazy” to pull out of the coalition early. Lord Ashdown has warned Liberal Democrats they would be \"completely crazy\" to pull out of the coalition before the general election, praised Nick Clegg as an \"outstanding\" political figure who deserves to be prime minister and said the outcome of the next election is \"delicious\" in its unpredictability. • Lembit Opik, the former Lib Dem MP, says in the Mail that Nick Clegg should resign as party leader. Having entered government, the party had everything to play for. Sadly, Clegg’s performance is a damning record of underperformance. Lib Dems are fed a remorseless e-mail diet of ‘evidence’ showing how much the Lib Dems have achieved in government. What the public see is a diet of U-turns, apologies and political drift, presided over by a man who does not appear to appreciate the public rage against this catalogue of broken promises ... What should happen next? I invite Clegg to announce his resignation as Leader, while continuing as Deputy Prime Minister. This split is not radical: Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George did precisely this, realising that doing both full time jobs is impossible. This will enable another senior party member – probably Vince Cable – to lead the party into the next General Election. • Jane Merrick in the Independent on Sunday interviews Jo Swinson, the business minister. • Lord Ashcroft at ConservativHome reports on the finding of a poll he has conducted in the 40 most marginal Conservative constituencies. The encouraging news for the Tories, such as it is, is that Labour have made no further progress in their top targets seats than they had when I conducted a similar exercise in 2011. Voters here are slightly more likely than not to think Britain is heading in the right direction, and the opposition has not fully won their confidence: the Conservatives are more likely to be seen as willing to take tough decisions, and being clear about what they stand for. They still see David Cameron as better leadership material than Ed Miliband: 38 per cent say Cameron would make the best Prime Minister, compared to 28 per cent for the Labour leader. Despite this, Labour’s lead in these seats has grown from nine to 14 points over the last two years, largely because of the defection of Tory voters to UKIP. Labour’s share is 43 per cent, down a point since 2011, but the Conservatives have fallen to 29 per cent with the Lib Dems on eight per cent and UKIP on 11 per cent – a rise of eight points since the last election. This represents an 8.5 per cent swing from the Conservatives to Labour in these seats – enough for Labour to win all 32 of them, plus a further 66 if it were repeated in Conservative-Labour contests elsewhere. Q: Some poll suggest the Scottish independence referendum could be close than people think. Clegg says he thinks people want home rule (ie, further devolution). But that is not on the ballot paper, he says. And that's it. The interview is over. Q: Will you carry on in politics whatever happens at the next election? Clegg says he genuinely thinks the Lib Dem decision to form a coalition, and get it hand dirty, was right. There are millions of people who will not be satisfied by the blue-red pendulum of two-party politics, he says. Q: Can you stop Theresa May's plan for some immigrants to have to pay a bond to secure a visa? Clegg says this has not been agreed. He has no interest in a bond that could be used to \"clobber\" immigrants. Q: Can you stop it? Yes, of course, says Clegg. Q: What did you think of the \"Go home\" immigration vans? Clegg says he thought they were a bad idea. They won't be rolled out nationwide. Q: What if there were a hung parliament and you could form a coalition with either Labour or the Tories? A photo-finish, says Clegg. Q: Yes. Clegg says he will give Marr the same answer he gave before 2010. He would talk to the party that did best. Andrew Marr is interviewing Nick Clegg now. (I missed the first few minutes because I've had technical problems with the blog.) Q: Are you discussion with the Tories another coalition? No. Q: And you would not have a problem with working with Ed Miliband? No, says Clegg. He says he has no problem with the idea of coalition in principle. Q: So you don't agree with Jeremy Browne, who said they are not equipped to run the country? Clegg does not answer this directly. But he says he thinks Labour does not have clear policies. It's cold, it's wet, and, according to the forecast, the weather is going to get even worse. Yup, the party conference season has started. I'm in Glasgow where the Lib Dems are about to start the first full day of their autumn conference. I was meant to be here to blog the opening yesterday afternoon but, for various reasons, my travel plans went up the spout. I'm sorry about that. Nick Clegg will be giving a big interview on the Andrew Marr show shortly. I'll be covering that in detail. And in the hall the most interesting debates will probably be those covering nuclear power and tuition fees. One tradition at Lib Dem conferences is that there's normally a moment when someone starts slagging off the Guardian. Last night I was telling colleagues that I has managed to sit through the last bit of the afternoon debate, the rally and a fringe meeting without anyone having a go at us. I spoke to soon. Today the Observer (part of the Guardian family) has an interview with Paddy Ashdown. And he's not very happy about it. I'll post more Lib Dem stories from the Sunday papers later. Here's the agenda for the day. Around 9am: Nick Clegg is interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. 9am: Delegates debate an increase in the recommended membership fee (from £65 to £67.) 9.35am: Alistair Carmichael, the chief whip in the Commons, and Lord McNally, the leader in the Lord, present parliamentary reports. 10.20am: Debate on green growth and green jobs. Delegates will vote on whether rejecting new nuclear power stations should be party policy. 11.50am: Debate on cycling. 12.30pm: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, gives a speech. 1pm: Fringe meetings, including Charles Kennedy on the European elections and Danny Alexander on replacing Trident. 2.15pm: Tim Farron, the party president, presents a report from the federal executive. 2.35pm: Delegates debate an addition to the party rule book making it clear that members must not bully or harass other members. (This was proposed in the light of the misconduct allegations - which he denies - involving Lord Rennard.) 3.05pm: Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, gives a speech. 3.25pm: Delegates debate a motion on higher education, including an amendment saying tuition fees should be reviewed after 2015 and \"if necessary ... eliminated in a feasible and cost-effective way\". 5pm: Debate on protecting children from online pornography. I'll be covering all the news from the conference, as well as bringing you the best comment and reaction from the web. I'll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm and another at about 6pm.

This weekend it is French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault talking nuclear power. Next week there will be Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop. Welcome to Beijing, the must-visit destination for world leaders who need cash or clout. Rarely a week goes by without some leading dignitary passing through. African leaders come seeking investment or offering land deals. Europeans swing by eager for access to Chinese markets (Angela Merkel is almost a regular in Beijing, and Vladimir Putin's first overseas visit after his return to the presidency last year was Beijing). The principal reason is obvious: the world's second-largest economy is primed to invest abroad, and western nations are in no position to wave it away. But the promised land has a dark side – for many western leaders, China's economic allure has eclipsed its unscrupulous politics. They know that criticising China's treatment of dissidents, its repressive ethnic policies and its increasing aggression abroad will carry an economic price. They're afraid of getting burned. \"I think China obviously uses its growing economic power to send a clear message, or signal, to foreign leaders,\" said Jingdong Yuan, an expert in international affairs at Sydney university's centre for international security studies. \"The Chinese government might close some doors, or make things more difficult if they see foreign leaders deliberately challenge their interests.\" Analysts have criticised Cameron's three-day trip to Beijing, which ended on Wednesday, as little more than an extended apology for meeting the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in 2012, causing Beijing to freeze inter-ministerial Sino-UK ties. During the trip, he played table tennis with Chinese schoolchildren, traipsed along Shanghai's Bund with a prominent entrepreneur, and opened an account on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog. Yet what Cameron neglected to do is arguably more significant. He did not criticise China for its recent unilateral declaration of administrative control over a swath of airspace in the east China sea, bringing territorial disputes with Japan to a boil. He did not mention China's human rights record, its environmental degradation, nor the Dalai Lama. Biden, who left Beijing on Thursday night, did tackle a few tough issues: in meetings with China's president Xi Jinping and premier Li Keqiang, he emphasised that Washington has a \"firm position and expectations\" on the country's behaviour in the east China sea. He strongly criticised China for withholding visas from foreign journalists as retaliation for critical coverage, and encouraged a group of US visa applicants to \"challenge the government\", espousing the rejection of orthodoxy as a traditional American value. Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College in California, said: \"The Americans still say what they want, regarding human rights in China and Tibet, but western European leaders have been quite effectively intimidated – China has succeeded in teaching them a so-called lesson. No leader who dares to have a meeting with the Dalai Lama can escape punishment by Beijing.\" Cameron arrived in China with more than 130 businesspeople, the UK's largest trade delegation, and signed a raft of deals. He pushed for an EU-China free trade agreement and Chinese investment in a British high-speed rail project. He signed a £45m deal to export pig semen to China, to improve the quality of the country's pork. Yet the outcomes of such vaunted trade deals are often unclear, said Pei – on official visits, both sides' top priorities are ultimately image-related. European leaders want to prove that they're leveraging China's economic resources for benefits at home. Chinese leaders wants to show domestic audiences that they occupy the high ground over western, democratic societies. \"I think Chinese leaders are smart enough to know that they're not going to change the suspicion, the ideological hostility towards China in the West,\" said Pei. \"But they're going to squeeze every bit of PR out of these visits that they can.\" Jonathan Holslag, a research fellow at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, said that since president Xi and premier Li took the reins last autumn, they have proved far more straightforward than their predecessors. Western politicians have been cowed. \"I think the Chinese have learned to play the game very well – and it's not a game of real power, it's a game of protocol, and it's a game of pretence,\" he said. \"This creates a sort of vicious cycle. The Chinese pretend to be powerful, we position ourselves as weaker than we really are, and this allows the Chinese to push harder.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2017/sep/07/hurricane-irma-live-latest-updates-caribbean","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T06:59:17Z","webTitle":"Cuba lashed by category five winds as storm heads to US – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/07/hurricane-irma-live-latest-updates-caribbean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/sep/07/hurricane-irma-live-latest-updates-caribbean","fields":{"headline":"Cuba lashed by category five winds as storm heads to US – as it happened","bodyText":"This live blog is closing. Follow the latest developments on our new live blog: Hurricane Irma, which briefly dipped to category four intensity, is now back up to category five and has made landfall in Cuba. Irma is now forecast to hit the Florida Keys on Sunday morning, moving over south-west Florida by Sunday afternoon, then crossing the entire state over approximately 30 hours of ferocious winds and rains. On Saturday, Irma continues to rake the north coast of Cuba, where it first hit the Camaguey archipelago on Friday night. It is the first category five storm to make landfall in Cuba for almost a century. Saturday will also see tropical storm-force winds lash Florida, ahead of Irma’s arrival. Outer rain bands have already reached the peninsula. Florida has ordered 5.6 million people – a quarter of the state’s population – to evacuate, warning that those who do not leave cannot expect rescue services to reach them once Irma hits. A curfew comes into effect in Palm Beach from 3pm on Saturday. Florida governor Rick Scott warned on Friday: If you are planning to leave and do not leave tonight, you will have to ride out this extremely dangerous storm at your own risk. In Georgia, 540,000 people on the coast received mandatory evacuation orders. The Bahamas meteorological office said the main island of New Providence had been spared the worst as Irma passed close by, but the southern Bahamas had been more badly hit. At least 23 people have been confirmed killed in the Caribbean so far. The first victim of Irma was two-year-old Carl Junior Francis in Barbuda. Eleven died on French St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, two on Dutch St Maarten and one in Anguilla. A teenage surfer died off Barbados in waves churned up by Irma, and four deaths were reported on the British Virgin Islands that have yet to be corroborated. Clear-up efforts on Caribbean islands – to which Britain, France and the Netherlands have sent support – have been hampered by the approaching Hurricane Jose. Jose is forecast to hit islands already ravaged by Irma – including Barbuda, Anguilla, St Maarten, St Martin and St Barthélemy – from Saturday. Hurricane Jose, currently a category four, is “almost category five”, the US National Hurricane Center has said. But Katia – formerly a category one hurricane as it made landfall in Mexico – has been downgraded to a tropical storm. Cuba’s Meteorology Institute confirms the US National Hurricane Center verdict: Irma has made landfall there at category five intensity. A report on its website reads: Hurricane Irma is striking Camaguey and Ciego de Avila as a category five hurricane … The Camaguey weather station recorded a 200kph (124mph) gust of wind from the northwest, causing the wind gauge to be destroyed. In Cayo Coco a gust of 187km per hour [was recorded]; in Nuevitas a gust of 161km per hour and in Camaguey of 123km per hour. Here is what the latest forecast says about Hurricane Irma’s predicted path: Irma is moving toward the west near 12mph (19kph). A turn toward the northwest is expected by late today [Saturday]. On the forecast track, the centre of Irma will move near the north coast of Cuba today, near the Florida Keys Sunday morning, and then near the southwest coast of Florida Sunday afternoon. The US National Hurricane Center says Jose remains a category four storm as it heads towards the Leeward Islands on Saturday. But Katia – formerly a category one hurricane as it made landfall in Mexico – has been downgraded to a tropical storm. A 2am local time advisory from the US National Hurricane Center confirms that Irma is still moving directly over Cuba’s Camaguey archipelago and remains at category five. Irma is currently 85 miles (135km) east-south-east of the Cuban northern city of Caibarién, and about 275 miles (440km) from Miami, with wind speeds of 160mph (260kph). Hurricane warnings are in place for the following areas: Cuban provinces of Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, Villa Clara, and Matanzas North-western and central Bahamas and Ragged Island Florida Keys Lake Okeechobee Florida Bay Volusia/Brevard county line southward around the Florida peninsula to Anclote River Basil Dean, from the Bahamas meteorology department in Nassau, says the effects of Irma in some parts of the Bahamas has not been as severe as was feared (the full force of the hurricane was instead felt in Cuba). Dean told CNN: Right now we’re having some light rains here in the capital … we don’t expect much more than we’re experiencing right now, even though we’re under a hurricane warning. New Providence [the island where Nassau and most of the population are] is pretty much well to the east of the centre circulation and we anticipate the condition will be pretty much the same: occasional rain showers developing here and there. But, he added, the island group did not escape unscathed: Ragged Island would have been the last island in the Bahamas that would have experienced the hurricane-force winds. In the south-east Bahamas, including the Turks and Caicos Islands, there’s been a major impact from Irma … The eye passed directly over Ragged Island. Dutch naval commander Peter Jan de Vin has shared images of relief efforts on Sint Maarten, which is administered by the Netherlands. Dialysis patients were airlifted from the stricken island on Friday: Dutch troops dropped leaflets from helicopters warning residents of the approaching Hurricane Jose and advising them to move to shelters: The evacuation ongoing in Florida and beyond is among the largest in US history. In Florida, 5.6 million people – that’s more than one-quarter of the state’s population – have been ordered to leave, In Georgia, 540,000 people on the coast received mandatory evacuation orders. Florida governor Rick Scott warned on Friday: If you are planning to leave and do not leave tonight, you will have to ride out this extremely dangerous storm at your own risk. Officials said they would not risk sending rescue and emergency services personnel into the heart of the storm while it raged. With Irma’s outer rain bands already brushing the Florida coast, Saturday morning is forecast to see the first tropical storm-force winds. They will build until Hurricane Irma arrives in its full intensity – forecast on Sunday morning in the Florida Keys. The outer bands of Hurricane Irma have reached the US, with rain and increased wind speeds in south Florida and the Keys. The centre of the storm remains over northern Cuba, where the Camaguey archipelago has borne the brunt. Hurricane Jose has moved closer to category five strength, with tops winds of 155mph (250kmh) as it heads towards the eastern Caribbean islands ravaged by Hurricane Irma. Jose was about 265 miles (430km) east-south-east of the northern Leeward Islands early on Saturday and is forecast to hit the outlying Caribbean islands later in the day. The US national hurricane centre said that “air force hurricane hunters find Jose even stronger … almost a category 5 hurricane”. It issued hurricane warnings for the eastern Caribbean islands of Barbuda and Anguilla, Sint Maarten, St Martin and St Barthélemy. A hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua, while tropical storm watch was in effect for Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, British Virgin Islands, and St Thomas and St John. Many of Irma’s victims have already fled their devastated islands on ferries and fishing boats for fear of Jose, which is currently ranked as a category four storm that could punish some places all over again this weekend. “I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to know that further damage is imminent,” said inspector Frankie Thomas of the Antigua and Barbuda police. These graphics from the US National Hurricane Center show first, the most likely arrival times of tropical storm-force winds (which will precede Irma’s full-strength landfall), and second, the earliest times such winds could arrive. Although the hurricane itself is forecast to arrive on Sunday morning, Florida will be seeing extremely strong winds from Saturday morning, sweeping up through the state. Cuba – at just after midnight – is currently bearing the brunt of Irma, as it made landfall in the north of the country and returned to category five intensity. Reuters reports: The scenes along Cuba’s north central coast were gradually coming to resemble the horrors of those of other Caribbean islands over the last week as Irma barrelled in for a direct hit at Ciego de Avila province around midnight. Choppy seas, grey skies, sheets of rain, bending palm trees, huge waves crashing over sea walls and downed power lines filled state-run television’s evening newscast. Irma was forecast to bring dangerous storm surges of up to 10ft (3m) on parts of Cuba’s northern coast. Meteorologists warned that by Saturday morning scenes of far greater devastation were sure to emerge as Irma worked her way along the northern coast westward through Sancti Spiritus and Villa Clara provinces. The area is home to pristine keys with more than 50 hotels and fine beaches, vital money-makers for the cash-strapped government. Residents in the central province of Camaguey hunkered down on Friday night. “There are really strong gusts of wind. It is pouring off and on, and the lights are out,” Anaida Gonzalez, a retired nurse, said by telephone. Florida’s Palm Beach county has said it will impose a curfew from 3pm Saturday, ahead of the arrival of tropical storm-force winds. Officials do not want people out in the streets – or risk them needing rescue or emergency services – as Irma approaches. Those who have not evacuated are urged to seek safe shelter. Timothy Harris, prime minister of St Kitts &amp; Nevis, has warned that the approaching Hurricane Jose will affect the islands – but, as with Irma, they should escape its worst effects. Senior meteorological officer Elmo Burke says outer rain bands from Jose will reach St Kitts &amp; Nevis overnight and into Saturday, with its closest passing late afternoon on Saturday. Sunday, at least, will bring better weather conditions. Florida governor Rick Scott has issued another plea for residents in evacuation zones – which cover 5.6 million people – to leave. Scott says evacuation orders are also being issued further up the west coast of the state, given forecasts predicting that Irma could now track west. And he warns that Floridians must be prepared to locate to the closest available shelter within their counties if they do not evacuate by noon tomorrow [Saturday]. There are currently no shelters on the vulnerable Florida Keys, whose residents have been told to go. But officials said on Friday they would open four “shelters of last resort” on Saturday at 7pm for those who had not evacuated. No services will be available at those shelters, as most officials will have left the Keys. With Irma returning to category five, and Jose close to it, a third hurricane has just made landfall – though with thankfully lesser intensity. Hurricane Katia, which is category one, has just made landfall in Mexico, north of Tecolutla, with wind speeds of 75mph (120kph). The US National Hurricane Center reassures that: Rapid weakening is forecast during the next 24 hours. Here is Irma making landfall in Cuba, where the hurricane has hit the Camaguey archipelago, just off the northern coast. The NHC forecast says Irma is now predicted to move to the Florida Keys on Sunday morning local time, then to the south-west coast of Florida by Sunday afternoon. The latest NHC update has upgraded Irma back to category five. Here are the key points: Irma is “making landfall on the Camaguey archipelago of Cuba as a category five hurricane”. Hurricane warnings have been extended in Florida northward on the east coast of Florida to the Volusia/Brevard county line, and on the west coast of Florida to Anclote River. Irma currently has wind speeds of 160mph (260kph). Storm surge warnings have been extended northward on the east coast of Florida to the Volusia/Brevard county line, and on the west coast of Florida to Anclote River, including Tampa Bay. The US National Hurricane Center confirms that Irma, which dipped slightly to category four, has returned to category five intensity. Irma has made landfall in Cuba. With Hurricane Jose hot on the heels of Irma – which left 90% of the island of Barbuda devastated – almost all of its population of around 1,400 people has been evacuated to the larger sister island of Antigua. The latest update from the US National Hurricane Center, which is monitoring Hurricane Jose, due to hit the already stricken islands of Barbuda and Anguilla on Saturday, says it is close to becoming a category 5 storm. Jose is currently 265 miles (430km) from the Leeward Islands, with wind speeds of 155mph (250kph). Where are the 5.6 million people told to evacuate their Florida homes and hotels going? Associated Press has talked to some of them: Floridians fleeing Hurricane Irma have turned freeways across the south-east US into red ribbons of brake lights as they head to Atlanta, Montgomery or Nashville to bunk with relatives, stay at campgrounds or grab hotels before the massive storm makes landfall. Because Interstate 75 north leads straight to Atlanta, thousands of the evacuees have funneled into the city. Others trekked on to Tennessee. “We just packed the car up again … and we’re going to Memphis,” Suzanne Pallot of Miami said. Pallot traveled 21 hours from Miami to Atlanta, arriving Thursday in a Mazda SUV packed with four other people, their luggage and two cats. In Florida, they found lines for gas 100 to 150 cars long. Pallot and her companions started looking for an available hotel room in Ocala, Florida, and went nearly 200 miles into Georgia. “There was absolutely nothing.” Monica Scandlen took a flight from Orlando into Nashville with her nine-year-old daughter. “You could tell they weren’t Disney families, because we all looked sort of last minute and a little worried,” said Scandlen, who is staying with friends in Franklin, Tennessee. “There were a lot more pets than I’m used to seeing.” Evacuees were being welcomed at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, which all opened vast campgrounds to Irma refugees. John Glowacki of Bonita Springs said he drove north on I-75 “sometimes at 5mph, sometimes at 55, but it took us two days to get here. All the campgrounds from the Florida border to north of Atlanta are all filled, but we heard that we might be able to come to the Atlanta speedway.” Further north, in Knoxville, Tennessee, tourism officials welcomed evacuee. Some hotels were offering cheaper rates for guests fleeing the storm. Some people offered to open their homes to evacuees. Brittany Baugh, an Orlando native living in Nashville, set up a “Florida to Nashville Hurricane Evacuees” group on Facebook for people to offer and find places to stay. More than 500 people have joined. Georgia officials hope to have more than 50 shelters with 7,000 beds available by Saturday, said Homer Bryson, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. Even more drivers will be headed to central Georgia on Saturday, when state officials turn all lanes of Interstate 16 into a westbound evacuation route for residents along Georgia’s coast. Power is out in Caibarién and other areas along the northern coast of Cuba Heavy winds and rains are due to continue there throughout Friday night – it’s currently around 10.30pm local time – and into Saturday. Satellite images of Barbuda, the island first hit by Irma’s full force, appear to show it stripped of vegetation. The image on the right is before the storm; the second, after: Fema chief Brock Long says he thinks the authorities are prepared for the recovery efforts that will need to swing into place behind Irma. But, he told CNN, those efforts will need to be on a huge scale: The forecast models are in great agreement: Florida’s going to get hit. Particularly what stands out is that the forward speed of this storm is starting to slow down, which indicates it’s about to make its turn to the north. Any slight fluctuations, 20 or 30 miles, to the east or west of that track, could have big implications for either Miami or the west coast of Florida. The first impact is obviously going to be storm surges, which is the prime reason why we asked people to evacuate. Long says there are three days’ worth of commodities – food, water, hygiene kits, for example – in Florida, with further supplies being held outside the state. But he warned: Citizens of south Florida need to set their expectations that the power could be off for multiple days, if not weeks, in some areas. Fema (the US Federal Emergency Management Agency) has set up a web page to dispel myths and rumours surrounding Hurricane Irma and the Florida evacuations. You can find it here. It covers rumours including the high demand for fuel (true) and that hotels must take in pets who arrive with their evacuated owners (false) – although emergency shelters will take pets. Florida has two nuclear power plants directly in Irma’s projected path. The St Lucie plant is on the east coast, on a barrier island, while Turkey Point is 25 miles south of Miami. Florida Power and Light, which operates both plants, says the sites are prepared. Company president Eric Silagy said St Lucie and Turkey Point will be shut down 24 hours before the arrival of hurricane-force winds, adding that officials “will not take any chances, and those plants will be secure”. Silagy says the two plants are among the strongest structures in the world, Associated Press reports, encased in a 6-foot-thick (1.8m) cement structure reinforced by steel. The plants also have multiple safety systems and are elevated about 20ft (6.1m) above sea level to protect against flooding and storm surges. Turkey Point took a direct hit from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. UK relief efforts are underway on the British Virgin Islands, Press Association reports: Off the coast of the British Virgin Islands, the captain of the naval vessel spearheading Britain’s efforts described scenes of destruction. Stephen Norris, commanding officer of Royal Fleet Auxiliary Mounts Bay, told the Press Association: I haven’t seen anything on the scale of what we have seen here. It is one of those storms which I think defies all expectations.” Engineers, marines and medics are on board the ship, which delivered six tonnes of supplies to Anguilla and carried out repair work before moving to the British Virgin Islands. Norris said: We will be here as long as it takes. I will stay here as long as I possibly can to support the islands.” The UK Department for International Development said a further 20 tonnes of aide was en route to the disaster zone. The British Virgin Islands is also on tropical storm watch as Hurricane Jose approaches, while the Commonwealth islands of Barbuda and Antigua and British territory of Anguilla are on hurricane watch. This image shows Hurricane Irma (on the left, over Cuba) and Hurricane Jose (on the right, heading towards the Leeward Islands) – both category four storms: CNN’s Cyril Vanier, speaking from the Bahamas capital of Nassau, said the island group should be spared the worst of Irma – although the hurricane has yet to pass this part of the archipelago: We are waiting for the worst of it. The forecasts here have been proved slightly wrong - but in a good way … We’re talking tropical storm-force winds … We’re not expecting here in the capital Nassau anything that would really threaten the structure of buildings. There’s still a possibility of floods, there’s still a possibility of rainfall … it’s going to happen throughout the night. Vanier says people in Nassau are either heading for “whoever has the safest home” or to shelters, 24 of which are dotted across the capital. The White House says US president Donald Trump has spoken to his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to offer US support for relief efforts in the French overseas collectivities of St Martin and St Barthélemy. The two islands suffered massive damage from Irma, with the French part of St Martin (the southern side, St Maarten, is administered by the Netherlands) said to be 95% destroyed. The US National Hurricane Center says hurricane warnings are in effect in the following places: Cuban provinces of Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, and Villa Clara Central Bahamas and Ragged Island North-western Bahamas Sebastian Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Anna Maria Island Florida Keys Lake Okeechobee Florida Bay A hurricane warning means “preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion” in those areas as hurricane conditions are expected. Apart from Ragged Island, the hurricane warning for the south-eastern Bahamas has now been discontinued, as Irma has passed. There are also storm surge warnings in place for Sebastian Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Venice Florida Keys According to the NHC: A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, during the next 36 hours. CBS in Miami reports that even emergency responders in the Florida Keys are expected to evacuate ahead of Irma’s arrival: Irma is currently closing in on Caibarién, a city on Cuba’s north coast, with wind speeds of 155mph (250kph). Hurricane warnings are in place for the Cuban provinces of Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, and Villa Clara. Moving west, Irma is forecast to continue raking the north coast of Cuba, before an expected turn north-west towards Florida late on Saturday. An update from the US National Hurricane Center on Irma confirms the south-western eyewall is currently moving over the north coast of Cuba. The latest advisory from the US National Hurricane Center confirms that Irma’s successor, Hurricane Jose, remains at category four and is forecast to reach the northern Leeward Islands on Saturday. Hurricane warnings are in place for several islands already smashed by Irma: Barbuda Anguilla St Martin and St Barthélemy St Maarten Antigua is on hurricane watch. A hurricane warning means “preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion” in those areas as hurricane conditions are expected. Jose has wind speeds of up to 150mph (240kph). The chairs of the UK’s foreign affairs and development select committees have asked the government to explain its response to Hurricane Irma, which has been widely deemed as inadequate. Tom Tugendhat and Stephen Twigg wrote: Experts and many in the area have been critical of the overall level of relief currently on offer as well as the apparent lack of forward thinking once the storm’s route to Florida became more than just a possibility. We are concerned that many in the UK’s overseas territories in the Caribbean are still in grave need. In Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos, our response still requires improvement and the arrival of HMS Ocean in two weeks’ time will be later than any of us would wish. Prime minister Theresa May took personal charge of the UK government’s much-criticised response to the devastation wrought by Irma in the British Caribbean on Friday when she chaired an emergency meeting and declared British troops were working round the clock to help victims and restore basic services. But the UK response, given the scale of the devastation, looks flat-footed compared with that mounted by the French and Dutch governments. Currently in Irma’s sights, after it barrelled over the Turks and Caicos Islands, are the Bahamas and Cuba. Through Friday night and into Saturday, the hurricane is forecast to move over Cuba’s north coast and the central Bahamas, with wind speeds of up to 155mph (250kph). Irma is currently a category 4 hurricane, a dip on its peak intensity, but still with potential for widespread devastation. Some 5.6 million people have been ordered to evacuate Florida – reportedly the largest evacuation in US history. Governor Rick Scott told people who had not already left to get out now: If you are planning to leave and do not leave tonight, you will have to ride out this extremely dangerous storm at your own risk. Scott said his biggest concern, as Irma threatens lashing winds and rains, is the predicted storm surge. This animation demonstrates how swiftly such a surge can engulf homes: The first victim of Irma was two-year-old Carl Junior Francis, Associated Press reports: On Barbuda, a coral island rising a mere 125ft (38m) above sea level, authorities ordered an evacuation of all 1,400 people to neighbouring Antigua, where Stevet Jeremiah was reunited with one son and made plans to bury another. Jeremiah, who sells lobster and crab to tourists, was huddled in her wooden home on Barbuda early Wednesday with her partner and their two- and four-year-old boys as Irma ripped open their metal roof and sent the ocean surging into the house. Her younger son, Carl Junior Francis, was swept away. Neighbours found his body after sunrise. “Two years old. He just turned two, the 17th, last month. Just turned two,” she repeated. Her first task, she said, would be to organise his funeral. “That’s all I can do. There is nothing else I can do.” Virgin businessman Richard Branson – who saw out the storm in a concrete bunker on his private island, Necker – has posted from Virgin Gorda, also in the British Virgin Islands, about recovery efforts. Branson writes: Communications in and out of the BVI are still mostly down, but we have a satellite phone working to share updates … There is a huge amount of damage to buildings, but fortunately everyone we have seen so far has been OK. The boats are piled up like matchsticks in the harbour. Huge cargo ships were thrown out of the water and into rocks. Resorts have been decimated. The houses have their roofs blown off; even some churches where people sheltered have lost roofs. But the whole British Virgin Islands community is rallying round. The National Hurricane Center is warning people in Florida not to hope for a last-minute swerve from the approaching Irma. Dennis Feltgen, an NHC meteorologist and spokesman, said: This is a storm that will kill you if you don’t get out of the way. Irma’s winds will rake the whole Florida peninsula, Feltgen cautioned: Everybody’s going to feel this one. This is Claire Phipps picking up our live coverage. The Antigua and Barbuda Met Office has warned that Jose – now a category four hurricane, with wind speeds of 150mph (240kph) – could make its presence felt in the northern Leeward Islands as early as midnight. It’s currently approaching 7pm local time. Residents of Barbuda – the tiny island left desolate by Irma just days ago – are being evacuated to the larger sister island of Antigua, which suffered less damage. By 8am Saturday, Antigua News Room reports, “we could be looking at Irma-type winds”. Flooding is also expected. Shelters have opened in Antigua for those seeking refuge – again. Hurricane Irma is barrelling toward the southern Bahamas on a course toward south Florida, with extremely dangerous winds of 150mph (250kph). The hurricane’s width is larger than the state of Florida, and governors as far north as Virginia have declared emergencies. At least 23 people were confirmed killed around the Caribbean so far. The dead include 11 on French St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, two on Dutch St Maarten, one in Barbuda, and one in Anguilla. A teenage surfer died off Barbados in waves churned up by Irma, and four deaths were reported on the British Virgin Islands that have yet to be corroborated. In Florida, a 57-year-old man died from a fall while affixing storm shutters to a house. Florida braced for what may be its worst storm in living memory, with a state-wide hurricane warning and evacuations that left Miami and its environs eerily desolate. “This is a catastrophic storm our state has never seen,” said governor Rick Scott. “We can rebuild your home, we cannot rebuild your life.” Officials feared storm surges of three to 10ft (0.9-3 metres) and ordered more than a million people to evacuate from coastal areas of Florida and Georgia. Travellers clogged highways northward and the governor suspended tolls and struggled to get fuel to gas stations running out of supplies. The mayor of Miami-Dade, Carlos Gimenez, said the mandatory evacuation of some 650,000 people is the largest in the county’s history. Shelters opened all around Florida, and officials pleaded that residents in inland areas should plan to have food and water for three days minimum. The governor closed schools and universities around the state to allow for more room. “After the storm passes, we’ll be here to lift everyone up,” Scott said. “We will get through this together.” The storm is expected to land somewhere on the peninsula late Saturday or on Sunday. Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that Irma could be the most severe hurricane to ever hit the US. “It’s not a question of if Florida’s going to be impacted. It’s a question of how bad Florida’s going to be impacted.” Cuba evacuated people from coastal resorts and warned residents to move inland. The British territories of Turks and Caicos emerged from the storm’s winds battered and after massive storm surges. Hurricane Jose grew to a category four storm east of the Caribbean, with a path toward some of the same islands that have just emerged from Irma’s winds. On the tiny island of Barbuda, where an estimated 90% of buildings were destroyed, authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation to the larger island of Antigua. American, British, French and Dutch relief forces and military personnel moved to Caribbean islands hit by the storm. The US is deploying an aircraft carrier for Irma relief, and federal officials anticipate a recovery costing tens of billions. As state and federal agencies make their final pleas to Floridians, the National Hurricane Center scientist Taylor Trogdon stresses the sheer scale of hurricane Irma. The storm, currently cast its eye across the waters north of Cuba, will make landfall on the peninsula sometime late Saturday or early Sunday. Miami has become eerily desolate in anticipation of hurricane Irma, with boarded up buildings, empty streets, and plastic wrap and police cordons around gas stations. The 5pm forecast from the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service show hurricane Irma on the verge of returning to a category five storm, energized by the warm waters off Cuba and Florida. The projection looks especially dire for the Florida Keys and south-west Florida. President Donald Trump has signed a $15.3bn aid package for areas affected by hurricane Harvey, hours after Congress overcame dissent by Republicans on a spending package. The deal does not yet account for the expected high costs from hurricane Irma. In 1992, hurricane Andrew struck west of Miami, destroyed more than 60,000 homes, and killed 65 people. The recovery cost an estimated $26.5bn. Andrew struck as a category five storm, but was in some ways pales in comparison to Irma. Irma is expected to make landfall as a category four storm, but its width is far larger than Andrew’s, and it held sustained winds of 185mph for 24 hours – longer than any recorded storm. Its winds are expected to devastate south Florida, and an analysis by the reinsurance company Swiss Re estimated that its damages could cost the US more than $100bn. French authorities in St Martin and St Barts have reported two more deaths, according to the AP, and police in Broward County, Florida, have said a 57-year-old man died while preparing for the storm. The Davie Police Department said on Friday that the man, who was affixing storm shutters to the second story of a home, fell from a two-story ladder and struck his head on a patio below. The AP has also spoken with the surf instructor and family friend of a teenager who died off Barbados, in waves made dangerous by Irma. There are now 11 confirmed deaths on St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, two on Dutch St Maarten, and one person killed on Barbuda and Anguilla respectively. There were also four reported deaths on the British Virgin Islands, though local authorities have not yet confirmed the report. Hurricane Katia is approaching the coast of Mexico, the National Weather Service has said in its latest update, warning that the storm will make landfall on Friday night or early Saturday. The storm will have maximum winds around 105mph (165kph), and that “a dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by as much as five to eight feet above normal tide levels” in the area of landfall, the agency said. “Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.” The storm is expected to bring 10-15in of rain over Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo and Puebla, and two to five inches over Tamaulipas, east San Luis Potosi, western Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro and southern Veracruz. “This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especialy in areas of mountainous terrain.” Mexico is already reeling from the strongest earthquake in 85 years, which struck on Thursday night and caused the deaths of at least 58 people. The epicenter of the quake was just off Mexico’s Pacific coast. *Update: Climate Central has retracted a simulation of Irma’s potential effect on Miami and other south Florida cities, saying in a statement that it had used “an incorrect tidal point reference” in calculating the severity of floods. Mayor Sharief echoes her peers around the state, warning residents that once the storm strikes, much of the state will be paralyzed for its duration. “Our law enforcement personnel and fire department personnel will not be able to reach you,” Sharief warns. “When wind speedsreach 45mph our vehicles will no longer be able to respond to 911 calls.” Meanwhile, Miami has emptied out of nearly everyone save the journalists there to cover Irma. Broward county mayor Barbara Sharief is giving a briefing in south Florida, with a message for nearly the entire state to get garbage bins and other objects out of the streets. “Bulk pickup has stopped and they will become projectiles in the storm,” she warns. “Power outages from high wind and flooding are anticipated.” There are nearly 9,000 people in Broward County’s shelters alone, she says, and the county is opening more shelters this evening. Fort Lauderdale airport ceases service on Friday night, and will stay closed through the weekend. People who live in mobile homes have been urged to head to shelters, given that their homes are particularly vulnerable to winds and floods. In other parts of the state, mandatory evacuations have spread. Rupert Jones, the former attorney general of the British territory of Anguila, has criticzed the British government’s response to hurricane Irma, saying it is not nearly enough and lacks perspective for the enormity of the disaster. “It is a ridiculous idea that the £32 million pledged by the Uk Govt to its three overseas territories (Anguilla, BVI and Turks &amp; Caicos) for which it is responsible is fair or just,” Jones told the Guardian. “It is a PR drop in the Caribbean ocean for islands subject to devastation and inhabited by its own citizens. To put it in perspective it wasted £285 million on an unusable airport for St Helena, one of its territories in the Atlantic.” Jones’ criticisms echo those of others in the Caribbean and in Britain. The UK has sent a naval vessel, personnel, supplies and helicopters to its territories in the region, and French, American, and Dutch military and relief crews are coordinating with the recovery. Orlando’s sprawling theme parks are closing ahead of hurricane Irma, their parent corporations announced on Friday. Officials at Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando said their parks would close on Saturday and remain quiet through Monday at least, though they hope to reopen on Tuesday. SeaWorld and Tampa’s Busch Gardens announced similar plans to close Saturday afternoon or evening and reopen on Tuesday. Disney World has only closed a handful of times in its existence, including last year, when hurricane Matthew raked past the south-east coast of the peninsula. Vanessa Thompson, a teacher on the British territory of Anguilla, has recorded video of the island’s only secondary school. The buildings are in partial ruins, with roofs lifted onto the streets, walls shorn from classrooms, and debris scattered everywhere. Donald Trump’s parting remarks on hurricane Irma, which is approximately 380 miles south south-west of the US mainland. The National Hurricane Center has updated its forecast to take into account the latest from the NWS, predicting 10-15in of rain in south-east Florida through Tuesday night. Eastern Florida and coastal Georgia should expect anywhere from eight to 16in, the agency said, with flash floods and mudslides possible. Like state authorities, the agency warned that storm surges should not be underestimated. In south-west Florida, waves could move six to 12ft above ground at high tide. Reuters meanwhile has reported updates on fatalities and injuries from the Caribbean islands that have already suffered the hurricane. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency reported four deaths on the British Virgin Islands, but local authorities have not corroborated that figure. There were 21 deaths confirmed by various government officials around the region. French interior minister Gerard Collomb has said nine people were killed in St Barthelemey and French St Martin, and that seven people remain missing and 112 injured. Dutch authorities on neighboring St Maarten have reported two dead and 43 wounded. Four people were killed on the US Virgin Islands, according to a government spokesperson; three died on Puerto Rico; one person was killed on the tiny island of Barbuda; one in the British territory of Anguilla; and one person in Barbados. On Barbuda, tragedy has colored the hurried, now mandatory evacuation from the tiny island, where category four hurricane Jose is approaching. The AP reports: Stevet Jeremiah lost her 2-year-old son, her house and all her belongings when Hurricane Irma slammed into the tiny island of Barbuda. Now she is leaving the island for good. Jeremiah said her mother and other son had been sent to Antigua and she and her husband were going to follow. She said she has “nothing, not even an ID to say my name.” When it was still a category five storm, the hurricane ripped the roof off her house and filled it with water. Jeremiah said there was “so much water beating past us, we had to crawl to get to safety.” Her son was swept away in floodwaters. In Antigua, she planned to look for her surviving son and her mother, and start making arrangements for the two-year-old’s funeral. She said she has experienced hurricanes before, but “never anything like this in my life ... and I don’t ever, ever, ever want to see something like this again.” Officials in Antigua have launched a national campaign to open their homes to hurricane victims from Barbuda. “Gouging will not be tolerated, period,” Bossert says, again echoing Florida governor Rick Scott in response to a question about predatory business practices. He also says that he’s concerned about potential overflow from Lake Okeechobee, the large inland lake in south Florida. Scott said that engineers are regularly inspecting the lake’s dike and they believe that it is not at risk for breaking. Nevertheless, Scott has ordered mandatory evacuations for cities around the lake. Bossert says he’s worried about the financial resources for disaster relief. Fema is already coping with recovery from devastating floods in Houston, after hurricane Harvey, and agencies around the country are strained, especially with western wildfires. Bossert says the president, Donald Trump, will sign approval for relief funds as soon as Congress brings such a measure to his desk. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert is speaking to reporters about the US preparation for hurricane Irma. Fuel is particularly important, he says, echoing Florida governor Rick Scott. Foreign ships have been allowed to bring fuel to Florida, he says, to provide residents with the fuel to evacuate before the storm, for power during and after the storm, and for vehicles during the recovery. “At some point people are going to be on their own, so to speak, for a period of time when the flooding, the wind and the rain bear down on them,” he says. They should have enough supplies for at least a 72 hour period. Bossert warns against “hurricane amnesia”: forgetting how people lose power, communications, and mobility during and after a storm. Federal agencies are preparing for last minute variables of the storm. Bossert notes that the north-east section of the storm is the most dangerous, meaning a turn west and then north could be especially destructive to the state, with that quadrant of winds crossing across the state. On the other hand, should the eyewall cross onto land the storm will lose speed, Bossert notes. The storm, he says, “has taken lives already. It’s going to take more, unfortunately, if we’re not prepared.” Nearing the warmer waters of the Bahamas and Cuba, hurricane Irma’s winds have increased to 155mph, according to a 2pm advisory by the National Weather Service. On Cuba, Reuters reports that life has come to a near total stop. Schools and most businesses were closed, hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, and train, bus and domestic air services around the island were canceled. Airports were closing to international flights as conditions warranted. Tourists, and even the dolphins that entertain them, were evacuated. The storm was then predicted to veer north, sparing western Cuba and Havana. In the Cuban fishing town of Caibarien, residents secured their roofs and moved belongings from low-lying coastal areas to houses higher up inland as the skies clouded over. Most said they were worried but well prepared. Esteban Reyes, 65, was pushing his bicycle taxi laden with a mattress, iron and DVD player. “We are used to storms but I’m still a bit scared. But the government has taught us to be prepared and help one another,” he said. In the Bahamas, the government evacuated most people from the southern islands before the storm hit, with some 1,200 people airlifted to the capital, Nassau. The UN’s special representative for disaster risk reduction, Robert Glasser, has joined the chorus of voices linking the extraordinary frequency and force of weather events – huge hurricanes, wildfires across the American west, flooding in Nigeria and India – to the exacerbating effect of climate change. “There can be little doubt that 2017 is turning into a year of historic significance,” Glasser said, “in the struggle against climate change and all the other risks that put human life in danger and threaten the peace and security of exposed and vulnerable communities around the world who find themselves in harm’s way from hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.” We must realise that these disaster events are not natural phenomena but are a result of a built environment which is not fit for purpose and a failure to understand how we are intensifying the cocktail of disaster risk by not adequately addressing poverty, land use, building codes, environmental degradation, population growth in exposed in vulnerable settings and, most fundamentally, greenhouse gas emissions. The floods and monsoon rains across South Asia, deadly landslides and drought in Africa, the impact of four major Atlantic hurricanes, a major earthquake in Mexico with a tsunami threat to central America vividly demonstrate that we need to redouble our efforts to reduce the impact of such events in the future. They are a reminder to us all that the worst disasters which could happen have not happened yet. “If we do not succeed in understanding what it takes to make our societies more resilient to disasters then we will pay an increasingly high price in terms of lost lives and livelihoods.” Residents of Barbuda, where the prime minister estimated 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed, recall surviving hurricane Irma’s 170mph winds and huge storm surges. Florida governor Rick Scott is holding another briefing for the public, exhorting people to move now if they haven’t already. “If you’re in an evacuation zone, leave. it’s as simple as that,” he says. He suggests people to county shelters or friends’ homes away from the coasts, rather than join the mass exodus on northbound. “Don’t wait. If you’re going to leave, leave. If you’ know what’s going to happen, do it now. The mistake is when people wait.” Scott also condemns price gouging by airliners and other services, saying that the practice will not be forgotten in the aftermath of the storm. “It’s disgusting if anybody price gouges,” he says. “We have an attorney general that will prosecute people for price gouging. This is the time to help our neighbors, this is not the time to take advantage of our neighbors.” Hurricane Irma is barrelling toward the southern Bahamas on a course toward southern Florida, with extremely dangerous winds of 150mph (250kph). The storm’s eye doubled in size overnight, and the hurricane’s width is larger than the state of Florida. More than 20 people were confirmed killed around the Caribbean so far. The dead include nine on French St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, two on Dutch St Maarten, one in Barbuda, and one in Anguilla. Four deaths were reported on the British Virgin Islands but they have not been corroborated. Florida braced for what may be its worst storm in living memory, with a state-wide hurricane warning. “This is a catastrophic storm our state has never seen,” said governor Rick Scott. “We can rebuild your home, we cannot rebuild your life.” Officials feared storm surges of three to 10ft and ordered more than a million people to evacuate from coastal areas of south Florida and Georgia. Travellers clogged highways northward and the governor suspended tolls and struggled to get fuel to gas stations running out of supplies. The mayor of Miami-Dade, Carlos Gimenez, said the evacuation is the largest in the county’s history. Shelters opened all around Florida, and officials pleaded that residents in inland areas should plan to have food and water for three days minimum. The governor closed schools and universities around the state to allow for more room. “After the storm passes, we’ll be here to lift everyone up,” Scott said. “We will get through this together.” The storm is expected to land somewhere on the peninsula late Saturday or on Sunday. Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that Irma could be the most severe hurricane to ever hit the US. “It’s not a question of if Florida’s going to be impacted. It’s a question of how bad Florida’s going to be impacted.” Cuba is evacuating tourists from coastal resorts and warning residents to move inland, and the British territories of Turks and Caicos suffered nearly directly under the storm’s path. Hurricane Jose grew to a category four storm east of the Caribbean, with a path toward some of the same islands that have just emerged from Irene’s winds. On the tiny island of Barbuda, where an estimated 90% of buildings were destroyed, authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation to the larger island of Antigua. American, British, French and Dutch relief forces and military personnel started to move toward or arrive at Caribbean islands hit by the storm. Authorities in Barbados and Dutch St Maarten have reported an additional death on each island, and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency has released a statement saying that four people have died on the British Virgin Islands, raising the death toll to more than 20. Local authorities have yet to corroborate the figure from the CDEMA. On Barbados, a young surfer died earlier this week, a family friend told the AP, in powerful waves churned up by the hurricane. The storm has killed at least 19 others, including nine on the French territories of St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, one other person on Dutch St Maarten, one in Barbuda, and one in Anguilla. Officials have said they expect the death toll to increase. The CDEMA gave few details in its statement, but said that the Tortola airport is working but that it’s tower has been “compromised” by the storm. The agency estimated that 90% of Anguilla’s power infrastructure was damaged, 90% of government buildings damaged, and that the island suffered “significant damage to [its] main water supply”. Seven cities near Lake Okeechobee, a huge inland lake in southern Florida, have been given a mandatory evacuation notice. Residents have been ordered to evacuate from South Bay, Lake Harbor, Pahokee, Moore Haven, Clewiston, Belle Glade and Canal Point. Governor Rick Scott said that a critical dike on the lake was inspected on Friday morning, and will receive regular inspections as long as crews are able. He also said the US army corps of engineers assured him that the dike “will not be compromised”, though it may have some spillover, since the storm is far faster-moving than hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston. Northern Cuba and the southern Bahamas are now suffering Irma’s 150mph winds, glimpses of which are seeping through on social media. Local Bahamian broadcaster Shenique Miller has posted video of the winds. And on the British territories of Turks and Caicos, Miami Herald correspondent Jacqueline Charles tweets a photo of a flooded, desolate airport in the aftermath of the storm. Authorities warn again that everyone should leave the Florida Keys immediately. Governor Rick Scott said on Thursday that the archipelago will be entirely without support for the duration of the storm, cut off by winds and storm surges, with its hospital closed. And Irma is finding new strength in the warm waters closer to the mainland, notes meteorologist John Morales, a south Florida stalwart who saw hurricane Andrew firsthand in 1992. Hurricane Jose, east of the Caribbean and heading west, has grown to a category four storm, the National Weather Service has announced. Thousands remain trapped on St Martin, St Barts, and the Virgin Islands in Jose’s path. On the devastated island of Barbuda, officials have ordered people to evacuate to nearby Antigua, which was spared the degree of destruction. Jose is tentatively projected to veer north, into the open ocean, before nearing Cuba or the mainland, but it may yet change direction. Some forecasters also fear that the warm waters around coastal Florida – in the high 80s off parts of Palm Beach County – may reinvigorate Irma, turning the gigantic category four storm back into a category five. Footage of waves pouring into a home on Anguilla, filmed by a resident in his kitchen and provided by Rupert Jones, former attorney general of the British territory. Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s resort in Palm Beach County, has been ordered to evacuate along with other coastal stretches and barrier islands of south Florida. More than 100,000 Palm Beach County residents were given mandatory evacuation alerts on Thursday night and Friday morning, and more than a million people ordered to leave their homes along coastal areas, mostly from the densely populated Miami-Dade County. Governor Rick Scott warned that all Floridians should be ready to evacuate, if necessary: a total of 20 million people. With only about a day before hurricane Irma reaches south Florida, FlightRadar24, a site that tracks aircraft in real-time, shows the state is swarming with flights. Dozens of flights were cancelled or delayed from the region’s major airports over the last 24 hours, as people tried to leave the state. Fort Lauderdale’s international airport will close Friday night, and Miami International has warned that people should not attempt to use it as a shelter from the storm. Irma is tracking steadily toward the mainland, currently moving above Cuba’s northern coast. (Google has not yet updated its graphics to show the storm as category four.) With time running out before Irma makes land, much of south Florida has emptied out, leaving behind boarded up homes, vulnerable marinas, and scattered families and reporters bracing for the storm. Various Florida authorities are offering last minute advice for people who are barricading into their own homes before the storm. Residents can also call an emergency information hotline: 1.800.342.3557. *Update: BuzzFeed’s Jane Lytvynenko, doing yeoman’s work of countering misinformation about hurricane Irma and preparation, has received counter-counsel on the advice given by Miami Beach. A reporter asks the governor about Lake Okeechobee, where there’s concern about whether a dike will withstand the hurricane. Scott says that the dike was inspected this morning and “they don’t believe that the dike is at risk.” Expecting 10-12in of rain, “they don’t believe we’re expecting anything other than water spilling over the top.” He promises another briefing later Friday, and leaves with another appeal: “evacuate. Keep everybody safe.” “Please be compassionate with your employees,” the governor urges employers. “If you’re told to evacuate, leave. Get out quickly. Do not put yourself or your family’s life at risk.” “If you are in an evacuation zone in south Florida, you need to leave.” He stresses at length that the state is doing everything it can to get fuel around the state, and that the GasBuddy app can help guide people to where it’s available. Residents who cannot evacuate zones on their own should call 1.800.342.3557, he says. “We will do everything we can to get you out, but you have to call now if you’re in an evacuation zone. We cannot save you in the storm.” Scott adds that he’s ordered the closure of all local schools and universities to ensure that there’s as much available safe spaces. Residents still have time to reach shelters, he adds. “We are running out of time. the storm is almost here,” he says. “This is a catastrophicc storm our state has never seen. We can rebuild your home, we cannot rebuild your life. Protecting everyone’s life is our number one priority.” “Floridians are strong, we’re resilient. After the storm passes, we’ll be here to lift everyone up. We will get through this together.” Governor Rick Scott is providing an update on the monstrous storm bearing down on Florida, and warned residents that there may be storm surges from three to 10ft in parts of the state. “This storm is wider than our entire state. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,” Scott says. He thanks people who are on their way inland and to the north, and asks them for their patience. “I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I’m sure it’s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe.” Trust your local officials, Scott urges residents, saying that national guard troops and police are mobilized to help people, and that in certain parts of highways drivers can use improvised shoulder lanes. “You do not need to evacuate out of state or hundreds of miles away to stay safe,” he says, telling people to look up local shelters. Google is coordinating with state officials, Scott says, to show road closures and detours in real time. Tolls have been waived on all Florida highways. Hurricane Irma remains an “extremely dangerous” hurricane, but it has been downgraded from category 5 to 4 with slightly decreased wind speeds of 150mph (250kph), as it ploughs over the Bahamas, 400 miles south-east of Florida. Captain Stephen Russell, of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, said he fears for hundreds of islanders who ignored evacuation orders. “The destructive force of a 25ft surge: that is our greatest concern. It can really cause catastrophic results,” he said. Two other hurricanes in the region, Jose and Katia, have gained strength. Jose, now has sustained wind speeds of 125mp. In the coming days it is forecast to pass near the same Leeward Islands that were battered by Irma. A full-scale hurricane warning is in place for south Florida and mass evacuations have been ordered before Irma is expected to make landfall on Saturday. Donald Trump has warned that the impact of Irma could be “tougher” than Hurricane Harvey. Among the properties forced to evacuate in Florida is Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Brock Long, head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, warned that no one inFlorida has experienced a storm with the intensity of Irma. Cuba is evacuating tourists from coastal resorts and warning residents to move inland. The hurricane also pummelled the Turks and Caicos Islands, where power failed and the governor, John Freeman, warned residents: “Hunker down, stay where you are … Nobody can get to you – people are, for a little while, on their own.” Across the Caribbean, at least 18 people are confirmed to have died in the storm: an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, four in the US Virgin Islands, and nine in the French territory of St Martin. Lonnie Soury, a spokesman for the US Virgin Islands, said the toll was expected to rise. A state of emergency has declared on the British Virgin Islands amid unconfirmed reports of casualties. Roads are closes and communication is patchy. The first aid flight has reached the Franco-Dutch island of St Martin/St Maarten, after Dutch troops cleared the runway in St Maarten. Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte said there had been enormous destruction and upheaval including serious looting. The UK and France have also mobilised personnel and aid for their overseas territories that were caught in the onslaught. UK aid has delivered to Anguilla, and ship carrying supplies has reached the British Virgin Islands. Theresa May is chairing a meeting of the government’s emergency committee, Corbra. After complaints that the British government’s response has been slow, ministers authorised £32m in emergency aid and dispatched a military task group. HMS Ocean – currently in the Mediterranean – will be deployed but will take 10-14 days to reach the Caribbean. A voluntary evacuation began from the tiny island of Barbuda – where upwards of 90% of homes were destroyed – to its larger sister island of Antigua, with the prospect of Hurricane Jose, a category 3 storm, striking this weekend. Irma has left the Franco-Dutch island of St Martin/St Maarten like “war zone,” Belgium tourist Flaming Maarten told the Dutch Red Cross. It quotes him saying: “Everyone was prepared for the hurricane’s arrival, but no one had expected such an impact.” He said he had to flee to a friend’s house after the home he was staying in was completely destroyed “We are terrified, but we are unharmed,” Maarten said. There is no power, no water and supplies are running low, he said. All the luggage that he and is girlfriend had has been lost. “The streets are full of debris and trees,” he said. In his latest tweets Donald Trump has warned that the impact of Irma could be “tougher” than Hurricane Harvey. The death toll from Harvey which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it hit Texas, was 70 according to officials cited by Fox News. Among the properties forced to evacuate in Florida is Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to the Miami Herald reports: President Donald Trump’s seaside Mar-a-Lago resort has been ordered to evacuate because of Hurricane Irma, along with the barrier islands and low-lying areas of Palm Beach County. Trump has returned repeatedly to the private club – which he bought in 1985 – to relax and conduct state business since becoming president. The estimated death toll from the storm varies. Reuters reckons that at least 19 people have been killed. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said that nine people were killed and at least seven were missing after the hurricane crashed into France’s Caribbean islands of St. Martin and St Barts. “One hundred and twelve people were injured,” Collomb said, adding there could be more victims. Four people died in the US Virgin islands, a government spokesman said, and a major hospital was badly damaged by the wind. A US amphibious assault ship arrived in the US Virgin Islands on Thursday and sent helicopters for medical evacuations from the destroyed hospital. A man was reported missing after trying to cross a river in Cerca La Source in Haiti’s Central Plateau region. On Barbuda one person died and the eastern Caribbean island was reduced “to rubble,” Prime Minister Gaston Browne said. In the British overseas territory of Anguilla, another person was killed and the hospital and airport were damaged, emergency service officials said. Three people were killed in Puerto Rico and around two-thirds of the population had lost electricity, Governor Ricardo Rossello said after the storm rolled by the U.S. territory’s northern coast. A surfer was also reported killed in Barbados. Theresa May has spoken of the devastation in the Caribbean ahead of chairing a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergencies committee, PA reports. She went to the meeting after cutting short a visit to Lord’s cricket ground, where the Test match between England and the West Indies was suspended because of rain. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live sports extra’s Test Match Special at Lord’s, May said: “We are sitting here looking at this rain, but at least we are not in the Caribbean at the moment, when we see the terrible devastation of that hurricane that’s gone through and another one coming through as well. “I’ve just been able to talk to somebody whose family is out in Antigua, and hearing first-hand what it’s like and the steps they’ve had to take. It is devastating, absolutely devastating.” “There will be people here supporting the West Indies, people supporting England. I’m sure everybody here has at the back of their mind the terrible devastation and the impact that the hurricane has had. “We want to do everything we can and will do everything we can to support people, but also to help them rebuild.” The Met Office reckons Irma is passing over Acklins island in the Bahamas. The island is home to more than 400 people. It is feared that more than 100 ignored evacuation orders. Brock Long, head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, warned that no one in Florida has experienced a storm with the intensity of Irma. “It’s not a question of if Florida is going to be impacted, it’s a question of how bad,” he tells reporters. Speaking at Fema headquarters in Washington on Friday, Long said those in low-lying areas who’ve been told to evacuate “need to get out and heed the warning.” More than 8,000 Fema staff have been deployed to prepare for Irma and help with the continuing recovery effort from Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive flooding in southeastern Texas last week. The navy ship Mounts Bay has arrived in the British Virgin Islands, after delivering aid to Anguilla, according to the former governor John Duncan. Irma remains an extremely dangerous category four hurricane, but it has slightly weakened again, according to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center. Here are key points from the latest bulletin: Irma now has sustained windspeeds of 150mph (down from 155mph earlier today and 185mph on Thursday) as it heads across the Bahamas, 450 miles south-east of Florida. Hurricane and storm warnings for Haiti have been lifted. Storm surge warnings and watches are in place for large parts of southern Florida, and the Florida Keys, the southeastern, central and northeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and four Cuban provinces A Hurricane Watch is in effect for the Florida coast north of Jupiter Inlet to Sebastian Inlet and north of Bonita Beach to Anna Maria Island; and the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Las Tunas and Matanzas. “Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions,” it says. On the forecast track, the eye of Irma should move near the north coast of Cuba and the central Bahamas today and Saturday, and be near the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula on Sunday morning. The US states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina have been warned of “life-threatening flash floods and mudslides” from next Tuesday. Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee this afternoon, Downing Street has said, and will then decide what more action the government should take over relief efforts. There was also a Cobra meeting about Irma on Thursday, though that was chaired by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon. May’s spokeswoman said: “She’s being kept up to date constantly by officials at Downing Street, and will chair the Cobra meeting later.” The international development secretary, Priti Patel, is visiting an aid centre in Gloucestershire where supplies are being prepared to be sent to HMS Ocean, which has been diverted from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to help aid efforts. Nine people have been killed and at least seven are missing after Irma hit France’s Caribbean islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, the French interior minister has said. A further 112 people are confirmed to have been injured, and all those tolls could rise, Gérard Collomb added. Collomb’s statement raises the overall confirmed death toll to 18. The Department for International Development has sent through a breakdown of the help arriving and on it way to the Caribbean after the UK was criticised for its slow response. It said: UK aid is on the ground from Mounts Bay. Shelter kits, tin sheets and plywood to help with response and reconstruction in Anguilla. More going to British Virgin Islands from Mounts Bay DFID are sending shelter kits providing immediate relief to people who have seen their homes destroyed and we arranging flights carrying further urgently needed relief supplies. A team of British humanitarian experts were on the ground in advance of the hurricane and they are working with the authorities to direct the humanitarian response. The UK was the first to arrive at Anguilla and DFID is doubling its field presence to get even more help to the people most in need. C17 flight to Barbados – has left Brize Norton. As well as 50 troops there is humanitarian aid (such as shelters,). More aid planned to go on later flights. Today three trucks will be at the DFID Disaster Response Centre at Kemble Airfield, Gloucestershire to take humanitarian aid to meet HMS Ocean. These trucks will take 10,000 UK aid buckets and 5,000 UK aid solar lanterns. The UK has already sent emergency UK aid relief supplies including 200 shelter kits, each able to support a family of five, providing immediate relief to 1,000 people who have lost their homes. Former UN humanitarian chief Baroness Amos said it was felt the UK “did not respond” quickly enough. She told the BBC: “It’s always the people on the ground who respond first. They are looking to their national governments but they are also looking outside for as much help to come as quickly as possible. “We are now a couple of days in and I think people are feeling Britain did not respond quickly enough given we know that it is hurricane season.” The first UK aid drops have been made by helicopter to the British island of Anguilla as more aid is on the way to the British Virgin Islands, according to the latest updates from the Department for International Developments. Meanwhile, Downing Street has told reporters that Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the government’s emergency committee Cobra to discuss the response to Irma. The first Cobra meeting about Irma was held on Thursday, and was chaired by Michael Fallon, the defence secretary. Hurricane Irma remains an “extremely dangerous” hurricane, but it has been downgraded from category 5 to 4 with slightly decreased wind speeds of 155mph (250kph), as it ploughs over the Bahamas, north-east of Cuba. Captain Stephen Russell, of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, said he fears for hundreds of islanders who ignored evacuation orders. “The destructive force of a 25ft surge: that is our greatest concern. It can really cause catastrophic results,” he said. Two other hurricanes in the region, Jose and Katia, have gained strength. Jose, now has sustained wind speeds of 125mp. In the coming days it is forecast to pass near the same Leeward Islands that were battered by Irma. A full-scale hurricane warning is in place for south Florida and mass evacuations have been ordered before Irma is expected to make landfall on Saturday. Cuba is evacuating tourists from coastal resorts and warning residents to move inland. On Thursday night Irma crossed north of Haiti, causing less damage than had been feared in the beleaguered country. There were reports of some injuries and damage to buildings, but not widespread devastation. The hurricane also pummelled the Turks and Caicos Islands, where power failed and the governor, John Freeman, warned residents: “Hunker down, stay where you are … Nobody can get to you – people are, for a little while, on their own.” Across the Caribbean, at least 13 people are confirmed to have died in the storm: an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, four in the US Virgin Islands, and four in the French territory of St Martin.Lonnie Soury, a spokesman for the US Virgin Islands, said the toll was expected to rise.

A voluntary evacuation began from the tiny island of Barbuda – where upwards of 90% of homes were destroyed – to its larger sister island of Antigua, with the prospect of Hurricane Jose, a category 3 storm, striking this weekend. Terrorist suspects being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay on Cuba will not be evacuated, a Pentagon official has told Newsweek. “We have no indications that any detainees at Guantanamo Bay will need to be evacuated from the installation due to Hurricane Irma,” Major Ben Sakrisson, a Pentagon spokesman told the magazine. Officials have also opted not to evacuate the residents of the base, preferring instead to have them stay put and ride out the storm. The Governor of the British Virgin Islands, Gus Jaspert, has delivered an emotional message to islanders saying he is “heartbroken” by reports of casualties as a result of the hurricane. In an audio message on Facebook he said: I come to you with a heavy heart after experiencing and observing the extent of devastation caused by Hurricane Irma. After consultation with the Premier I have declared a state of emergency for the territory. Radio and other communication channels are extremely limited ... All of us have been affected by Irma and some more than others. Apart from the structural damage, there have sadly been reports of casualties and fatalities. I am truly heartbroken by this news. My thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you. I know many of you are concerned about what will happen in the short term over the next couple of hours and days. I would like to appeal to you to remain calm and to reassure you that we are doing all that we can to assist you. Jaspert urged islanders to monitor the course of the next Hurricane, Jose, which could hit the islands in the coming days. He said: On its current track, Jose is predicted to pass north of the Virgin Islands, possibly as a Category 3 hurricane on Saturday or Sunday. If it stays north of us we will not be significantly affected. But if it comes any closer to us we will be affected and so our preparation and response efforts have to be immediate. We need your cooperation and your support to ensure that we can ramp up our operations in the event that we are impacted again. Let us all continue to help each other however we can and continue to pray for each other. May God bless and protect the territory and our people.” Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte says the runway on St Maarten has been cleared and first aid flight has arrived. In a Facebook update he said there has been enormous destruction and upheaval on the Franco-Dutch island. “Many inhabitants are devoid of basic necessities,” Rutte said. He added: “We’ve been able to clear the runway at the airport and a first plane has landed. Our troops have been able to unload supplies at the port. We are now trying to get as much food, water and medicine as possible in the shortest possible time. We need to hurry because the next hurricane is coming. The latest reports are that hurricane José is less powerful and Sint Maarten and will pass further from the island. That is some good news in all the misery. But we are prepared for everything and will keep an eye on the situation. We won’t abandon St Maarten.” In a press conference Rutte is reported to have told reporters that there is “serious” problem with looting in the wake of the hurricane. The Dutch broadcaster RTL Nieuws has published video purporting to show looting in the wake of the storm. Here’s the slightly adjusted track and timings of impact from the latest update. Miami still lies directly in its path. Those in central Florida have been warned to expect category tow strength winds of up to 110mph at the weekend. Irma is still “extremely dangerous” but it has been downgraded from a category 5 to a category 4 hurricane with sustained windspeeds of 155mph. Here’s are the main points from the latest National Hurricane Center update: The Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas are warned of life-threatening winds and storm surges until Saturday. Hurricane conditions will also spread to parts of north Cuba. Severe hurricane conditions will hit Florida on Saturday night. A storm surge warning of “life threatening inundation” is place for the next 36 hours in Florida. The US states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina have been warned of “life-threatening flash floods and mudslides” from next Tuesday. While Irma has lost a little strength, two other Hurricanes in the region Katia and Jose have gained strength, according to the latest warnings from the National Hurricane Center. Irma is still packing devastating sustained wind speeds of 155 mph (down from 185mph). Close behind it is Hurricane Jose which has slightly increased power and now has sustained speeds of 125mph. At the weekend it is forecast to batter the same Leeward Islands that were hit by Hurricane Irma earlier this week. To the south-west in the Gulf of Mexico is Hurricane Katia which has increase sustained wind speeds to 90mp. Captain Stephen Russell, of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, has expressed fears for hundreds of people who ignored evacuation orders on islands in the archipelago. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said there were five islands that are likely to be worst hit by Irma: Great Inagua ( population 913); Mayaguana (277) Acklins (population 428); Crooked Islands (population 350); and Ragged Island (population 72). Irma was recorded barrelling over these islands within the last 90 minutes. All of the people on those islands were urged to leave as have the 600 people on the islands of Bimini, 50 miles to the east of the coast of Florida. Up to two-thirds of the people on those islands, have been flown to the capital Nassau, Russell said, including 400 people from the Bimini islands on Thursday. He said: “I fear for those person who chose not to evacuate from the islands. The government has made a very strong appeal to them. But some are simply stubborn. There is very little we can do to assistant until Monday or Tuesday. That is fear, that when we go into those areas we are going to find persons in serious distress and even fatalities.” He added: “Those who have stayed include troops, police officers and persons who just made up their mind that they are not going to leave their island. That is their choice. The government of the Bahamas made a strong appeal for all of them to leave the island but they made up their minds that they are going to ride out the storm in the islands.” Dutch troops have begun unloading aid on the Franco-Dutch island of St Martin/St Maarten. The French government has sent two ships to the area. The UK government has deployed RFA Mounts Bay to the area. HMS Ocean is also on the way, but will not reach the Caribbean for at least 10 days. A former official on the British dependency of Anguilla has an update on the carnage on the island left by Irma. The official, who does not want to be named, said the island high school has been destroyed; the public works building has collapsed and part of the roof of the main hospital is missing. “It is fair to call the situation devastating,” he said, “most roads remain blocked and power lines are down.” He added that power lines are down everywhere and that mobile phone connections are patchy at best. The UK government plans to deploy troops to the island after conceded that the situation there was worse than feared. Patrick Lynch of Roy’s Bayside Grill forwarded images of some of the damage to Anguilla. One of the humanitarian experts sent by the British government to the Caribbean has admitted that the UK has not done as much for its territories in the the region as the Dutch and French government have for theirs. Fergus Thomas is a member of two small humanitarian teams deployed to the Caribbean in the wake of Irma. He was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about criticism from Anguilla, one of the islands worst hit, that Britain had failed to follow the example of the Netherlands and France in preparing its dependencies for the impact of the hurricane. Thomas replied: “That’s a very fair comment. There is quite some justification in that, however we have had a navy vessel that has been sheltering just south of Puerto Rico and has now deployed, so within 24 hours we have managed to move some of our military assets to support the survivors and today they were in Anguilla.” He admitted UK humanitarian teams had yet to reach the worst hit areas. He said: “We haven’t got onto the ground on the islands that have been worst hit. Some of our military colleagues have got out today and started doing the first assistance.” But he said it was unfair to criticise the UK military for its response. “They moved us as soon as soon as they could to the islands that have been worst hit. I would question the criticism that they [the British military] haven’t been timely. They are the first responders in Anguilla. They are moving now to the British Virgin Islands, which as far as we now have been majorly catastrophically hit.” On Thursday foreign office minister Alan Duncan defended the UK government’s response by pointed out that the UK does not directly govern its islands in the Caribbean. He told the Commons: “The relationship between overseas territories and their parent countries differs. Whilst French territories are directly governed, that is not the case with our overseas territories. While this means our responses will, of course, be different, we will seek to achieve the same objectives and are taking immediate steps to do so.” Hurricane Irma remains a category 5 hurricane, with slightly decreased wind speeds of 160mph (260kph), currently swiping Great Inagua island at the southernmost tip of the Bahamas. Captain Stephen Russell, of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, said rising tide levels could be life-threatening: The destructive force of a 25ft surge: that is our greatest concern. It can really cause catastrophic results From there, Irma is set to scrape the north of Cuba before heading to southern Florida and the Florida Keys, where a full-scale hurricane warning is in place and mass evacuations have been ordered before expected landfall on Saturday. Cuba is evacuating tourists from coastal resorts and warning residents to move inland. On Thursday night Irma crossed north of Haiti, causing less damage than had been feared in the beleaguered country. There were reports of some injuries and damage to buildings, but not widespread devastation. The hurricane also pummelled the Turks and Caicos Islands, where power failed and the governor, John Freeman, warned residents: Hunker down, stay where you are … Nobody can get to you – people are, for a little while, on their own. Across the Caribbean, at least 13 people are confirmed to have died in the storm: an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, four in the US Virgin Islands, and four in the French territory of St Martin. Lonnie Soury, a spokesman for the US Virgin Islands, said the toll was expected to rise. The UK, France and the Netherlands have mobilised personnel and aid for their overseas territories that were caught in the onslaught. After complaints that the British government’s response has been slow, ministers authorised £32m in emergency aid and dispatched a military task group. HMS Ocean – currently in the Mediterranean – will be deployed but will take 10-14 days to reach the Caribbean. A voluntary evacuation began from the tiny island of Barbuda – where upwards of 90% of homes were destroyed – to its larger sister island of Antigua, with the prospect of Hurricane Jose, a category 3 storm, striking this weekend. From its current havoc in the Bahamas, Hurricane Irma is set to move across northern Cuba before hitting southern Florida and making its way up the state. Governor Rick Scott has warned that the storm will be “bigger than our entire state” – as forecast images confirm: Irma has now whipped a path from Barbuda in the east to, currently, the Bahamas, with the north of Cuba and then Florida still in its sights. We have been monitoring the effects of the category 5 storm on each island, as reports come in of casualties and damage: On an official visit to Greece, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was repeatedly forced to defend his decision to defer a trip to St Martin and other islands devastated by the storm. Addressing reporters in Athens where he was conducting his first overseas visit, the French leader said he had decided to go ahead with the two-day trip to Greece, rather than attempt to head to the Caribbean, because prevailing weather conditions would not have permitted him to fly to French territories hit by Hurricane Irma. “As soon as the weather allows I will go,” he said, adding that he was being constantly updated and the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, was following developments closely. Macron said he had left for Greece after an emergency government meeting in Paris. The latest advisory from the US National Hurricane Center confirms Irma is passing north of the Bahamas’ Great Inagua island, with wind speeds now of 160mph (260kph) – down from its 185mph peak but still a category five hurricane. Hurricane warnings remain in effect for: South-eastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands Central and north-western Bahamas Haiti from the northern border with the Dominican Republic to Le Mole St Nicholas Cuban provinces of Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, and Villa Clara Jupiter Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Bonita Beach Florida Keys Lake Okeechobee Florida Bay Irma is now into the Bahamas archipelago, passing just north of Great Inagua island at the southernmost tip. Meanwhile – in unconnected news – an earthquake of magnitude 8 has struck off the southern coast of Mexico, prompting a series of possible tsunami warnings. Read more here: The ongoing effects of Irma – as well as lack of power and communications – are hampering reports from the islands it has already passed over. Press Association has this from the British Virgin Islands: Houses were reduced to foundations following the devastating storm. Images posted on social media showed entire structures razed to the ground, with debris scattered across the streets. Sharon Flax-Brutus, director of tourism for the group of more than 60 islands, said: The destruction caused by Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands has been devastating. The destination has lost entire structures and many homes are without roofs, or have been diminished to merely foundations.” She added communication between the islands has been difficult as mobile phone towers had come down – meaning it was tricky to gauge the full extent of the damage. The eye of the storm is moving on to the southern Bahamas. The US National Hurricane Center warned that storm surges could lift water levels in south-eastern and central Bahamas by 15-20ft (4.5-6m) above normal levels. Bahamas prime minister Hubert Minnis said his government had evacuated people from six islands in the south to the capital, Nassau, in the largest storm evacuation in the country’s history. Airports have been closed. A hurricane warning is in place in Cuba, where tourists are being evacuated and residents of coastal towns told to move inland. By late Saturday, Irma is forecast to hit Florida, where mandatory evacuation orders have already been issued for Florida Keys and swaths of southern and coastal Florida. All hospitals in the Florida Keys archipelago will close at 7am Friday, and coast guard and rescue services have left. Guylee Simmonds, a volunteer with British charity Hope Health Action, is in Haiti, in the northern city of Cap-Haïtien, which on Thursday night bore the brunt of Irma’s outer fringes, and where at least two people have been reported injured. He says the outcome has been better than most people feared, a relief for a country that has “had some pretty bad luck”: It’s rained for most of the last 12 hours, but it does look like we haven’t sustained a particularly major hit. There have been some fairly high wind speeds and heavy rain, but it has not reached the severity we had been expecting. But there’s going to be ongoing bad weather for a couple of days I expect, and in Haiti a lot of the poorest communities here are at high risk of flooding. It’s incredibly fortunate that the storm has passed a bit further north. Our thoughts are with Turks and Caicos. He said the hospital he worked at was preparing to see an influx of patients once the scale of damage became clear: We were operating with skeleton staff. We reduced our outpatient care in the leadup to the storm, but our inpatient care remained. We were already close to capacity. I expect outpatient care won’t resume until the following day as we assess any damage done. I expect people with worse constructed homes will have sustained more damage. We’ll see what daylight brings. Irma was the first time the Turks and Caicos islands had experienced a category 5 hurricane. Ahead of its arrival, Virginia Clerveaux, director of disaster management and emergencies for the island group, warned: We are expecting inundation from both rainfall as well as storm surge. And we may not be able to come rescue [people] in a timely manner. The few tourists who remained on the Turks and Caicos islands were in hotels, as were some locals, Reuters reports. A Reuters witness described the roof and walls of a well-built house shaking hard as the screaming storm rocked the island of Providenciales and caused a drop in pressure that could be felt in people’s chests. Among the properties forced to evacuate in Florida is President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, the Miami Herald reports: President Donald Trump’s seaside Mar-a-Lago resort has been ordered to evacuate because of Hurricane Irma, along with the barrier islands and low-lying areas of Palm Beach County. Trump has returned repeatedly to the private club – which he bought in 1985 – to relax and conduct state business since becoming president. Mar-a-Lago, which overlooks the ocean on Palm Beach, was built in 1927. Summer is the slow tourist season in South Florida. Trump also owns three golf courses in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, as well as an 11-bedroom mansion on the French side of the Caribbean island of St Martin. Irma is about to make first contact with the Bahamas – specifically, Little Inagua (fortunately uninhabited) at the southernmost tip of the archipelago: Florida is locking down, Associated Press reports: Nasa secured Kennedy Space Center and SpaceX launched an unmanned rocket for an experimental flight. Kennedy closed its doors to all nonessential staff and a crew of about 120 people will ride out the storm on site. Most of the critical buildings at Kennedy are designed to withstand gusts of up to 135mph (220kph). Irma’s wind could exceed that if it reaches Cape Canaveral. Hurricane Jose is making its way towards Caribbean islands already battered by Irma. The US National Hurricane Center says Jose – a category 3 hurricane – “is expected to be near the northern Leeward Islands on Saturday”. This covers Barbuda, Antigua and Anguilla, the islands first hit by Irma. The Miami weather service has warned people in south Florida to make urgent plans to seek safety, saying: This is a potentially deadly situation! Residents and visitors must now implement emergency safety plans. Preparations to protect life and property should be completed by Friday night. Take final shelter by early Saturday morning. The US National Hurricane Center says the following locations are now subject to official hurricane warnings: Jupiter Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Bonita Beach Florida Keys Lake Okeechobee Florida Bay Haiti from the northern border with the Dominican Republic to Le Mole St Nicholas South-eastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands Cuban provinces of Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, and Villa Clara Central Bahamas North-western Bahamas Hurricane Irma breaks yet another record – now the longest lasting Atlantic storm this year: Irma is currently over the Turks and Caicos Islands, moving westwards towards the south-eastern Bahamas throughout Thursday night. The hurricane will then track between the Bahamas and northern Cuba before hitting southern Florida. This latest forecast says “severe hurricane conditions” are now expected to begin to hit the Florida peninsula and Florida Keys late on Saturday. Storm surges and high winds are expected to hit the southern part of the state. The advice from the US National Hurricane Center has moved Florida into the official hurricane warning group for the first time. The areas covered by the warnings cover south Florida and the Florida Keys. As the NHC explains: A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. This is a life-threatening situation. Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions. Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. The latest update from the US National Hurricane Center issues upgraded warnings for South Florida and the Florida Keys: A hurricane warning has been issued from Jupiter Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Bonita Beach, as well as for the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee, and Florida Bay. A storm surge warning has been issued from Jupiter Inlet southward around the Florida peninsula to Bonita Beach, as well as for the Florida Keys. “We had cars flying over our head, we had 40ft containers flying left and right,” said Knacyntar Nedd, chairwoman of the Barbuda council. “People were literally tying themselves to roofs with ropes to hold them down.” “What we experienced is like something you see in a horror movie, not something you expect to actually happen in reality,” Nedd told the local ABS television. Among the most traumatised survivors were those who tried to ride Irma out at home. “When the first part came, it was like the whole house was ripping apart,” said Jacqueline Bisa, who was in her home with seven relatives. They took shelter in a closet and the bathroom but the winds were so fierce they had to hang on to the door to keep it closed until they could be evacuated. “It was like it was sucking us up,” she said the next morning. Several older residents with long experience of the fierce winds churned up by the Atlantic in hurricane season described Irma as unprecedented. “Last night was the most devastating experience I have had in my life and I am almost 60,” said a man who gave his name as King Goldilocks. “Who hasn’t lost their roof, their house crumbled, like me? I am totally homeless.” As well as winds of 185mph (295kph), Irma also dumped 11 inches (28cm) of rain on parts of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as it passed: Cuba is evacuating tourists as Irma approaches, Reuters reports: Cuba started evacuating some of the 51,000 tourists visiting the island, particularly 36,000 people at resorts on the picturesque northern coast. That included all Canadian tourists, who Cuban tourism minister Manuel Marrero estimated made up 60% of foreign visitors in the country’s keys. In Caibarien, a coastal town in the hurricane’s predicted path, residents piled mattresses and a television in a car to get farther inland. “The roof here is rotten so it will just fly away. Everything will get ruined if we leave it here,” said Miriam Faife. “I’m scared.” Haiti has felt the edges of Hurricane Irma as it careered away from the Dominican Republic towards the Turks and Caicos Islands, and reports so far suggest it has been spared the worst effects of the category 5. But the north of Haiti, including the port city of Cap-Haïtien, have experienced heavy rainfall and strong winds from Irma’s outer fringes as it passed. There are reports of buildings damaged and trees felled. Two people were reportedly injured in Cap-Haïtien when a tree crashed into their home. And a bridge linking the Dominican Republic to Haiti has collapsed. Captain Stephen Russell, of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, has told CNN of the approaching hurricane: We are prepared as best as we can be. He says some people are in shelters, but most who were evacuated from southern islands have sought refuge with family members and friends. We are urging all persons throughout the Bahamas – whether they are visitors, residents, in the Bahamas at this time – to find a way to safeguard themselves from the impact of Hurricane Irma … Find a safe place, a safe shelter. He says people in low-lying areas should seek to move to higher ground, away from the coast into the interior. He says a storm surge of up to 25ft (7.6m) could be witnessed. The destructive force of a 25ft surge: that is our greatest concern. It can really cause catastrophic results Turks and Caicos is currently suffering Irma’s attack. Virginia Clerveaux, director of the Turks and Caicos department of disaster management and emergencies, told the BBC that people had been asked to find safe shelter: We are now trying to remind them that this is a category five, and in the history of the Turks and Caicos islands this is the largest storm we have ever been impacted or threatened by. The highest point on the islands is only 163ft (50m) and the US National Hurricane Center has warned that Irma could bring waves of 15-20 feet (4.5-6 metres) above normal levels. Irma continues its sobering record-breaking streak: with sustained wind speeds of 185mph (295kph) for 33 hours, it is the longest storm of such intensity since satellite monitoring began in the 1970s. Wind speeds have now dipped slightly to 175mph over the Turks and Caicos Islands, still a category 5 hurricane. The five living former US presidents – Barack Obama, the two George Bushes, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter – have launched a fundraising drive, the One America appeal. Originally conceived to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, the appeal will now be expanded to aid Americans affected by Hurricane Irma, the donations website says. Irma remains a category five hurricane with wind speeds of 175mph (280kph) – slightly down from its peak of 185mph – as it batters the Turks and Caicos Islands. This image shows the eye of Irma as it passes right over the islands: And this shows the intensity as Irma passed across Anguilla, St Martin, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before heading to Turks and Caicos: Florida governor Rick Scott has ordered all state offices, schools, colleges and universities to close from Friday until at least Monday “to ensure we have every space available for sheltering and staging”. Scott added: Every family must be prepared to evacuate. A voluntary evacuation began on Thursday from the tiny island of Barbuda – where upwards of 90% of homes were destroyed – to its larger sister island of Antigua. Barbuda also faces the prospect of Hurricane Jose, currently a category 3 storm, striking this weekend. Website 365Antigua says supplies are needed for evacuees arriving from Barbuda, including for several babies who are expected on a boat in around an hour from now: 25 babies will be coming in from Barbuda on the 10pm boat. All items such as formula, bottles, diapers, blankets, wipes will be needed. Please bring these items to multi-purpose center, St John’s, Antigua. Concerning news from Florida, via Associated Press: As Hurricane Irma threatens to pound Miami with winds of mind-boggling power, a heavyweight hazard looms over the city’s skyline: two dozen enormous construction cranes. Because those cranes were not designed to withstand a storm of Irma’s ferocity, city officials are telling people who live in the shadows of the giant devices to leave. Construction sites across Irma’s potential path in Florida are being locked down to prevent building materials, tools and debris from becoming flying missiles in hurricane winds. The horizontal arms of the tall tower cranes, however, will remain loose despite the potential danger of collapse. City officials say they cannot be tied down or moved. Miami officials say it would take two weeks to move the cranes. The counterbalance on tower cranes weigh up to 30,000lb (13,600kg). A government spokesman has said four people are now known to have been killed by Hurricane Irma in the US Virgin Islands, taking the total confirmed across the Caribbean so far to at least 13. USVI spokesman Lonnie Soury said the death toll could rise: We are not sanguine that there aren’t more. Other confirmed fatalities include an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico and four in the French territory of St Martin. John Freeman, the governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, has been speaking to CNN as Hurricane Irma reaches the islands. Freeman says the message to people there is: Hunker down, stay where you are … Nobody can get to you either – people are, for a little while, on their own. He says authorities took steps before the storms came, moving some people to shelters, and bringing heavily pregnant women and dialysis patients into hospitals. Power is out, he says: Water production goes down, of course, with the electricity. On Grand Turk, the water went down quite early because the electricity went down quite early. But, Freeman adds, “people here have been used to hurricanes” and have been collecting water before the winds hit. The US National Hurricane Center has issued an update on Irma’s progress. Here are the key points: Irma is currently hitting the Turks and Caicos Islands The hurricane is currently 55 miles (85km) west-south-west of Grand Turk, with maximum sustained winds of 175mph (280kmh). Hurricane warnings remain in place for Turks and Caicos, Haiti, south-eastern, central and north-western Bahamas, western parts of the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. A hurricane warning means “preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion” in those areas as hurricane conditions are expected. Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rosselló has also declared a disaster in the tiny islands of Culebra and Vieques, to Puerto Rico’s east, which were hard-hit by the storm. So far there has been little information from the islands about the extent of the damage there. Even as Irma continues to wreak havoc across the Caribbean, attention turns to recovery for those islands already hit. Many affected islands have links with the UK, France, US and the Netherlands, and those countries have mobilised – some less speedily than others – to engage in relief efforts. The French interior minister, Gerard Collomb, said the country had sent 100,000 food rations – four days of supplies – to its overseas collectivities of St Martin and Saint Barthélemy: It’s a tragedy. We’ll need to rebuild both islands. Most of the schools have been destroyed. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said the storm had “caused wide-scale destruction of infrastructure, houses and businesses” on St Maarten, the Netherlands-administered part of St Martin: There is no power, no gasoline, no running water. Houses are under water, cars are floating through the streets, inhabitants are sitting in the dark in ruined houses and are cut off from the outside world. The US military is sending troops to the US Virgin Islands, where governor Kenneth Mapp described the situation as “very chilling”. Britain said it was sending troops and the HMS Ocean – currently in the Mediterranean – to Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands. Irma now has Haiti in its sights. Authorities there have admitted they are ill-prepared for the category five onslaught, with the risks of flash flooding and landslides high. Heavy rain is already pummelling the north coast and several areas have already lost power. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog. In the British Virgin Islands, governor Gus Jaspert has declared a state of emergency in the wake of Irma – and with Hurricane Jose threatening to reach them this weekend. Jaspert asked people on the BVI to avoid using roads unless “absolutely necessary” in order to prioritise emergency services. He added: I would like to appeal to you to remain calm and to reassure we are doing all we can to assist you. Please, could any public service organisation or anyone with a truck that could offer assistance and have not made contact with the [national emergency operations centre], do so now. Let us all continue to help each other however we can and continue to pray for each other, may God bless and protect the territory and our people. The eye of Hurricane Irma, still a category 5 storm with sustained winds of 175mph (290kph), has moved westward off the northern coast of Hispaniola, its arms raking across Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm is currently bearing down on the British territories of Turks and Caicos, and projected to move toward the southern Bahamas. At least 12 people have been confirmed dead in the wake of the storm. The confirmed fatalities include an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, three in the US Virgin Islands, and four in the French territory of St Martin. Thousands more remain in shelters, their homes damaged or destroyed. In Puerto Rico, almost a million people are without power and 50,000 without water, according to the US territory’s department of emergency relief. South Florida was placed on watch, with more than 750,000 people ordered to evacuate barrier islands and coastal areas. The NWS warned that storm surges of five to 10ft (up to 3 metres) could begin in the next 48 hours. Governor Rick Scott said that a storm surge moved by a storm this strong “could cover your house”, and pleaded with residents not to underestimate the hurricane. More than 500,000 people were ordered to evacuate from coastal Georgia. “Every Florida family must be prepared to evacuate regardless of the coast you live on,” Scott said, stressing the gigantic scale of the storm. “We can rebuild your home but we cannot rebuild your life.” The storm is expected to descend somewhere on the Florida coast on Friday night or early Saturday, though it remains unclear where or when exactly the hurricane will fall the mainland. The Keys will have no rescue services or hospitals from Friday morning onward, authorities warned. The National Weather Service warned residents that winds and floods could make buildings “uninhabitable for weeks or months”, and authorities raced to bring fuel to areas with shortages. On Barbuda, prime minister Gaston Browne said Irma had made 90% of the tiny island’s structures “literally rubble” and that half the population was homeless. On French-administered St Martin, local councilman Daniel Gibbs told a local radio station “95% of the island is destroyed”. French authorities have sent naval ships with supplies to the island, and the UK has sent a vessel with supplies to its Virgin Islands territories. In Haiti and the Dominican Republican, authorities closed all schools. Haitian president Jovenal Moïse urged people in rural areas to head to shelters and out of the mountains. On the Bahamas, prime minister Hubert Minnis ordered people to leave six southern islands, the largest evacuation in the country’s history. East of the Caribbean, hurricane Jose grew to a category three storm, on course to strike some of the small islands that have barely emerged from Irma’s winds. The governor of Puerto Rico is meeting with residents and surveying the damage, writing on Twitter: “our people of Culbera and their city government can count on the support and attention of the central government for their recovery.” And in Dominican Republic, United Nations staff begin to take stock of what’s left from Irma’s recent departure. Northbound routes out of Florida have become jammed with traffic, as more than half a million people flee southern evacuation zones of the state and airports prepare for their final flights before closing on Friday. Hundreds of thousands more were ordered to evacuate coastal areas of Georgia, as the state’s governor prepared for worst-case scenarios. The AP reports from I-95 and I-75, the largest roads leading north out of Florida and Georgia. Mari and Neal Michaud loaded their two children and dog into their small sport-utility vehicle and left their home near Cocoa Beach about 10am, bound for an impromptu vacation in Washington, D.C. Using a phone app and calls to search for fuel along the way, they finally arrived at a convenience store that had gasoline nearly five hours later. The 60-mile trip up Interstate 95 should have taken an hour, said Mari Michaud. “There was no gas and it’s gridlock. People are stranded on the sides of the highway,” she said. “It’s 92 degrees out and little kids are out on the grass on the side of the road. No one can help them.” Noel Marsden said he, his girlfriend, her son and their dog left Pembroke Pines north of Miami with plans to ride out Irma in Savannah, only to find the city was also shutting down because of Irma. Marsden isn’t sure where they’ll all end up. “I’ve got a buddy in Atlanta and a buddy in Charlotte. We’ll wind up one of those two places because there are not hotels, I can tell you that,” he said. The last time Georgia was struck by a hurricane of force Category 3 or higher happened in 1898. The last Category 5 storm to hit Florida was Andrew in 1992. Its winds topped 165 mph (265 kph), killing 65 people and inflicting $26 billion in damage. It was at the time the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history. The Associated Press reports that three people have died in the US Virgin Islands, according to American officials there. Governor spokesman Samuel Topp said Thursday that the deaths occurred in the St. Thomas and St. Johns district. Officials say crews are clearing many roads that remain inaccessible. The category storm destroyed homes, schools and roads as it roared through the northeast Caribbean this week and heads toward Florida. Nine other people were confirmed killed by the storm around the Caribbean: an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, and four in the French territory of St Martin. France’s interior minister at first said eight people had been killed, but the nation’s prime minister later said he could only confirm four killed. Officials said they expect the toll to increase as search and rescue efforts begin. More than 250,000 people have been ordered to evacuate from parts of Palm Beach County, officials said, effective Friday morning at 10am local time. The areas include barrier islands, areas near Jupiter, mobile homes, and low coastal areas and neighborhoods and towns along the intracostal waterways running up and down the coast. The storm surge, in particular, will be unusually large and dangerous. “It’s not something that we’ve seen in our lifetime. The strength of this storm is remarkable and it’s not remarkable in a good way,” a local official says at a press briefing.” County officials are urging people who are not in evacuation zones to have battery-powered lights, extra charges for cell phones, bottled water, and sealed food, among other supplies. “It may be days before public assistance can get to you,” the official says. He adds that there are four general population shelters opening in the county on Friday at 3pm local time. “The message from the state, from the governor, is that there are a lot of people on the highway, a lot of people trying to get some place, and the roads are not able to handle that.” American forecasters have just updated their projections for Irma with an ominous tack west, toward Miami-Dade County – the most populous county in Florida – and a path through the center of the state. The National Weather Service has upgrade hurricane Jose, currently east of the Caribbean and heading toward the same islands just struck by Irma, to a category three storm, with additional growth possible in the next 24 to 36 hours. Hurricane watches are in effect for Antigua and Barbuda, and tropical storm watches for Anguilla, Montserrat, St Kitts, and Nevis – islands that all either suffered brutal storms or narrowly avoided devastation from Irma. As recovery workers reach St Maarten, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Irma, so do photographers, conveying the scope of the storm. Though a northward swerve appears increasingly unlikely for hurricane Irma before landfall on Florida, Georgia governor Nathan Deal has ordered mandatory evacuations from coastal areas of his state. Like his colleagues in Florida, Deal appears to be taking no chances with Irma’s general northern trajectory, ordering people to prepare and leave the area sooner rather than later. The state’s emergency services have provided maps and more detail about the areas affected by the order. Time is running out for flights departing from southern Florida. Fort Lauderdale airport, which is with Miami International one of the major hubs of south Florida, will close its doors on Friday evening. Miami International has not yet said when its last flight will depart before the storm, but warned people that it should not be considered a haven from the hurricane. “The airport is not a designated shelter during a storm, and operational needs at MIA may require occupants to be evacuated to nearby shelters. Resources like food and water may also not be readily available in the airport during or after the storm.” Eric Blake, a National Hurricane Center scientist, has described Irma in stark, dire terms, urging people to listen to emergency managers and do everything possible to protect themselves and loved ones. “This hurricane is as serious as any I have seen. No hype, just the hard facts. Take every life saving precaution you can,” Blake tweeted. “I have little doubt #Irma will go down as one of the most infamous in Atlantic hurricane history.” “Trust the NHC professionals for the best possible forecast. Protect you and your loved ones. I hope I have a house to return to. I know it sounds dire. But a Category 4/5 into South Florida is one of those scenarios that sends chills.” In Samana, in the eastern Dominican Republic, the United Nations Development Programme is among the international effort to send experts to help recovery. Alejandro Adames, a photographer with the organization, has sent along photos of some of the destruction: structures sliding into the sea, a road with a cavernous space eroded beneath it, downed wires and trees. Irma is moving north of Hispanolia, on course between the island and the British territories of Turks and Caicos, heading toward the southern Bahamas. Beth Carroll, a coordinator with the Catholic Relief Services, is in Haiti on the other side of the island, which has suffered raking winds from the titanic hurricane. “Poor drainage in the low-lying northern coastal areas mean that even a small amount of rain can cause extensive flooding,” she said. “The rain and winds expected from Irma, which promises to be a monster of a storm, will potentially cause catastrophic flooding and landslides. That’s why we are so concerned now.” Florida governor Rick Scott has stressed time and again the frustrating, dangerous unpredictability of hurricanes, noting that a sudden swerve remains entirely possible and could either spare the state or exacerbate a collision. The Washington Post has compiled a list of some possible courses – with many caveats – excerpted here: Scathing winds but landfall averted: “In this scenario, Miami would be spared the dangerous right-hand side of the storm. Hurricanes are most dangerous to the right of their center, since their rotating winds couple with the storm’s forward motion, making the gusts inside that much stronger. If the center tracks just offshore, Miami would would still contend with serious storm conditions with winds sustained between 55-75mph and gusts to 90, along with 4 to 7 inches of rain. This would occur in the Saturday-Sunday timeframe. While the storm’s the western eyewall would pass just offshore of Miami in this scenario, storms of Irma’s intensity are subject to “trochoidal wobbles.” Think of a hurricane like a spinning top; because the top rotates so quickly, it way jog left or right a little bit as it treks along while rotating furiously. Irma is the same way. A wobble of just a few miles west or east as she passes Miami could thrust the city into extreme danger, so this is a high-stakes forecast.” Landfall near Miami: “Some models turn the hurricane northward late enough that it cannot avoid slamming into Southeast Florida. In this scenario, the system may make landfall in Southern Florida as a major hurricane of at least Category 4 strength. A large-scale disaster would likely result. Major population centers, like Miami, would be exposed to the destructive winds of the hurricane eyewall, in which gusts may exceed 140mph. A catastrophic storm surge would sweep ashore, while devastating inland flooding would result from excessive rainfall.” Northward through Florida: “In this scenario, Irma would move ashore somewhere between the Keys and Miami. All of Florida would see wind and rain, but the heaviest would be relegated to areas south of Route 75, including the Everglades, Homestead, and Key Biscayne. The worst conditions would sweep ashore to the right side of the eye, exposing the Miami metro area to extreme hurricane-force winds, a surge of at least several feet, and torrential downpours.” A veer west: “A few model outliers hang on to the possibility that the storm rides up the west coast of Florida, then Key West, Naples, Fort Myers, Tampa, and Tallahassee would face the brunt of the storm – similar to Scenario 2 for southeast and eastern Florida. The most destructive winds and devastating storm surge would occur in Southwest Florida, assuming that’s where the center first came ashore.” Florida governor Rick Scott has again urged people up and down his state to prepare for worst case scenarios of the hurricane. He notes that Floridians can go to JaxReady.com for more information, or the state’s Department of Emergency Management. If people are in need of hotels, he says Expedia is offering Florida-specific service, that JetBlue has capped flights out of Florida at $99, and that the app GasBuddy can help guide residents toward fuel. He again urges people to know their evacuation zone, and to act immediately if they are in a mandatory area. Another official warns that if the storm stays on its current path, mandatory evacuation zones will expand, and more people will need to head north or to inland shelters. Scott says that the extraordinarily powerful winds of the storm mean it will not likely deluge Florida, like hurricane Harvey did to Texas. But it will “My biggest concern right now is that people are not taking seriously enough the risk of storm surge,” Scott says. “A storm surge, we could have five to 10 feet of storm surge, it could cover your house.” He also reiterates a warning about the unpredictable nature of the storm, that it could move east or west at a surprising moment: “this storm has the potential to catastrophically devastate our state, and you have to take this seriously.” “It’s already killed a lot of people in the Caribbean, don’t think you can ride out this storm,” Scott says. “I cannot stress this enough: get prepared now.” Finally, Scott pleads for more volunteers to help with shelters, food distribution, and other response efforts, saying the state needs 17,000 people in all to help. Volunteers can call 1.800.FLHELP1, he says. Florida senator Marco Rubio has urged residents to act now, in the final hours before Irma makes landfall on the American mainland, most likely on the southern coast of his state. Governor Rick Scott is giving an afternoon press conference with the latest information on preparations, which we’ll have updates from shortly. Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade, has expanded evacuation orders to more coastal and increasingly inland regions. The county had already ordered evacuations in Miami Beach and other barrier islands (Zone A and parts of Zone B); Gimenez has now ordered evacuations for Miami’s main financial and downtown condo districts (the rest of Zone B) and inland districts like South Miami and Coral Gables (Zone C). The orders affect more than 500,000 people. The Miami Herald has more details on the orders, and Gimenez has urged residents to look at MiamiDade.gov for more information. As hurricane Irma barrels through the Caribbean on its course toward the mainland United States, people who have survived its passage or are still preparing for it have captured stunning, surreal images of the storm: boats stacked atop each other in the Virgin Islands, swelling turbid floods in Puerto Rico, Mustangs driving off to homemade barricades in Florida. Donald Trump has declared a disaster for the US Virgin Islands, according to Thomas Bossert, a national security adviser to the president, and the UK has sent a military task for to its adjacent territories along with millions of pounds Britain has released £32m in emergency aid for its territories, as well as the ship HMS Ocean, carrying at least three helicopters, and hundreds of marines and royal engineers who will be sent in RAF transport planes. The trip ship will take 10 days to two weeks to reach the islands from the Mediterranean. The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reports: The increased resources, and military hardware, came after an overnight assessment sent to the cabinet emergency committee Cobra concluded the devastation on the British overseas territories of Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands was worse than feared. Aid was increased from a planned £12m to £32m after Cobra met. At least one person has been confirmed dead in Anguilla and there are concerns that another British overseas territory – the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands – is in the line of the storm and likely to be battered. Evacuations have begun and tropical-force rains were expected to begin on Thursday afternoon local time. Philip Levine, the mayor of Miami Beach, has told CNN that Irma is “a nuclear hurricane” and that all residents and visitors to the area should leave. “This is a very serious, incredibly powerful storm. I call it a nuclear hurricane,” Levine said. “I recommend and strongly urge all our residents and visitors to leave Miami Beach. I’m aggressively going out there telling everyone get out of Miami Beach.” Levine said that buses and city trolleys are working to get people off the barrier of Miami Beach and inland, toward shelters around Miami-Dade county. He warned people that first responders will be working to save people after the worst of the storm, but will be unable to help people in the most dangerous areas – such as Miami Beach and the Florida Keys – once the storm has reached them. “When that storm hits we’re not going to put the lives of our first responders in jeopardy,” Levine said. “We don’t want heroes. This isn’t about devastation, it’s about evacuation.” He added that although most of the city’s buildings built after hurricane Andrew, a devastating category five storm that hit Florida in 1992, are built to withstand such storms, people should take no chances. “I wouldn’t trust any building code, any building promise,” the mayor said. “I never thought I’d say this but leave Miami Beach, get out of Miami Beach.’ Little has changed with Irma’s trajectory with the 2pm eastern update, meaning huge consequences for millions of people in Florida are dependent on tiny, last minute changes in the course of the hurricane, notes meteorologist Ryan Maue. Farther east in the Atlantic, hurricane Jose has grown to a category two storm, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph. Hurricane Irma has left Puerto Rico with at least three dead and thousands more without power or water, but the island’s residents and government have allowed themselves a sigh of relief that the storm did not move slightly south, wreaking the same devastation as other islands more directly in its path. Reuters reports from San Juan, where street signs, powerlines, and trees have fallen across the roads and onto buildings. The storm’s eye did not come ashore in Puerto Rico but roared past with 185mph winds and hammered the coast with 30ft waves.“It was really not as bad as we had feared,” said Omar Alvarez, 53, a real state appraiser. “We had very high winds but we got lucky.” “It was mostly wind, not water. In Hugo, the water came up to here,” he said, referring to the 1989 hurricane that had flooded his street just three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. Governor Ricardo Rossello warned the storm was expected to continue to drop rain on the island’s western side, raising the risk of landslides. Rescuers still were working in the island’s northeast, raising the possibility that more bodies could be discovered. Some 6,300 people and 500 pets remained in shelters in the storm’s wake early Thursday. “The Harvey experience had an effect of people,” lawyer Nereida Melendez, 59, said as she walked along a beach-side road covered in sand and palm leaves. “It just showed them what can happen. It made them take it more seriously.” “Mostly what has happened here is that there is no electricity and a lot of trees are down,” said Rafael Ojeda, a 49-year-old lawyer. “Let’s see how fast the electricity comes back up.” The storm came at a bad time for Puerto Rico, which is in the midst of trying to restructure some $70 billion in debts. Ojeda worried that and the demand for quick repairs to the power grid could lead to longer-term problems. “The infrastructure is old and if you’re going to just patch it up and not fix it, the next time it is going to go,” he said. The eye of Hurricane Irma, still a category 5 storm with sustained winds of 180mph (290kph), moved westward off the northern coast of Hispaniola on Thursday morning, its winds raking the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm’s projected path Thursday brings it almost directly over the British possessions of Turks and Caicos, followed by a course near the southern Bahamas. At least nine people have been confirmed dead in the wake of the storm, and as many as 13 reported killed. The confirmed fatalities include an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla, three people in Puerto Rico, and four in the French territory of St Martin. Thousands more remain in shelters, their homes damaged or destroyed. In Puerto Rico, almost a million people are without power and 50,000 without water, according to the US territory’s department of emergency relief. Southern Florida was placed on hurricane watch, with warnings that storm surges of five to 10ft could begin in the next 48 hours. The National Weather Service warned residents that winds and floods could make buildings “uninhabitable for weeks or months”, and authorities raced to bring fuel to areas with shortages. “Every Florida family must be prepared to evacuate regardless of the coast you live on,” governor Rick Scott said, stressing the gigantic scale of the storm. “We can rebuild your home but we cannot rebuild your life.” The storm is expected to hit the Florida Keys on Friday night and make landfall on the mainland early Saturday, though it remains unclear where exactly the hurricane will hit the mainland. The Keys will have no rescue services or hospitals from Friday onward, authorities warned. On Barbuda, prime minister Gaston Browne said Irma had made 90% of the tiny island’s structures “literally rubble” and that half the population was homeless. On French-administered St Martin, local councilman Daniel Gibbs told a local radio station “95% of the island is destroyed”. French authorities have sent naval ships with supplies to the island. In Haiti and the Dominican Republican, authorities closed all schools. Haitian president Jovenal Moïse urged people in rural areas to head to shelters and out of the mountains. “The hurricane is not a game,” he said in a television address. On the Bahamas, prime minister Hubert Minnis ordered people to leave six southern islands, the largest evacuation in the country’s history. Already one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, Irma held sustained winds of 185mph for over 24 hours before it slowed to its current speed, making it the most enduring hurricane since the 1960s when satellite monitoring began. President Donald Trump has declared states of emergency in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida. The Miami station of the National Weather Station has issued a dire warning for the potential effects of the storm on southern Florida, in particular tornado-force winds and huge storm surges. The main window of concern for hurricane Irma, impacts is early Saturday morning through Monday. Additional concerns exist for flooding rains, isolated tornadoes, significant beach erosion and surf, coastal flooding, and life-threatening rip currents. Florida residents should be prepared for the possibility that homes and buildings may be entirely “uninhabitable for weeks or months”, the station warned. Wind: prepare for life-threatening wind having possible devastating impacts across south Florida. Potential impacts include: Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof adn wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airbone projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and roadway signs blown over. Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable. Widespread power communications outages. Surge: prepare for life-threatening surge having possible devastating impacts across coastal Collier, mainland Monroe, coastal Miami-Dade counties, including Biscayne Bay. Donald Trump has said he believes the United States is ready for hurricane Irma, telling reporters, “we think we are as well prepare as we could possibly be.” Yet he still admitted uncertainty about what will actually happening, as he did on Wednesday, by saying Irma “looks like it could be something that will be not good, believe me, not good.” On Thursday, he said: “Florida is as well prepared as you can be for something like this and we’ll see what happens. Certainly we are being hit with a lot of hurricanes.” The president also spoke about the recovery from hurricane Harvey, praising the efforts of the coast guard for saving thousands of lives. “What could have been a total catastrophe,” he said, “in terms of lives has been much less.” French officials have cast doubt on the number of fatalities on the territory of St Martin, saying they have confirmed four deaths but not the eight reported by local officials previously. The AFP reports: French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday that four people were confirmed dead on the Caribbean island of St Martin ravaged by Hurricane Irma. Local rescue officials and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb had previously said the death toll stood at eight. Philippe said around 50 people were injured, including three seriously, on St Martin and the nearby smaller island of St Barthelemy. Twenty-one have been hospitalised. He said officials were in the process of identifying the four dead, adding that no deaths were reported from St Barthelemy. On St Martin, 60% of homes have been damaged so badly that they are uninhabitable, Philippe said, describing the disaster as “unimaginable and unprecedented”. Power is cut across St Martin as well as supplies of potable water and petrol, he said. Roads are either partly or totally impassable, he added. However the harbour and airport are back in use, he said, noting that a military plane landed on the island Thursday. “The work will be long, emotions will run deep and the sadness will be great,” he said. On its current course, hurricane Irma is predicted to pass directly over, or quite close to, the British territories of Turk and Caicos on Thursday night, followed by a brush with the southern islands of the Bahamas and Cuba’s northern coast. On Friday night, the hurricane is expected to land at or pass near the archipelago of the Florida Keys, an area ordered evacuated by the state’s governor, Rick Scott. It’s unclear exactly where the storm will exactly strike along the coast. Scott warned that it could veer unexpectedly, and that its gigantic size means that the Gulf and Atlantic coasts alike are threatened by severe storm surges and category-four hurricane winds. Fuel has become such a scarcity in south Florida, and such a priority for governor Rick Scott, that police are escorting tankers and managing gas station service. Scott said he wanted to avoid the lapses of hurricane Andrew: enough fuel to evacuate, to supply power during the storm, and to speed up the recovery in its aftermath. The National Weather Service branch of the Florida Keys have warned in the most severe terms that everyone should leave the archipelago, saying in a midday advisory that hurricane conditions are possible within the next 48 hours. From the advisory: The hurricane’s most likely arrival time is late morning or afternoon Saturday. Storm surges of six to 10ft could push onto the islands, depending on the course of the hurricane. Hurricane force winds – a minimum of 74mph, but almost certainly far higher – extend for about 100 miles across the storm. “There are no coast guard search and rescue assets left in the Keys. The Port of Key West is to officially close 8pm Thursday. The Snake Creek Drawbridge in Islamorada is to be locked down (no openings for marine traffic) at 8pm Thursday.” Florida governor Rick Scott has activated 3,000 members of the state national guard, with plans to activate the entire state force – 7,000 people in all – on Friday. “We are expecting our state to have major impacts from Hurricane Irma and we are taking aggressive actions to make sure Florida is prepared,” Scott said in a statement. “These men and women are putting themselves in harm’s way to save the lives of their fellow Floridians while many of their own families are evacuating. I am proud of their commitment to keeping our families safe.” Earlier on Thursday, Scott pleaded with residents who have already prepared to help volunteer at shelters and distribution centers. In Key West, the police chief has warned everyone that after Friday, all hospitals will be closed after 7am local time, and there will be no helicopters available for people who choose to defy the mandatory evacuation order. Hurricane Irma killed three people as it battered Puerto Rico, with a 79-year-old woman, a younger woman, and a man among the fatalities. In a statement, governor Ricardo Rossello said that the elderly woman, who needed assistance moving, died after a fall en route to a shelter. A younger woman died in Camuy, on the north-west coast of the island, from electrocution in her home, and a man died from a traffic accident in Canóvanas, in the north-east. Eight others were reported killed in French St Martin, as well as one person in Anguilla and an infant in Barbuda. For the first time in seven years, there are currently three active hurricanes in the Atlantic: The category-five Irma, on course over Turks and Caicos, toward the southern Bahamas, and south Florida; The category-one Katia, gaining strength but stationary in the Gulf of Mexico; The category-one Jose, on a tentative path back toward Barbuda, Antigua, and Puerto Rico – the islands’ second hurricane in three days. More than a million people in Puerto Rico still lack power, the AP reports, accounting for about 70% of the territory’s Electric Power Authority. There are about 3.4 million people on the island. Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Rossello said Thursday that crews are investigating and until they know the extent of the damage, “it will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last.” Rossello added that ports on the island are still closed, and it’s unclear when commercial flights will resume. Schools and government offices are scheduled to reopen on Monday. The major counties of south Florida – Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Colliers – have been declared under a hurricane watch by state officials. Irma is currently maintaining winds of about 175mph, well above the 74mph minimum for hurricane winds, and officials fear five to 10ft storm surges for southern coastal parts of the peninsula. Shipping containers and boats piled up like toys, city blocks leveled, and buildings stripped of whole faces are just a few of the images published online by the Dutch ministry of defense from a helicopter flyby. The extent of damage, injuries, and possible deaths remains unknown from Dutch St Maarten; at least eight people were killed on the French side of the territory. The son of British billionaire Richard Branson, Sam, has posted several videos and photographs of the British Virgin Islands on his Instagram page. The images show buildings with their roofs torn from their walls, rebar and debris everywhere, and boats tossed into heaps. In a text post, Branson said there remains no power in Virgin Gorda, that some bays are flooded, 80% of Cane Garden Bay “destroyed” on the island of Tortola, and that winds and debris remain dangerous. Airports in the Bahamas are closing as Hurricane Irma nears the islands, the AP reports, while evacuations continue from southern islands closest to the storm’s projected path. The government says the international airport in Nassau will close late Thursday and it urges people who plan to leave the island chain east of Florida to check with airlines for space. Grand Bahama’s airport and the less-populated island throughout the chain will close by noon Friday. The US National Hurricane Center predicted Irma would remain at Category four or five for the next day or two as it passes just to the north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, nears the Turks &amp; Caicos and parts of the Bahamas by Thursday night and skirts Cuba on Friday night into Saturday. The south Florida counties currently in Irma’s projected course have each provided services for shelters, evacuation, and supply information. Florida’s state emergency services, with a “Know Your Zone” tool to see whether specific addresses are in an mandatory or voluntary evacuation area. Miami-Dade County, the most populous in the state and with mandatory evacuation zones along the coast. Broward County, where there are already several voluntary evacuation zones and operating shelters. Palm Beach County, where demand for fuel has outpaced supplies of it but authorities have created a number of shelters for residents. Collier County, with operating shelters and a local hotline, 239.252.8444. “If you’re in an evacuation area, do not wait to get out,” Scott says. “We can’t save you after the storm starts.” The governor tells families they should “be aggressive” in steps to protect their families. “This is not a storm you can sit and wait through.” Despite traffic, he says that roads remain without major problems, and that state authorities are working hard to get fuel back to gas stations and to the public. “I’ve been very clear to the retailers and the oil companies that we have to get the fuel out so that everybody has the fuel to evacuate,” he says. “If you’re concerned you do not have the fuel or supplies to evacuate, call 1.800.955.5504, a dedicated transport hotline.” Scott says that Expedia is helping provide hotel services for evacuees and Comcast internet services around the state. He says he has requested tarps, water, baby food, supply trucks, personnel and equipment from the federal government; mobilized the federal guard; and received assurances that “anybody that responded to Texas has been demobilized to come to Florida if we need them.” He makes a plea for volunteers to help with sandbags, shelters, and other state coordination efforts, saying Florida needs thousands more to help. Fuel is a particular priority, he says, not just for evacuations but to get the state’s services – hospitals, shelters, etc – back into working condition. “We’re going to have downed power lines, we’re going to have debris, we’re going to have all those typical things,” he says, recalling the slow and painful recovery from hurricane Andrew. “We’ve got to survive this storm, and then we’ve got to get back Scott fields a question about Lake Okeechobee and the threat of flooding. “This storm is moving fast so we will not get the same rain that Texas got,” the governor says. “The biggest risk with the dike at Okeechobee is rain.” He stresses, again, that no one should doubt the danger of this storm. “Every Florida family must be prepared to evacuate regardless of the coast you live on.” Florida governor Rick Scott has delivered a press conference to update residents about what the state is doing and what Floridians can do to protect themselves. Miami Dade county, the most populated in the state, should expect “deadly storm surge and life threatening winds”, Scott says. “We can expect this along the entire east coast,” he continues, with landfall in the Florida Keys as early as Friday night. “Look at the size of this storm. It is huge,” Scott says. “It is wider than our entire state and could case major and life-threatening impacts on both coasts, coast to coast. Floridians on the west coast cannot be complacent. The west coast will still have hurricane conditions, and these storms can move and change.” “Remember hurricane Andrew was one of the worst storms in the history of Florida – this is much worse and more devastating in its current path.” He has ordered mandatory evacuations for two zones in the county, and urged residents to check their zone with Florida’s emergency management authorities. There are also evacuation zones in Collier County and Broward County. “You do not need to evacuate out of the state or hundreds of miles away to stay safe. Find shelters in your county,” Scott says. More than 31,000 people have already evacuated from the Keys. In south Florida, gas stations have run out of fuel, stores of water, and hardware stores of plywood. Authorities are scrambling to dole out sandbags and other supplies to shore up homes, while people in coastal stretches are fleeing inland or north. Governor Rick Scott is due to give a press conference within minutes. Hello and welcome to Thursday’s coverage of Hurricane Irma. Here’s a round-up of the latest news: The eye of Hurricane Irma, still a category 5 storm with sustained winds of 180mph (290kph), moved westward off the northern coast of Hispaniola on Thursday morning, its winds raking the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm’s projected path Thursday brings it almost directly over the British possessions of Turks and Caicos, followed by a course near the southern Bahamas. At least 10 people have been reported dead in the wake of the storm: an infant on Barbuda, one person in Anguilla and eight in the French territory of St Martin. Thousands more remain in shelters, their homes damaged or destroyed. In Puerto Rico, almost a million people are without power and 50,000 without water, according to the US territory’s department of emergency relief. Florida governor Rick Scott has ordered mandatory evacuations for coastal stretches of south Florida, including the vulnerable Florida Keys. Fuel shortages have begun at gas stations around the state, which only has two major north-south highways, and authorities have opened shelters in inland areas. The storm is expected to make landfall in Florida early Saturday, though it remains unclear where exactly the hurricane will hit the mainland. On Barbuda, prime minister Gaston Browne said Irma had made 90% of the tiny island’s structures “literally rubble” and that half the population was homeless. On French-administered St Martin, local councilman Daniel Gibbs told a local radio station “95% of the island is destroyed”. French authorities have sent naval ships with supplies to the island.

President Donald Trump has declared states of emergency in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida. “Do not ignore evacuation orders,” Scott told Floridians on Wednesday. “We can rebuild your home but we cannot rebuild your life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2013/sep/24/damian-mcbride-publisher-scuffle-protestor-iain-dale","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-24T11:08:31Z","webTitle":"Damian McBride's publisher in on-air scuffle with anti-nuclear protester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/24/damian-mcbride-publisher-scuffle-protestor-iain-dale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2013/sep/24/damian-mcbride-publisher-scuffle-protestor-iain-dale","fields":{"headline":"Damian McBride's publisher in on-air scuffle with anti-nuclear protester","bodyText":"It always promised to be a combative party conference, but Labour's political roadshow more than lived up to its billing on Tuesday when Damian McBride's publisher was caught by TV news cameras in an \"unseemly\" on-air scuffle with a protestor on Brighton seafront. Iain Dale, the political blogger and publisher behind McBride's controversial memoirs about his time as Gordon Brown's spin doctor, grappled with the man and his dog before tumbling to the ground in view of the television cameras. Dale was seen grabbing the protester's backpack and attempting to haul him out of shot as the feisty terrier – which carried placards reading \"No Nukes\" on its back – appeared to bite its owner on the backside. The usually mild-mannered publisher later said he had been trying to remove the protestor from the background of live television interviews, but the commotion was beamed to the nation on ITV's Daybreak and posted online by Channel 5. In a blogpost published after the altercation, Dale explained that he had hoped to do \"what any self respecting publisher would do\" and pull the man away from the cameras, but said it had ended in an \"unseemly tumble on the ground\". \"I am someone who runs a mile from any form of physical confrontation normally, but I never understand why broadcasters seem to accept without question that someone with a placard or a loud voice should disrupt this sort of interview,\" he said. \"In some ways I have committed the cardinal sin of becoming the story myself, rather than my author, and I regret that. But do I regret that I stepped in to protect my author? No, I do not. \"Everyone has an inalienable right to protest, but no one has a right to make a continual nuisance of themselves and interrupt interviews like that.\" Dale sought to defuse the situation further by insisting that there was \"no real violence\" involved and that \"the only injury was when the man's dog bit him on the bum\". \"Anyway, now you can see why my publishing company is called Biteback,\" he added. The protester, Stuart Holmes, has become a fixture of party conference season, regularly accosting politicians and pundits outside political venues along with his dog, also named Stuart. Holmes told the Guardian he had agreed not to press charges against Dale, adding that publicity is \"what is really important to me\". \"The police asked if I wanted to make a statement, and if they [the police] want to pursue it I will talk to them,\" he said. \"But I'm only interested in getting publicity for my campaign – I can't believe that all political parties are now in favour of nuclear power.\" A spokeswoman for Sussex police said it had been \"made aware of the incident and is looking into the circumstances\". • To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Last week my colleague Damian Carrington presented what looked like proof that the impact was negligible: German emissions fell in the period and anyhow Germany remained a net exporter of electricity. I agree with Carrington on most issues but in this case I don't believe the argument stacks up. I want to explain why, not because I have a particularly strong view on nuclear power, but because it's a good opportunity to make a broader point that I think is important and too often missed. It boils down to this: to meaningfully measure the impact of any action on a climate change, you need to recognise that the world is interconnected and measure the effects as widely as possible. In addition, you need to ask the right question, which means – just as with a medical experiment – comparing \"with and without\" the action, not \"before and after\" it. German nuclear is a nice example. If you look just at Germany's emissions and you compare \"before the nuclear switch off\" with \"after the nuclear switch off\", then you might conclude that turning off atomic plants cuts carbon emissions. But that would be the wrong conclusion. For one thing, the carbon savings in Germany were – as Carrington points out – partly or perhaps entirely the result of a mild winter. The obvious point here is that if you'd had the nuclear plants running and a mild winter, emissions would most likely have been lower still. More importantly, though, in a continent-wide energy market it doesn't make sense to look only at Germany. You also need to consider the implications of the fact that switching off the nuclear plants led to Germany's exports of electricity falling through the floor – by a massive 63 trillion units, according to Carrington. Unless you think the countries which would have used that power simply turned the lights off, the unavoidable implication is that somewhere a bunch of fossil fuel plants were ramped up to pick up the slack. And not just any fossil fuel plants, but those with available capacity – which will generally mean dirty old ones because the cheaper and more efficient ones, along with all the renewables and nuclear, will already have been working at full capacity. The core point is this: until we get a 100% decarbonised grid, the marginal impact of turning off any existing low-carbon electricity source – or indeed adding to demand by switching a light on – is virtually always to add more coal to a power station. Of course, it's true, as Carrington points out, that the emissions of the whole European electricity grid are already capped by the Emissions Trading System. The implication here is that it doesn't matter if other countries burn more coal as a result of Germany exporting less power because the result will be fewer carbon permits being available for other sectors or countries – so it will all come out in the wash. But that doesn't quite stack up either, for three reasons. First, the \"it's capped so it doesn't matter\" argument is a double-edged sword: we can't use it here unless we'd also have been happy for E.ON to use it to justify building a new unabated coal plant at Kingsnorth. Second, it ignores that the ETS allows offsets via the Clean Development Mechanism, many of which have been shown to be leaky. Third, the more easily and cheaply we meet the ETS cap by cutting emissions now, the more politically and economically feasible it will be to tighten it in the future. But those are only the obvious ripple effects. There will be many others that will be harder to pin down. For example, the phase out will surely have contributed to some extent to the decline of the major German aluminium smelter which recently filed for bankruptcy on the basis of rising costs – i.e. power and bauxite – and falling prices. (Again, bear in mind that it doesn't even matter whether electricity prices have risen or fallen relative to before: what matters is whether they'd have been higher or lower without the phase out.) The smelter winding up is obviously bad from the perspective of the company's workers, but environmentally you might think it's a win, because it will result in less energy-intensive aluminium being produced. I suspect, though, that the opposite is true. What seems more plausible is that the bauxite that would have been processed in that plant will instead end up being processed in smelters in countries with cheaper power. If, for the sake of argument, the bauxite found its way to smelters in China, then the overall result would probably be more emissions, due to the inefficient and coal-fired Chinese energy system. Moreover, at this point the ETS argument is relevant, because we'd have taken a heavy industry from within a regional carbon cap and moved it outside of it, massively adding to overall carbon output – and indeed shifting emissions from a country pushing for a global carbon deal to one that's less in favour and now will have another reason to be even less in favour. This isn't an argument for nuclear power. It's an argument for thinking about things the right way. The marginal impact lens also affects how you view lots of other situations. For example, even if you sign up for a green electricity tariff, the marginal impact of switching the lights on or off will be to boost or reduce fossil fuel use, because the renewable energy on the grid will always be running at maximum capacity anyway. (Which isn't to say that there isn't any point in signing up, as I try to explain here.) Similarly, much as I adore my wood burning stove, the marginal impact of throwing an extra log on the fire will be more carbon going into the air, even if you assume that wood is a zero-carbon fuel. That's because if I didn't burn it, the wood could instead have been burned in a power plant (displacing coal) or turned into furniture or building materials (locking in the CO2 and displacing energy-intensive metals or plastics). There is, however, yet another layer to all this. Signing up for a green tariff or buying a wood stove has cultural ripple effects – such as sending a signal that you care about the environment – in addition to any direct carbon ripple effects. These are even harder to pin down, but they can't be ignored. So what are the broader cultural, political and economic ripples of the German nuclear phase-out? On the one hand, it will send a signal to the world that nuclear is dated and dangerous and that switching it off is a greater priority than limiting carbon emissions as swiftly as possible. It will also damage the nuclear industry. These two factors together will probably decrease the likelihood that the nuclear industry will succeed in finding ways to reverse its cost curve and make this large-scale low-carbon power source cheaper in the future (unlike renewables, nuclear is currently getting more expensive rather than less). On the other hand if, specifically as the result of the nuclear phase out, Germany massively ups its level of ambition for renewables and is able to demonstrate that it's possible to maintain public support for high energy prices to stimulate a clean-energy revolution, that too could influence the world far beyond its own borders. I suspect Germany has already done this in ways that many nuclear advocates have deliberately or inadvertently ignored. For example, when George Monbiot wrote that German subsidies of solar had failed and casually dismissed solar panels in northerly countries as \"populist gimmicks\" supported by regressive taxes, he ignored the fact that Germany's generous feed-in tariff is widely credited with having been the single biggest driver of tumbling solar prices worldwide. So even if solar is expensive in Germany, making it cheaper there will also make it cheaper for everyone else – including the millions who live without electricity in areas where solar is the cheapest power source but still out of reach. Germans buying solar has also helped boost renewables industries in China, which is crucial as it creates a lobby there who will eventually start pushing for a global climate deal to help cement green-tech markets in the US and elsewhere. (The early stages of this debate are already starting to play out in the odd diplomatic wrangle about US solar import tariffs.) Of course, it might have been more efficient for the Germans to simply buy solar panels from China and donate them to poor countries. But that would have been less politically feasible for a simple reason: people in Germany want solar panels. They like them, and feel engaged by them. That matters too, because at the moment people feel miserable and unempowered about the whole topic. Which perhaps explains why having solar also appears to help people reduce their power consumption: another ripple we shouldn't ignore. My own view is that Germany should have kept its nuclear plants running and invested massively in renewables and demand reduction – and next-generation nuclear research for good measure. But that isn't the point of this piece. What I'm trying to say is that everyone involved in the climate and energy debate needs to think more holistically and dispassionately about what will and won't work. We need a better quality of analysis and debate. We need to stop overstating our case. And most of all we need to stop bickering!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-27T16:03:42Z","webTitle":"Labour MP Naz Shah suspended from party over antisemitism row -  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Labour MP Naz Shah suspended from party over antisemitism row -  as it happened","bodyText":"The Labour party has suspended the Bradford West MP Naz Shah over antisemitic Facebook posts made before she was elected to parliament. The announcement came a few hours after Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement which condemned her comments but did not suspend her. Labour has not yet explained why action was not taken earlier. Ken Livingstone, the Corbyn ally and former London mayor, has told LBC suspending Shah was a mistake. This is from LBC’s Matthew Harris. David Crompton, the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police has been suspended in the wake of the Hillsborough inquest findings. On Tuesday Crompton admitted the force got the policing of the match “catastrophically wrong” and “unequivocally” accepted the inquest jury’s conclusions. South Yorkshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said he had no choice but to act “based on the erosion of public trust and confidence”. Earlier in the Commons, in a statement widely praised by MPs from all sides of the House, Theresa May, the home secretary, said she was “disappointed” by how the force responded to the inquest verdicts. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said the force was “rotten to the core” in his own speech which was so powerful it was applauded by MPs. (See 2.14pm.) Officials implicated in the unlawful killing of 96 Liverpool fans in theHillsborough disaster could face prosecution for criminal negligence and perjury, May has said. David Cameron has hinted at concessions on his plan to force all schools to become academies, saying they will still be able to work with councils. As Rowena Mason reports, he said further plans would be brought forward at the Queen’s speech next month, and suggested schools who wanted the support of local authorities would be able to receive it. His comments suggest the government may be preparing a compromise that would let local authorities be involved in running academies, amid a threatened rebellion. Cameron has rejected an attempt by the House of Lords to force the UK to take in child refugees from Europe, arguing that they are in safe countries and not comparable to those fleeing Nazi Germany. Kezia Dugdale has put her party’s plan to increase income taxes to 50p for Scotland’s richest residents at the centre of Scottish Labour’s election campaign, a week before polling stations open. The last to unveil a manifesto for the Holyrood election, the Scottish Labour leader said raising income tax was the “big choice” facing voters on 5 May, in stark contrast to the £3bn in cuts she claimed the Scottish National party would need to make.“ But, as Severin Carrell reports, minutes after her speech a new poll for STV by Ipsos Mori predicted that Scottish Labour could finish third behind the Tories – echoing some other polls putting the two parties neck and neck. The poll found the Tories two points ahead of Labour in the regional vote to select 56 MSPs but one point behind in the constituency vote to choose 73 directly elected members. It forecast that this would result in the Tories taking 23 seats against Labour’s 20 – 17 seats down on Labour’s take in 2011. Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2016 as factors unrelated to the looming in/out EU referendum put a brake on growth. George Osborne’s decision to impose a £10,000 tax-free cap on pension contributions is deterring well-paid lawyers from becoming judges, the lord chief justice has said. As Owen Bowcott reports, appearing before the House of Lords constitution committee, Lord Thomas said the move was having a very serious effect on judicial recruitment from an “immensely prosperous” profession. The cut in the £40,000-a-year cap for those earning more than £150,000 in last July’s budget had significantly reduced the financial attractiveness of posts on the bench compared with lucrative work in the private sector, he said. British households will be saddled with a tax-like financial burden for years if they vote to leave the EU, one of the world’s leading forecasting groups has warned. Lord Heseltine has said Margaret Thatcher would have voted to remain in in the EU. In an interview with the New Statesman the pro-European Heseltine, whose leadership challenge led to her resignation in 1990, said: She would have voted to stay in. That’s what she always did. There were two Mrs Thatchers: what she did and what she said. Party management often demanded language which perhaps didn’t completely reflect the decision-making for which she was responsible. She knew that Britain’s self-interest was inextricably interwoven with Europe and that’s why she was personally responsible for the biggest sharing of sovereignty in British history - the Single European Act. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. More on the BuzzFeed allegation. (See 3.55pm.) This is from the Jewish Chronicle’s Marcus Dysch. David Crompton, chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, has been suspended over his response to Hillsborough, the BBC reports. Earlier in the Commons Theresa May, the home secretary, said she was “disappointed” by the force’s reaction to the verdicts. (See 1.45pm.) The Labour party has suspended the MP Naz Shah. A party spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn and Naz Shah have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary. Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed. This is rather odd. Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement about her this morning, after they had spoken, which did not say she would be suspended. (See 11.47am.) Since then she has issued a written apology (see 12.02pm) and apologised in the Commons (see 2.53pm). And now she is being suspended. I will try to find out why. According to BuzzFeed’s Jim Waterson, the original draft of the apology Naz Shah issued this morning was edited by Labour HQ before it was published to remove mention of the term “antisemitic”. Here is a Guardian video of Naz Shah’s apology. Here is the full text of Naz Shah’s apology to MPs. Mr Speaker, can I can seek your advice on how I can express my deep sorrow for something the prime minister referred to earlier. As you know, when a government minister makes a mistake they can correct the record. I hope you will allow me to say that I fully acknowledge that I have made a mistake and I wholeheartedly apologise to this House for the words I used before I became a member. I accept and understand that the words I used caused upset and hurt to the Jewish community and I deeply regret that. Antisemitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none. I am grateful and thankful for the support and advice I have received from many Jewish friend and colleagues, advice I intend to act upon. I truly regret what I did and I hope, I sincerely hope, that this House will accept my profound apology. The Hillsborough statement is now over. Immediately afterwards the Labour MP Naz Shah rose to make a point of order and used it to make a “wholehearted apology” to the Commons for the Facebook posts she made before she became an MP. She said she understood why the words she used caused offence. Antisemitism is racism, full stop, she said. She said that as an MP she would do everything she could to improve relations between Muslims, Jews and people of all faiths. I will post the full quotes shortly. Labour’s Toby Perkins asks May if she has confidence in the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police. May says there will be elections to for the police and crime commissioner next week. She goes one to say: It behoves South Yorkshire Police to recognise the import of the verdicts that were brought out yesterday. I hope that we will not see attempts to try and somehow suggest that those verdicts were not clear, or in any way wrong. That jury sat through 296 days of evidence and they were clear about the role of South Yorkshire Police officers. Andrew Slaughter, the Labour MP and shadow justice minister, asks May to think carefully about her plan to get rid of the European convention on human rights. He says the ECHR guarantees that inquests like this one go ahead. May says the attorney general made a statement on the ECHR yesterday. But she says she is concerned about the need to get to the truth when there are unexplained deaths. That is why she set up an inquiry into deaths in custody, she says. Labour’s Mike Kane says he used to follow his football team at Hillsborough. “Apart from going to hell”, what will happen to those who lied about what happened there, he asks. May says that is a matter for the criminal investigations. The Times has admitted today that it made a mistake when it did not mention Hillsborough on the front page of its first edition, my colleague Jane Martinson reports. Labour’s David Anderson asks May what action will be taken to expose everyone, including elected officials, who played any role in this cover-up, by omission or commission. Because they are as guilty as everyone else, he says. There are people who need to be called to account. May says the report from the Hillsborough Independent Panel showed the truth of what had happened. That required organisations that had previously been silent to come forward and give evidence. She says there has been a “collective recognition” in the Commons today that the procedures that should have led to the truth coming out failed. MPs are not supposed to clap in the House of Commons (a rule introduced to stop MPs using sustained clapping to disrupt proceedings) but occasionally, after an exceptional speech, MPs do applaud. It happened when Hilary Benn spoke in the debate on bombing Islamic State in Syria. And it happened again today after Andy Burnham’s statement. Here are edited extracts. On why the verdict took so long When it came, their verdict was simple, clear, powerful, emphatic. But it begged the question – how could something so obvious have taken so long? Three reasons. First, a police force which has consistently put protecting itself above protecting people harmed by Hillsborough. Second, collusion between that force and complicit print media. Third, a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in authority over and above ordinary people. On the need for a ‘Hillsborough clause’ in the policing bill Of course, the behaviour of some officers, while reprehensible, was not necessarily criminal. But, through retirement, police officers can still escape misconduct proceedings. In her Policing and Crime Bill, the Home Secretary proposes a 12-month period after retirement where proceedings can be initiated. One of the lessons of Hillsborough is that there must be no arbitrary time limits on justice and accountability. So will the Home Secretary work with me to insert a Hillsborough clause into her Bill – ending the scandal of retirement as an escape route and of wrong-doers claiming full pensions – and apply it retrospectively? On South Yorkshire Police The much bigger question for the South Yorkshire Police to answer today is this: why, at this Inquest, did they go back on their 2012 public apology? When the Lord Chief Justice quashed the original inquest, he requested that the new one not degenerate into an “adversarial battle”. Sadly, Mr Speaker, that is exactly what happened. Shamefully, the cover-up continued in this Warrington court room. Millions of pounds of public money were spent re-telling discredited lies ... Does the home secretary agree that, because of his handling of this Inquest, the position of the Chief Constable is now untenable ... Will the home secretary now order the fundamental reform of this force and consider all potential options? On the links with Orgreave, and the need for full disclosure I promised the families the whole truth about Hillsborough. I don’t believe they will have it until we know the truth about Orgreave. This force used the same underhand tactics against its own people in the aftermath of the miners’ strike that it would later use, to more deadly effect, against the people of Liverpool. There has been an IPCC report on Orgreave. But parts of it are redacted. It has been put to me that those contain evidence of direct links between Orgreave and Hillsborough. This is a time for transparency, not secrecy – time for the people of South Yorkshire to know the full truth about their police force. So will the Home Secretary accept the legal submission from the Orgreave Truth &amp; Justice Campaign and set up a disclosure process? This force hasn’t learned and hasn’t changed. Mr Speaker, let me be clear – I don’t blame the ordinary police officers, the men and women who did their best on the day and who today are out keeping our streets safe. But I do blame their leadership and culture, which seems rotten to the core. Orgreave, Hillsborough, Rotherham – how much more evidence do we need before we act? On the press, and the need for phase two of the Leveson inquiry to go ahead No-one in the police or media has ever been held to account for the incalculable harm they caused in smearing a whole city in its moment of greatest grief ... Leveson recommended a second-stage inquiry to look at the sometimes unhealthy relationship between police and press. I know the Hillsborough families feel strongly that this must be taken forward. So will the government end the delay and honour the Prime Minister’s promises to the victims of press intrusion? On the judicial system Why should the authorities be able to spend public money like water to protect themselves while families have no such help? So will the government consider further reforms to the coronial system, including giving the bereaved at least equal legal funding as public bodies? On Theresa May not playing any part in the cover-up This cover-up went right to the top. It was advanced in the committee rooms of this House and in the press rooms of 10 Downing Street. It persisted because of collusion between elites in politics, police and the media. But this home secretary stood outside of that. And today I express my sincere admiration and gratitude to her for the stance she has consistently taken in righting this wrong. On the Hillsborough relatives It has been the privilege of my life to work with them all. They have prevailed against all the odds. They have kept their dignity in the face of terrible adversity. They could not have shown a more profound love for those they lost on that day. They truly represent the best of what our country is all about. The Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke asks May if she would support merging the various Yorkshire police forces. That would get rid of the name of South Yorkshire Police, he says. May says Shelbrooke knows that government’s view on merging police forces. (She is opposed.) But she says South Yorkshire Police needs to reflect on yesterday’s verdict. May says she is opposed to merger of Yorkshire police forces. Here is the full quote from Theresa May on South Yorkshire Police. I think everybody will be disappointed and indeed concerned by some of the remarks that have been made by South Yorkshire Police today. There was a very clear verdict yesterday in relation to the decisions that were taken by police officers and the action of police officers on 15 April 1989 and I would urge South Yorkshire Police force to recognise the verdict of the jury. Yes, they must get on with the day to day job today of policing within their force area. But I think they do need to look at what happened, at what the verdicts have shown, recognise the truth and be willing to accept that. Chris Heaton-Harris, a Conservative, asks May what she thinks of South Yorkshire Police’s conduct. Theresa May says everybody will be concerned by some of the remarks made by South Yorkshire Police today. There was a very clear verdict yesterday, she says. She urges South Yorkshire Police to accept the verdict and “recognise the truth”. May criticises South Yorkshire Police for refusing to fully accept the inquest verdict. It should “recognise the truth”, she says. I will post May’s full quote shortly. And this is what Theresa May said in her opening statement about the criminal investigations underway, and the possible offences that may have been committed. The House will understand that I cannot comment in detail on matters that may lead to a criminal investigation. I can, however, say that the offences under investigation include gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice and perjury, as well as offences under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Here is the start of the Press Association story about Theresa May’s statement. Ministers must consider how the state responds to disasters like Hillsborough to make sure the suffering of families is better taken into account, Theresa May said as she praised victims’ relatives for their “extraordinary dignity and determination”. An inquest jury ruled that the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the Sheffield stadium disaster in 1989 were unlawfully killed and there are now calls for further action to be taken. The home secretary read the jury’s determinations in full to a hushed House of Commons as she outlined the criminal charges that are being investigated. The inquest lasted two years and found that blunders by South Yorkshire’s police and ambulance services “caused or contributed to” the deaths. The jury found that Liverpool fans were not to blame for what happened. May said the outcome of the inquest was of “national significance”. “The conclusion of the inquest brings to an end an important step since the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s report,” she said. “Thanks to that report and now the determinations of the inquests we know the truth of what happened on that day at Hillsborough. “Naturally the families will want to reflect on yesterday’s historic outcome which is of national significance. “I am also clear that this raises significant issues for the way that the state and its agencies deal with disasters. “Once the formal investigations are concluded we should step back, reflect and act if necessary so that we can better respond to disasters and ensure that the suffering of families is taken into account.” These are from the BBC’s Vicki Young. South Yorkshire Police has issued a fresh statement this morning saying that during the inquest it never sought to defend its failures over Hillsborough. It also says that the coroner himself said that its previous apology should not be admitted into the proceedings because that would be prejudicial. Here is the statement, as reported by the Press Association. In 2012, the chief constable made a full apology for the failures of South Yorkshire Police (SYP) and the force has stood by that ever since. In the aftermath of the verdicts, the chief constable apologised again and unequivocally accepted the jury’s conclusions. We have been asked about our conduct at the inquests. The coroner himself gave a clear ruling that specifically addresses the relationship between apologies and evidence at the inquests. He ruled that to admit the previous 2012 apology by the chief constable into proceedings would be ‘wrong’ and ‘highly prejudicial’. He also ruled that the conduct of SYP during the inquests was not inconsistent with this earlier apology. The force has taken careful note of the coroner’s comments during the inquests and has sought to be open and transparent at all stages. It is important to remember that inquests are not about guilt, liability or blame, but about establishing the facts. The intention throughout these proceedings has been to assist the jury understand the facts. We have never sought, at any stage, to defend the failures of SYP or its officers. Nevertheless, these failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors. In other words, where do the failings of SYP stand in the overall picture? We are sorry if our approach has been perceived as at odds with our earlier apology, this was certainly not our intention. And here is my colleague Vikram Dodd’s take on it. Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, says this ranks with Bloody Sunday as “one of the most disgraceful cover-ups of our time”. She says she agrees with Burnham about the need to take action to stop police officers being able to evade disciplinary action by retiring. And she says the relatives might never have got another inquest if it had not been for the European convention on human rights, because the ECHR guarantees the right to have incidents of this kind properly investigated. May says responds to the ECHR by saying the right to request an inquest, and fresh inquest, existed in the UK long before the ECHR was drawn up. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says mistakes will always be made. The real issue is how long it took for the relatives to get redress, and a proper account of the issues. This is not a unique event, he says. There have been similar episodes, like Bloody Sunday. He says Theresa May has done “everything right”. But this is not just about systems; it is about attitudes, and the tendency to brush away problems that make us uncomfortable. May is responding to Burnham. She says most of the general public believed the stories they read about the fans. To have stood up against that showed a steely determination, and a passionate commitment to justice. We will rarely see that again, she says. On the timings of the decisions about criminal prosecutions, she says files will go to the CPS around the end of the year. Then the CPS will need time to consider them. She understands why people want this to happen more quickly. But this has to be done quickly. On police officers avoiding misconduct proceedings by retiring, May says she has always thought this was wrong. She is happy to meet Labour to discuss this. On the Leveson inquiry, she says the government will consider whether to go ahead with phase two of the inquiry when all prosecutions are over. Burnham says he wants to finish by paying tribute to the relatives. It has been the privilege of his life to stand alongside them, he says. They represent the best of what this country is. Burnham receives a round of applause - a highly unusual move in the Commons, and a tribute to what was a remarkably moving and powerful statement. Burnham says the families were not properly represented at earlier stages in this process. One of the reasons they were successful at the inquest was that, at last, they had the best legal representation. He says it is wrong that public bodies can spend as much as they want defending themselves in inquests, while families cannot do that. He says Westminster was involved. He says the cover-up was defended in committee rooms in the Commons, and in the press room at Number 10. But Theresa May played no part in that, he says. He pays tribute to her for ensuring the inquest got to the truth. Burnham says collusion between the police and the print media made Hillsborough worse. He says the Leveson inquiry recommendations need to be fully implemented. Burnham is now going through those issues in detail. He urges May to ensure that decisions on prosecution are taken before the end of the year. Will the government include a Hillsborough clause into the crime bill to ensure that police officers cannot evade misconduct charges by retiring, with no cost to their pension. And this should be retrospective, he says. He says millions of pounds were spend during the inquest recycling discredited lies. If the South Yorkshire Police had maintained their apology, the inquest would have been much shorter. He says South Yorkshire Police had apologised, but they went back on that. He says it pains him to say Yorkshire Ambulance Service did the same. He says the South Yorkshire chief constable should resign. Burnham calls for South Yorkshire chief constable to resign. He says there were similarities between what happened at Hillsborough and what happened at Orgreave. He calls for full publication of the papers relating to Orgreave. Burnham claims secret Orgeave papers show a direct link between what happened at Hillsborough and what happened at Orgreave. He says South Yorkshire Police was corrupt. All solutions should be considered to clean it up, he says. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary and leading campaigner on behalf of the Hillsborough families, is responding to May. He says there was a 27-year cover up. He thanks the jury for what they did. The verdict was “simple, clear, powerful and emphatic”. But how could something so obvious take so long? There are three reason. First, the police force covered up what they did. Second, there was collusion between the police and the print media. And, third, the justice system was flawed. May says for 27 years the families have fought for justice. They have faced opposition, hostility and obfuscation. The authorities tried to protect themselves, instead of acting in the public interest. The families did not give up. They were extraordinary. She says MPs should recognise their courage and resolve. She says she hopes that for the families and survivors yesterday’s verdict will bring them closer to the peace they deserve. She says Bishop James has agreed to stay on as her adviser on Hillsborough. May says the Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether there will be prosecutions, on the basis of the criminal investigations. She says possible offences being investigated include gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice, perjury, offences against the Sports Grounds Act and offences against the Health and Safety Act. She says decisions on prosecutions should be taken around the end of the year. But she says she wants to ensure that support for the families continues. May says the jury also heard evidence about the “valiant efforts” made by many fans to save people. There is cheering for this. She says the verdict that the victims were unlawfully killed is of great public importance. But they do not amount to a finding of criminal liability. And no one should impute criminal liability while investigations are still being carried out, she says. This is from the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard. And this is from the former Independent on Sunday political editor Jane Merrick. May is now summarising the jury’s findings. She says she wants to put those findings on the record. She reads them out. The 14 questions for the jury, and the answers the jury gave to each of them, are set out here. May says there are two criminal investigations underway. Since the fresh inquest opened in 2014 the jury heard 296 days’ of evidence. It was the longest inquest in British legal history. She says MPs will want to thank the jury for their public service. May says the relatives suffered the injustice of hearing their loved ones blamed. She has met members of the families on a number of occasions. She has never failed to be struck by “their extraordinary dignity and determination”. She says they have never given up. She pays tribute to Andy Burnham for campaigning tirelessly on their behalf, and to other Liverpool MPs for their campaigning too. May says her statement will cover the inquest, and the steps that will now take place. She says the events at Hillsborough shocked the country. She summarises what happened. It was this country’s worst disaster at a sporting event. She says the search by families to get to the truth has been “long and arduous”. Theresa May, the home secretary, is now making a statement on Hillsborough. The Conservative Julian Lewis says Britain’s admiration for France will never diminish, no matter what happens in the referendum. He asks Cameron to pay tribute to Bill Cash’s father, who was killed fighting in France after the Normandy invasion, and to a veteran who is due to receive the legion d’honneur in his 90s for his wartime service. Cameron pays tribute to those who served in the war. Labour’s Emma Reynolds says millions of Britons from the European health insurance card. What would happen to that if we left the EU? Cameron says this is one of the benefits we have year. We can make the system better. It is those in favour of leaving who need to explain what would happen to that system if we left. Labour’s Yvette Cooper says Cameron, in his reply to Angus Robertson earlier (which I missed because I was doing the PMQS summary) said child refugees in Europe are safe. They are not, she says. She says there are 1,000 in Greece who have nowhere to sleep. And they are exposed to sexual exploitation. Why won’t the government accept the Dubs amendment? Cameron says the government is taking child refugees from refugees camps. It has nothing to be ashamed of, he says. John Stevenson, a Conservative, asks if decisions on nuclear power and nuclear submarines will be made soon. Cameron says there will be a vote in the Commons on Trident. Labour’s Judith Cummins asks if Cameron is committed to the electrification of the Calder Valley line. Cameron says commitments have been made on electrification. He wants everywhere to benefit from the Northern Powerhouse. Mike Wood, a Conservative, asks about an enterprise zone in his Dudley South constituency. Cameron says enterprise zones have been a success. Labour’s Liz McInnnes asks if Cameron agrees that sentences for causing death by dangerous driving should be higher. Cameron says he has every sympathy for families affected. The maximum current sentence is 14 years, but the government will look at this, he says. Suella Fernandes, a Conseratives, asks Cameron to reassure MPs of his commitment to fighting antisemitism. Cameron says antisemitism is racism and we should fight it. He says it is “extraordinary” that a Labour MP who talked about the “transportation” of Israel and that being a “solution” still has the Labour whip. Cameron says there was no British steel in the new Forth Bridge. He says, unlike the Scottish government, the Westminster government backs the British steel industry. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw asks about the EU referendum and Nigel Farage - pronouncing his name to rhyme with garage. Cameron says he is pleased Bradshaw has gone for the English pronunciation, rather than the rather “poncy” foreign one that is more common. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn said that repeats often attract more viewers than the first broadcast, but they often disappoint too, and that was his experience today. Last week he successfully exposed Tory divisions over forced academisation, and exposed the rather shallow evidence base for the policy. Today he devoted all six questions to the same issue, but he did not have enough new material to discomfort Cameron, and Cameron’s willingness to give a direct answer to the question about whether the academies bill will be in the Queen’s speech (yes), plus his ability to reference Wilshaw and the OECD, allowed him to see Corbyn off. You could tell Cameron was winning because his references to the need for a strong economy etc were kept to a minimum, and, having made a very brief reference to Naz Shah, he did not feel the need to launch a lengthy counter-offensive on Labour anti-semitism. Corbyn says the number of pupils in over-sized councils is getting worse. And he quotes Conservative council leaders who are opposed to the policy. Cameron says he is glad Corbyn is quoting Tory council leaders. He hopes there will be more in 10 days’ time. There are 13,000 more teachers than in 2010. He quotes someone from the Academies Trust saying she used to be opposed to academies, but is now coming round to the idea. He says he backs aspiration and opportunity. Labour want to hold it back. Corbyn says there seems to be a pattern developing here. (That generates laughter, because Corbyn is asking similar questions to last week.) Corbyn says, in health and education, ministers are imposing solutions. When will the goverment listen to the professionals, and trust other people to run services. Cameron says 1.9m more people are being treated in the NHS, and there are 1.3m more children in good schools. There is another pattern he can see. He is on his fifth Labour leader. Soon he could be on his sixth. Corbyn says it has been claimed the government will let councils form academy trusts. This would give them more power. So why bother with forced academisation? Camerons says he wants schools to be good or outstanding. And good and outstanding schools can improve. He urges Labour MPs to be quiet, and to deal with the anti-semites in the party. There are lots of ways schools can become academies. They can look at working with local authorities. Academies are great, he says. He says Labour is moving in favour of them. Corbyn says sometimes repeats on TV get more viewers than first time round. (Cameron said earlier he favoured repeats.) Teacher shortages are more important, he says. Parents and teachers do not want this. Who does want this top-down reorganisation. Cameron says Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, and the OECD are in favour. And academy trusts. On teacher shortages, Camerons says there are more teachers and more school places than under Labour. Jeremy Corbyn says, after 27 years, the 96 people killed at Hillsborough finally got justice. He is glad Cameron has apologised for the action of previous governments. He pays tribute to the relatives, and to Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram and other Labour MPs who campaigned on this. Corbyn says last week Cameron said he would put rocket boosters under the academisation programme. Now the wheels seem to be falling off the rocket boosters. Can Cameron confirm that? (He is referring to reports the government is backing down over forced academisation.) Cameron says he has not met a rocket booster with a wheel on it, but rocket science is not his subject - or Corbyn’s. Academies raise standards, he says. Corbyn says Cameron did not provide much of an answer. Will he legislate to force schools to become academies in the Queen’s Speech. Cameron says he cannot pre-empt what is in the Queen’s Speech. But, on this, he can. We are going to have academies for all and it will be in the Queen’s Speech. Mims Davies, a Conservative, says in Eastleigh the service that GPs provide is crucial. Does Cameron agree the recent announcement about £2.4bn for GPs is only possible because there is a strong government. Cameron, as you would expect, says she’s right. David Cameron starts by saying yesterday was a “momentous day” for the Hillsborough relatives. Their search for justice was met with obfuscation, not openness. But they never faltered. We all owe them a debt of gratitude. Naz Shah has just tweeted this. This is from LabourList’s Conor Pope. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs on the order paper down to ask a question. The Jewish Chronicle’s Marcus Dysch thinks it is a mistake for Labour to reignite the Naz Shah story just before PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn has just issued a statement about Naz Shah. But he has not said he is withdrawing the whip from her, suggesting he will not take Lisa Nandy’s advice on this. What Naz Shah did was offensive and unacceptable. I have spoken to her and made this clear. These are historic social media posts made before she was a Member of Parliament. Naz has issued a fulsome apology. She does not hold these views and accepts she was completely wrong to have made these posts. The Labour Party is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism. On the Daily Politics Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, has just said she thinks the Labour MP Naz Shah should be suspended from the party (ie, lose the Labour whip) pending an investigation into her pre-election Facebook posts. Nandy said that was the party’s procedure for anyone accused of anti-semitism, and that Shah should not be exempt. In Scotland Kezia Dugdale, Labour’s Scottish leader, has been launching her party’s manifesto for the Holyrood elections next week. My colleague Severin Carrell published an interview with her yesterday. Here it is. Here’s an extract. Now she is finding “genuine warmth”, Dugdale said, on the campaign trail. Voters, she believes, like the fact that Labour is openly fighting for higher taxes on the rich, campaigning for a 50p top income tax rate in Scotland. So too do Labour activists. “When I compare that to the sentiment during the general election, the mood has changed,” she said. “There’s a sense now that the anger has dissipated. People really like the tax policy. They like the honesty of it. They like the simple recognition that we now have the power to do things differently.” Dugdale and her colleagues point to several seats they hope to hold or even win back from the SNP – despite the pessimism which grips Labour at national level. Given its dire standing in the polls and last year’s annihilation, winning four or five constituencies would be seen as a good result, as long as Labour comes second overall. And here are some tweets from Sev from the manifesto launch this morning. And here are some quotes from the speech Angel Gurria, the OECD secretary general, gave at the news conference this morning where he published the OECD’s Brexit report. Gurria said Brexit would effectively impose a permanent tax on Britons. Brexit would, rather like a tax, hit the wellbeing and the pockets of UK citizens. Unlike most taxes, however, this one will not finance the provision of public services or close the fiscal gap. The “Brexit tax” would be a pure deadweight loss, a cost incurred with no economic benefit. And this tax would not be a one-off levy. Britons would be paying it for many years. He said Britons were already paying the “Brexit tax” because of the economic impact of the uncertainty generated by the EU referendum. Our estimates are too cautious. For one thing, they focus entirely on future effects, whereas in fact the first payments of the “Brexit tax” are already being made. Just this morning, the Office for National Statistics announced the lowest quarterly GDP growth figures since 2012. And already in the previous quarter, business investment was weak as the Brexit issue gained prominence. Brexit costs can also be seen in financial markets. Since the autumn, the pound has weakened against the euro and the dollar, and the cost of insuring against exchange rate volatility has risen significantly. The costs are piling up, and we are still two months away from the referendum! John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says today’s growth figures (see 9.42am) confirm the need for the government to invest more. In a statement he said: There is clearly a growing Tory threat to our economy, whether from the Conservative backbenchers screaming for Brexit despite the mounting evidence against the case, or a Tory chancellor who is also refusing to listen to the expanding coalition of international organisations that not only warn of the risks of Brexit, but also the risks of his policy of under investing in our economy. It is vital for the UK that George Osborne listens to the expert advice telling him not only that we must stay in the EU, but also that he must not starve our economy of investment any longer. Labour would not stand by when we see a recovery built on sand due to George Osborne’s failure, we would stand up for jobs and growth by setting realistic targets to get rid of the deficit on day-to-day spending whilst allowing government the capacity to invest in the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future. And here is another OECD chart, from its news release. It shows that, under the OECD’s most pessimistic scenario, Brexit could lead to GDP being almost 8% lower by 2030 than it otherwise would be, equivalent to a cost per household of £5,000. Here is the OECD report (pdf). And here is the key chart it contains. It shows the impact of Brexit on growth and the equivalent cost per household in pounds (GBP), in the near term (by 2020) and in the long term (by 2030). There are three long term forecasts, a central one, a pessimistic one and an optimistic one. The OECD report is now out. Here is Larry Elliott’s story about it. And here is how it starts. The west’s leading economics thinktank has warned that a British decision to leave the EU in this summer’s referendum would cost each household £2,200 by the end of a decade and continue to impose “a persistent and rising shock” on the UK in the following years. Adding its voice to negative assessments by the Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a so-called Brexit vote on 23 June would provide a major negative shock to Britain and have ripple effects on the rest of Europe. “In some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU,” the OECD said. The OECD’s policy paper said that even before the EU’s formal departure from the EU, which the thinktank assumes would happen in late 2018, the UK would be hit by weaker confidence and more expensive credit. Once the terms of a divorce settlement had been agreed, Britain would face higher trade barriers and feel the early impact of restrictions on immigration. “By 2020, GDP would be over 3% smaller than otherwise (with continued EU membership), equivalent to a cost per household of £2,200 (in today’s prices),” the OECD added. The rest of the EU would see GDP shaved by one percentage point by the decade’s end. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. If Lord Patten is worried about the BBC becoming “excessively deferential” to Leave, he will have been heartened by this interview, because Nick Robinson gave Farage quite a hard time. Farage dismissed the OECD claims about the impact of Brexit - but failed to name a single economic organisation saying Britain would be better off if it left the EU. Here is the key exchange, starting with what Farage (NF) said to Robinson (NR) when asked about the OECD conclusions. NF: Yeah, yeah, yeah: IMF, OECD, a whole series of international organisations stuffed full of overpaid people who failed in politics mostly. NR: Would you like to give us a list of the organisations that agree with you, because it would be very useful to have them. NF: Yeah, they’re called markets, they’re called consumers, they’re called people. And they are called the real world. NR: Can you name an organisation of economic forecasters, private or public, that agrees with your view that you would be better off outside the EU. NF: I’m in Cardiff. The professor of economics at Cardiff University, Patrick Minford, said very clearly that outside the European Union the average British family would be £40 a week better off. NR: He’s one individual, Mr Farage. He’s not an organisation. He’s not an international body. NF: Well, of course. These international bodies, there is virtually nobody working for any of them that has manufactured a good or traded a product globally. I did that for 20 years before getting into politics. And the fact is, whether we are in the European Union or outside the European Union, we’ll go on buying and selling goods between France and Germany and Britain and Italy because ultimately markets aren’t created by politicians. It’s about consumers making choices. Farage refused to say what model he thought the UK should follow in terms of negotiating a trade deal with the EU. The UK would create its own model, he said. I would like to have a relationship like the eurozone’s biggest export market in the world, the market they need more than any other to have as free as access to as possible. If little countries like Norway and Switzerland can get their own deals, then we can have a bespoke British deal that suits us. When it was put to him that Norway and Switzerland had to accept free movement as part of their free trade deal, he said they had been betrayed by their leaders. They’ve been betrayed by their politicians in both Norway and Switzerland and then they’re rebelling against that. He claimed that he was not involved in the Ukip’s decision to suspend Suzanne Evans - although he also refused to say that he wanted her reinstated. Asked if it was his decision to suspend her, he replied: I’m party leader, I tour the country, I try and raise money, I try and get the party coverage, I try and enthuse the troops, I don’t deal with discipline of candidate selection and I never have done. Then, asked if he wanted her back, he replied: I don’t think she behaved terribly well, so. I don’t think she behaved terribly well. She’s suspended for a short period of time. He downplayed the controversy in Wales about Ukip candidate selections. We may have some discussions about who should and should not be candidates in winnable positions but I look at the Conservative party, which is literally ripping itself to pieces, and the Labour party where over 80% of the MPs don’t want Corbyn as leader, I look at their problems and I think, what I’ve got is nothing. He claimed that Ukip was the only party with a chance of winning candidates in the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly, the London assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly. For me, the big goal on May 5th is to win representation in the London assembly, the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Irish assembly, and I think I’m the only party leader who’s got a chance of winning seats in all four of them. This is a hollow boast because Labour and the Lib Dems do not officially put up candidates in Northern Ireland (although Labour has some unofficial candidates standing), and the Conservatives (who for years never stood in Northern Ireland) only have about a couple of candidates standing. And the chances of Ukip winning any seats are thought to be slim. And here is Chris Giles, the Financial Times’s economics editor, on the growth figures. Here is George Osborne, the chancellor, on the growth figures. The first quarter growth figure is out. The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of 2016, down from 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, the ONS says. Here is the ONS statistical bulletin with the full details. On the Today programme Lord Patten, a former European commissioner and a former chair of the BBC Trust, was interviewed about the EU referendum. As you’d expect, he’s strongly in favour of Remain. But he also said he thought the BBC was being “excessively deferential” to the pro-Brexit case. He told the programme: The BBC has an extremely difficult job. It is having to cover this referendum with the shadow of a charter review and [John Whittingdale, the culture secretary] hanging over it. I think that may make people excessively deferential when trying to produce balance. You have the governor of the Bank of England on, or the IMF chief, so you feel obliged to put up some Conservative backbencher that nobody has ever heard of on the other side of the argument. It does occasionally raise eyebrows. But I think I would prefer the BBC to be being criticised for being excessively balanced rather than for doing anything else. It is a very great broadcaster which is dedicated to telling the truth and that is an unusual thing in the world of the media. The OEC secretary general is known as Angel Gurria, but his formal name is Jose Angel Gurria and that was the name Vote Leave used in its news release. I left out the Jose when quoting their statement for the sake of consistency. But I can now see why Vote Leave included it. It was so they could use the #NoWayJose hashtag. Vote Leave has issued a statement rejecting the OECD claims, saying the organisation is “in the pay of the EU”. This is from Robert Oxley, a Vote Leave spokesman. The OECD is in the pay of the EU. Angel Gurría is part of a global bureaucracy that feathers its nest with vast expenses claims paid for by taxpayers. OECD officials themselves avoid paying tax in most countries - he is in no place to lecture us about taxes. The OECD said that the UK would receive “great benefits” from joining the ERM. It recommended that we should join the euro. So why should we listen to their doom-laden predictions about leaving the EU? After Vote Leave and take back control we will be able to cut our tax bill because we will no longer have to fund overpaid and under taxed international bureaucrats in Brussels. This will be bad for fat cat officials but good for the British people. Vote Leave says the OECD received €30m from the EU between 2007 and 2014. Angel Gurria may not be as well known in the UK as Barack Obama but his intervention in the EU debate - which has come today - may be almost as powerful as the US president’s. Gurria is secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the pro-trade body representing 34 of the world’s richest countries, and it is publishing a report today on the impact of Brexit. It seems it is going to be even more blunt about the disadvantages of leaving the EU than the Treasury’s own report was, because the OECD is saying Brexit would effectively cost Britons a month’s salary by 2020. At least, that is what Gurria said when he was interviewed on the Today programme earlier. He said: Brexit is like a tax. It is the equivalent to roughly missing out on about one month’s income within four years but then it carries on to 2030. That tax is going to be continued to be paid by Britons over time. In comparison with a baseline scenario [for UK growth] they would otherwise have had in their pocket, in hand, to spend, they will not have - therefore it is as powerful, as real, as a tax or as if you would just give it over to somebody. We have done the comparisons, we have done the simulations. In the end we come out and say: why are we spending so much time, so much effort and so much talent in trying to find ways to compensate for a bad decision when you do not necessarily have to take the bad decision? Gurria also said that the Leave camp were wrong to think the UK could get better trade deals outside the EU. There is absolutely no reason why you would get a sweeter trade deal than you already have, no reason why you would have a sweeter investment deal. I will post more on this this morning. 9.30am: The ONS publishes its first quarter growth figure. 9.30am: Lady Altmann, the pensions minister, gives evidence to the work and pensions committee on intergenerational fairness. 10.30am: The OECD publishes its report on the economic consequences of Brexit. 10.30am: The Conservative MP James Cleverly gives a Vote Leave speech on the impact of the common agricultural policy on African farmers. 10.30am: Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief Justice, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee. 10.30am: Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, launches her party’s election manifesto. 12pm: David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Theresa May, the home secretary, makes a Commons statement on Hillsborough. 2.15pm: Arron Banks and Richard Tice, the founders of Leave.EU, give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the EU referendum. 2.30pm: Nicky Morgan, the education committee, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. I will be focusing in particular on PMQs, the Hillsborough statement and then, probably, the Treasury committee hearing, but as usual I will also be covering other breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

Protestors chaining themselves to the gates of the first new indigenous source of fossil fuel since the North Sea oil discoveries. Warnings of power blackouts within three to five years from the government's top energy official and energy company bosses. An ageing fleet of nuclear power stations and a damaging stand-off over the site of the only new reactor yet in planning. A dearth of investment in crucial infrastructure. The UK's energy sector has not faced such an extraordinary combination of dire problems since the crises of the 1970s – and even then help was on the horizon in the form of North Sea oil and gas. Policy interventions by government will be vital to solving the multiple looming difficulties and encouraging the massive investment needed from the private sector. But time is running out. The UK's remaining coal-fired power stations are having to reduce their hours of operation – under European Union regulations on pollution – so replacing that capacity is a matter of urgency. A challenging future landscape Baroness Verma, UK energy minister, acknowledged that the UK was facing \"a number of unprecedented challenges\" – not least that electricity use is set to rise as we use more power for heating and transport – but said that government plans laid out in this year's energy bill would set the framework for increasing energy generation. She forecast that the measures would bring about investment of £110bn by the end of this decade. She said: \"Electricity Market Reform [EMR] provides support for low-carbon technologies in the short to medium term, in order to work towards a long-term vision. This vision is of a competitive market in which all technologies participate on a level playing field, without financial support.\" Under EMR, energy suppliers will be able to enter into long-term contracts and will be supported by \"capacity payments\", by which generators will guarantee to have enough power at hand to provide for peaks in demand, and \"contracts for difference\" by which low-carbon energy generation will receive a premium over high-carbon fuels. Key details of how some of these mechanisms will work were set out over the summer, including the \"strike price\" on contracts for difference for various forms of renewable power, but some details remain unresolved. These include exactly how the capacity market will work in practice, and the strike price for nuclear power at EDF's proposed new reactor at Hinkley Point. The latter has been the subject of a tense stand-off between the Treasury and the French state-owned utility, with the government taking the view that EDF's current demands for price assurances are too costly to the consumer. Kickstarting UK investment Key to the government's thinking on energy policy is the need to moderate fuel prices for consumers. Baroness Verma told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group: \"The coalition is determined to help consumers with the rising cost of living. Our current Electricity Market Reform proposals are set to deliver the affordable energy bills, cleaner energy and reliable supplies that we need.\" So far, however, the energy industry remains to be convinced, and investors have been slow to come forward. Plans to convert the Tilbury power station to biomass were shelved over the summer, offshore wind construction has not kept pace with forecasts, and there is currently only one new gas-fired power station under construction in the UK. Industry insiders are sceptical that the government can provide sufficient reassurances in the short term to kickstart the massive sums needed over the next few years. Another issue is the heavy reliance of the UK energy sector on overseas utilities: with Germany undergoing its Energiewende and France and Spain in financial difficulties, these companies are likely to concentrate their efforts on their home markets with less investment and management time available for the UK, analysts fear. This uncertainty is affecting the wider economy, too. Manufacturers are concerned about the future of power supplies, and about the cost. Jeremy Nicholson of the Energy Intensive Users Group pointed to plans by the National Grid to offer incentives to companies to cut their power use at peak times and run their systems instead at night or other times of lower demand. This could affect manufacturing capacity, he said. Meanwhile, British and European manufacturers are suffering from the advantages that US companies have tapped through the bonanza in shale gas and oil. Gas prices have plummeted, more electricity across the US is now coming from gas rather than coal, and manufacturers are reaping the rewards in undercutting their overseas rivals. Fracking: economy vs environment For some in the government, the example of the US offers a lifeline out of the current energy muddle. Shale gas exists in vast quantities in geological formations in the north of England, and may extend over much more of the country, recent geological analysis has found. There could be enough to meet the UK's needs for decades, if estimates are correct. However, the key questions are: can it be extracted at economically viable rates and without doing serious environmental damage? In the US, shale gas extraction has been associated with air and water pollution, the despoliation of the landscape and the over-use of water that has left some communities high and dry. Protesters against shale in the UK also argue that it will increase greenhouse gas emissions, through the use of the gas and the flaring of methane that will happen at some sites. A Guardian poll found 40% of voters against shale gas exploitation in their area and 40% in favour, with the rest undecided. The government, however, is determined to press ahead, with energy secretary Ed Davey setting out the case for shale this week and the chancellor, George Osborne, offering substantial tax breaks to the industry, as well as promising at least £100,000 for each community affected and 1% of the revenues. What are the alternatives? Renewable companies are looking on with trepidation. While RenewableUK and other industry bodies insist that gas can be a transition technology on the road to renewables, sections of the coalition government are touting shale gas as an alternative – and cheaper – investment than wind, solar or other renewables. The economics of this may be questionable, but the argument has found a popular resonance. New plans by the environment secretary Owen Paterson to investigate whether onshore wind farms have an effect on nearby house prices show which way the wind is blowing in some quarters. Added to that, the government is firmly opposing in Brussels proposals for a new renewable target for 2030, to take over from the current 2020 target to generate 20% of energy from renewable. With a year and a half of the current coalition government to go, and new details set to emerge soon of EMR and EU policy – to say nothing of continuing UN negotiations on climate change, set to culminate in 2015 – the coming months will be crucial in determining the UK's energy future for years to come. Energy policy will remain at the centre of government thinking and for the UK's industrial and investment sectors, but the intractable problems of how to generate more electricity more cheaply and with less carbon will not be solved in the short term.

As workers continued efforts to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Kan said he would \"start from scratch\" a policy that initially envisaged nuclear making up more than 50% of Japan's energy needs by 2030. Japan, whose 54 nuclear reactors provide 30% of its electricity, had planned to build at least 14 new reactors over the next 20 years, but policymakers accept that will be impossible in light of the Fukushima crisis. Kan said that renewables, which make up 20% of overall supply, would have a bigger role to play in meeting the country's energy needs. \"I think it is necessary to move in the direction of promoting natural energy and renewable energy such as wind, solar and biomass,\" he said. The stronger commitment to renewables marks Kan's second sudden shift on nuclear power in the space of a week following his order to close the Hamaoka atomic plant, which sits on an active fault line, while a new tsunami wall is built. Confronted with low approval ratings and criticism of his handling of the nuclear crisis from inside his own party, the prime minister's public commitment to nuclear power has markedly weakened in recent days. But Kan, who will not take his salary until the Fukushima crisis is resolved, said Japan would retain the use of fossil fuel and ruled out an abandonment of nuclear power. \"We need to start from scratch,\" he said. \"We need to make nuclear energy safer and do more to promote renewable energy.\" He added: \"I believe the government bears a major responsibility for having promoted nuclear energy as national policy. I apologise to the people for failing to prevent the nuclear accident.\" His announcement came as the first of tens of thousands of nuclear evacuees were allowed to return home for two hours to collect clothes and other personal items. About 100 residents of Kawauchi village – a small portion of those who will make similar trips in the coming weeks – were each permitted to fill one large bag with belongings. Dressed in protective suits, goggles and facemasks, the residents were given personal radiation monitors and walkie-talkies as they made their short but emotional return home for the first time in weeks. They were taken out of the zone on chartered government buses and screened for radiation exposure. About 80,000 people within 20km of the Fukushima Daiichi plant were forced out of their homes by the accident and have yet to be told when they will be able to return permanently. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has vowed to stabilise radiation levels and achieve safe \"cold shutdown\" of the plant's damaged reactors within six to nine months. In the past few days, workers have entered the No 1 reactor building to start reconnecting cooling systems knocked out by the tsunami. On Tuesday they were preparing to flood the reactor's containment vessel to immerse overheating fuel rods in cool water. Tepco sought to calm fears about rising temperatures in the No 3 reactor, releasing an image showing fuel rods covered with debris from hydrogen explosions in March. The firm said it believed the fuel rods, some of which contain plutonium, had been largely undamaged. On Wednesday, Tepco said it would accept the conditions for state support for a massive compensation payout for those deprived of their homes and businesses by the Fukushima accident. The utility, which has seen its market value plummet since the disaster, accepted there should be no upper limit on damages that could reach 10 trillion yen. It must also dramatically cut costs and cooperate with an investigation by a government-appointed panel. The government is considering setting up a fund that would draw on cash from the state and other power companies if Tepco were unable to cover all of the compensation claims itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/04/french-nuclear-power-plant-explosion-safety-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-04T10:07:15Z","webTitle":"French nuclear power plant explosion heightens safety fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/french-nuclear-power-plant-explosion-safety-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/04/french-nuclear-power-plant-explosion-safety-fears","fields":{"headline":"French nuclear power plant explosion heightens safety fears","bodyText":"An explosion sparked a fire at a French nuclear power station on Saturday, just two days after the authorities found 32 safety concerns at the plant. The blaze at the Tricastin plant in Drôme in the Rhône valley sent a thick cloud of black smoke into the sky. A mistral wind sent it south over a nearby motorway on one of the busiest travel days of the year as the French left for their summer holidays. EDF, which runs the power station, said the incident took place in an electric transformer situated in the non-nuclear part of the plant and had not resulted in any radiation leak or any other contamination. A statement issued by the energy giant raised further concerns as it omitted to mention the explosion – only a fire – and did not give the cause of the blaze. \"This event happened in the non-nuclear part of the installation and had no radiological consequence on the environment and the population. The fire brigade was immediately called and the fire was rapidly brought under control. Nobody was hurt,\" it said. EDF added that the plant's number one reactor was not in operation at the time of the fire, having been \"closed for its annual maintenance\". Police confirmed there was no environmental contamination. On Thursday France's nuclear safety authority, the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN), demanded 32 safety measures at the Tricastin number one reactor, a 900MW water pressurised reactor built in 1974 and put into operation in 1980. In 2007 an ASN report had concluded that \"the site must make improvements in management and training\" and criticised the plant's procedure for dealing with fires as \"taking too long\". The following year uranium leaked from the number two reactor at Tricastin during a cleaning operation and contaminated local rivers. Swimming and fishing were banned as a precaution. Although one of the oldest reactors in use in France, the ASN agreed last year that Tricastin's working life could be extended for another decade. The safety measures revealed last week include greater protection against fire, flooding and earthquakes, including improvements to the methods of cooling of the nuclear fuel rods in order to lessen the risk of an explosion of hydrogen at the heart of the reactor. The ASN said the faults in the reactor were \"known and under surveillance\" and ordered that the new safety measures should be completed before December 2014. A week ago the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, bucked the anti-nuclear trend sweeping Europe since the Fukushima disaster by pledging €1bn of investment in atomic power as well as \"substantial resources\" to strengthen research into nuclear safety. France has 58 nuclear reactors, 34 of which are reactors of the type at Tricastin and have an average age of 28 years. About 74% of the country's electricity comes from nuclear sources and it is the world's largest net exporter of nuclear energy. Sarkozy said France was known to be \"considerably ahead\" of other countries in terms of atomic power technology and safety. \"Our power stations are more expensive because they are safer,\" he said last week. After the Fukushima nuclear accidents in March, caused by a combination of earthquake and tsunami, the French prime minister, François Fillon, asked the ASN to carry out an \"open and transparent\" audit of the country's nuclear installations, examining the risks of flood and earthquake damage, loss of power and cooling, and emergency accident procedure, to examine if any improvements could be made. Its conclusions are expected in September.

Despite growing worldwide concern about the safety of nuclear plants, Sarkozy said the moratorium on new nuclear reactors adopted by certain countries since the Japanese nuclear crisis in March \"makes no sense\". \"There is no alternative to nuclear energy today,\" he told journalists on Monday. \"We are going to devote €1bn to the nuclear programme of the future, particularly fourth-generation technology,\" Sarkozy said. Sarkozy also promised \"substantial resources\" to strengthen research into nuclear safety and a further €1.3bn (£1.2bn) investment in renewable energy. The announcement confirming France's commitment to atomic power came as neighbouring Germany drew up plans to shut all its nuclear stations by 2022. It also came 24 hours after thousands of anti-nuclear protesters formed a human chain outside France's oldest nuclear power station to demand its closure. The plant at Fessenheim in Alsace, on France's border with Germany, has become the focus of a fierce debate over nuclear safety. At the weekend, demonstrators from France, Germany and Switzerland surrounded the plant calling for its number one reactor, in operation since 1977, to be taken out of service, claiming it was vulnerable to flooding and earthquakes. The plant is operated by French power group EDF. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, announced in May that Germany would phase out its 17 nuclear reactors, which provide up to 23% of the country's energy, by 2022 at a cost of €40bn. She said Germany would concentrate on renewable energy sources. \"We want to end the use of nuclear energy and reach the age of renewable energy as fast as possible,\" Merkel said. Switzerland has also decided not to replace its five existing nuclear reactors, which supply around 40% of its energy, when they reach the end of their working life. The last of the nuclear stations is expected to end production by 2034, leaving time for Switzerland to develop alternative power sources. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, sought to restart his country's nuclear programme, abandoned in the 1980s. But 94% of Italian voters rejected the idea in a referendum earlier this month. France has 58 nuclear reactors, which supply 74% of its electricity, and is the world's largest net exporter of electricity from nuclear sources. Sarkozy said France was known to be \"considerably ahead\" of other countries in terms of atomic power technology and safety. \"Our power stations are more expensive because they are safer,\" he said. Following the Fukushima nuclear accidents, caused by a combination of earthquake and tsunami, the French prime minister, François Fillon, asked the nuclear safety authority to carry out an \"open and transparent\" audit of the country's nuclear installations, examining the risks of flood and earthquake damage, loss of power and cooling, and emergency accident procedure, to examine if any improvements could be made. Its conclusions are expected in September. All 143 working nuclear power plants in the EU's 27 member states are facing new safety tests in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. French ecology minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said no decision on the future of Fessenheim would be made before the nuclear safety watchdog submitted its report. • This article was amended on 29 June 2011.

But what if that message warns we might want to rethink that whole fossil fuel burning thing pretty quick because it could seriously alter civilization and the natural world for centuries to come, and not in a good way? Time to get the bullets out and start firing, obviously. Climate scientists have been trying to dodge, catch or deflect those bullets for decades. They are now all too used to being shot at, kicked and maligned as their findings are misunderstood, misrepresented, trivialised or booted around like footballs between politicians and other warring ideological factions and self-interested industry groups. But if they had to pick one thing, what is it that really gets them annoyed? When the public tries to understand the implications of their scientific findings – or just understand the findings themselves – what’s the most common mistake they see? When the media gets hold of their findings, what makes climate scientists chuck a shoe, ice core or physics textbook at the screen in frustration? I decided to ask a few leading climate scientists from around the globe to articulate that one thing that leaves them totally tacked off. Some struggled to pick only a single bugbear (one even called to apologise for taking too long, so spoilt for choice were they), others took the chance to uncompromisingly unload their frustrations. Here’s what they had to say. Professor Andrew Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney Many people who would not dream to claim they understand how antibiotics, microprocessors or immunisations work seem happy to wax lyrical on their views on climate change. A politician or media identity who would be laughed out of office if they said “vaccines don't work\" or “I am certain the moon is made of cheese\" happily speak equivalent rubbish on climate science, believing their views deserve credit. I want engineers to build bridges; I want a trained surgeon to operate on hearts and I want some of our decision-makers and commentators to either shut up, or familiarise themselves with climate science well enough to talk sense. Professor Michael Mann, director of Penn State Earth System Science Center, United States If there’s one concept that is typically misrepresented in the public discourse on climate change, it is the concept of uncertainty. There are uncertainties in model projections of future climate change. However, these uncertainties cut both ways, and in many cases it appears that model projections have underestimated the rate and magnitude of the climate changes resulting from our burning of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The rapid lost of Arctic sea ice is one such example. Rather than being cause for inaction, uncertainty is a reason to act all the sooner. Professor Michael Raupach, director of the Climate Change Institute, Australian National University, Canberra The greatest cause for sorrow is the widespread inability of the public discussion to recognise the whole picture. Much of the political discourse reduces the complexities of climate change to political football (“axe the tax”); much media reporting sees only the hook to today’s passing story; many interest groups want to use climate change to proselytise for their particular get-out-of-jail free card (nuclear power, carbon farming). All of this misses or trivialises the real, systemic significance of climate change: that humankind is encountering the finitude of our planet, confronting the need to share and protect our endowment from nature, and realising that much will have to change to make this possible. Professor Richard Betts, chair in Climate Impacts at the College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, UK The thing that bugs me most about the way climate change is talked about in the media is journalists citing scientific papers without providing a link to the original paper. Readers often want to get more details or simply check sources, but this is very difficult (or sometimes impossible) if the source is not given. I've raised this a few times, and get lame excuses like 'readers get frustrated when the journals are paywalled' but that's not good enough. Media should provide sources – end of. Professor Steven Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Sydney Where to start? These are things I don’t see (or don’t see enough). First is still that, even though it is clear greenhouse gas emissions raise the temperature of the Earth, we’ve known this for 50+ years and no reputable atmospheric scientist in the world disputes this, most people think scientists disagree. They’ve been misled by the media, and I’ve been told repeatedly by reporters in the US and Australia that this is due to pressure from management. Second is the fact that carbon dioxide emissions are effectively irreversible and will stay in the climate system for hundreds of generations is seldom noted. If we decide later that this was a huge mistake there is no going back (practically speaking). On the political side, I wish the media would note the obvious parallels of the carbon debate with past ones over restricting pollutants (mercury, lead, asbestos, CFCs), where claims that restrictions would be economically catastrophic never came true. These are things I do see that bug me. One would be phrases like “action on climate change”. We should be talking about “action on carbon dioxide” — and climate is only one reason (albeit the biggest) that too much of it is dangerous. Nothing we do with respect to any other influence on climate will prevent global warming if CO2 keeps climbing. Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth System Analysis, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany One of the phrases that makes me cringe is when I read in the media that a particular extreme weather event \"is no evidence for climate change\". This is so bad it's not even wrong, but it is quite misleading. Climate change is a measured fact seen in rising temperatures, vanishing ice, rising sea levels etc. - it needs no further evidence. And a single extreme event cannot possibly provide such evidence, because climate change increases the number of certain extremes. Some, like heat waves, have already increased massively thanks to global warming. Professor Roger Jones, research fellow at the Centre for Strategic and Economic Studies at Victoria University, Melbourne Who am I? I can be sued for calling a public individual fraudulent but not a whole scientific community or organisation – because climate scientists and the IPCC are fraudulent. I can publish proven lies in my newspaper day after day with no penalty. I can buy disaffected scientists to deny sound science with a plane fare to a bogus conference and a little publicity. I can anonymously threaten researchers online, especially the female ones. If anyone threatens me with facts, I can call them an antidemocratic, anti-jobs, McCarthyist, communist, anti-freedom, pagan environmentalist. Everyone says there is no consensus. I deny everything. Dr Sophie Lewis, research fellow in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne I get annoyed when I hear yet another politician arguing that we can’t link extreme events to climate change. You know the spurious reasoning? Australia’s always had heatwaves/floods/fires, so this recent extreme is nothing to worry about. When I hear this, it’s time to turn off the TV. Climate scientists don’t just guess at what contributed to recent extremes. We methodically calculate changes in the risk of extremes due to human factors, like greenhouse gases. I don’t just get irate out of principle. Dismissing the link between climate change and extremes as hogwash leaves us vulnerable to a warmer climate. Dr Andrew Glikson, visiting fellow at the School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University I think the scale of the changes being seen now when compared to the Earth's history is something the media and the public do not appreciate. Earth's history is marked by a number of major mass extinctions of species, triggered by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and release of methane from sediments. Major shifts in the state of the climate were caused either by pulsations in solar radiation or by release of carbon from the Earth. In each of these events a marked rise occurred in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As the level of energy and temperature of the atmosphere increased, irreversible tipping points were reached where the synergy of feedback processes – ice melt, warming water, released methane, droughts and fires - combined to shift the climate from one state to the next. The current rise in energy of the atmosphere above that of pre-industrial times, by about 3 Watt per square meter, is about half that of the atmospheric energy rise during the last transition from glacial to interglacial state. The current shift is threatening to bring about irreversible tipping points in the climate, with the most serious consequences, likely indicated by the increase over the last 20 years or so in the intensity of extreme weather events around the globe. The current rise of atmospheric CO2 at a rate of near-three parts per million per year exceeds rates recorded in the history of the atmosphere for the last 55 million years, which retards the ability of species to adapt to environmental change in time. A consequent shift from conditions, which have allowed agriculture to take place from about 8,000 years ago, would render large parts of the continents unsuitable for cultivation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/nov/30/david-cameron-distance-britain-dalai-lama-china-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-30T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"David Cameron to distance Britain from Dalai Lama during China visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/30/david-cameron-distance-britain-dalai-lama-china-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/nov/30/david-cameron-distance-britain-dalai-lama-china-visit","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron to distance Britain from Dalai Lama during China visit","bodyText":"David Cameron will distance Britain from the Dalai Lama during a trip to China next week as the price for restoring full business and diplomatic relations with Beijing. The changed stance is the result of an internal Whitehall debate on the best approach to Tibet and China that was won by the chancellor, George Osborne. As the Free Tibet group called on the prime minister to raise the issue of human rights in Tibet, Downing Street sources said Britain has \"turned a page\" on the Dalai Lama and Cameron has no plans to meet him in the foreseeable future. A No 10 source said: \"This visit is forward looking. We have turned a page on that issue. It is about the future and how we want to shift UK-China relations up a gear.\" The stark message came as the prime minister prepares to meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, who were installed in March, on a delayed visit to China next week. The prime minister was forced to abandon a visit to China in April after Beijing indicated that the main Communist leadership were unlikely to be available. The move was officially explained by the need for the new leadership to bed down a month after the transfer of power, but was widely seen as a deliberate diplomatic snub. It was understood that Beijing wanted to show its displeasure after Cameron and Nick Clegg met the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, at St Paul's Cathedral in May 2012. The snub prompted intense discussion at the highest levels in Whitehall over Britain's relations with China. The chancellor told a group of ministers at a private gathering attended by Cameron that Britain's relationship with China was of such economic and geopolitical significance that it could not allow British sensitivities over human rights to complicate matters. It is understood that the Foreign Office was keen for Britain to tread with care. Osborne triumphed in the discussions and led a five-day trade mission to China last month which paved the way for Beijing to invest in Britain's new generation of nuclear power plants. The prime minister listened carefully to the cautious Foreign Office voices but will heed Osborne's advice when he declines to raise the issue of the Dalai Lama and Tibet in Beijing. Downing Street declined to say whether he would challenge the Chinese leadership on human rights in the rest of China. European leaders tend to have a delphic mechanism for dealing with human rights in which they refer to an established dialogue on the issue which is then handled by lowly officials on the Chinese side. Asked whether human rights would be raised, a No 10 source said: \"We have a broad ranging relationship with China where we discuss a lot of issues. Nothing is off the table. If you look at the prime minister's visits and his bilateral meetings here human rights is an issue we discuss.\" Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"David Cameron may now claim to be opening a new chapter with China, but in truth this visit is an attempt to make up a lot of lost ground. He came to office saying strengthening the UK's relationship with China would be a top foreign policy priority, but his lack of diplomatic skill has put the UK-China relationship in the deep freeze for the last three years.\" Downing Street believes the visit is taking place at a crucial time after the Chinese leadership unveiled a major expansion of economic freedoms. But the visit may be overshadowed by the dispute between Japan and China over the disputed Senkaku island. The prime minister will find himself in China at the same time as the US vice president Joe Biden who begins a visit to the region on Sunday. An ICM poll commissioned by the Free Tibet group found that 69% of those questioned believe it is as important or more important for human rights to be protected in Tibet as it is to maintain good relations with China. Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren, the group's director, said: \"George Osborne may not have stood up for human rights and Tibet during his recent visit, but it's absolutely clear that the British public expect Mr Cameron to do better. He was willing to raise human rights in Sri Lanka just days ago and he needs to show that Britain's principles are not dependent on the wealth of his host. It's clear from this poll that only a handful of British people believe trade with China is more important than human rights in Tibet and that they expect Mr Cameron to act like a statesman, not a salesman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/23/europe-failed-learn-environmental-lessons","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Europe 'has failed to learn from environmental disasters'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/23/europe-failed-learn-environmental-lessons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/23/europe-failed-learn-environmental-lessons","fields":{"headline":"Europe 'has failed to learn from environmental disasters'","bodyText":"Europe has failed to learn the lessons from many environmental and health disasters like Chernobyl, leaded petrol and DDT insecticides, and is now ignoring warnings about bee deaths, GM food and nanotechnology, according to an 800-page report by the European Environment Agency. Thousands of lives could have been saved and extensive damage to ecosystems avoided if the \"precautionary principle\" had been applied on the basis of early warnings, say the authors of the 2013 Late Lessons from Early warnings report published on Wednesday. They accuse industry of working to corrupt or undermine regulation by spinning and manipulating research and applying pressure on governments for financial benefit. \"[It has] deliberately recruited reputable scientists, media experts and politicians to call on if their products were linked to possible hazards. Manufacturing doubt, disregarding scientific evidence of risks and claiming over-regulation appear to be a deliberate strategy for some industry groups and think tanks to undermine precautionary decision-making.\" The peer-reviewed study, which is aimed to improve understanding of scientific information, looks at 18 areas including radiation from mobile phones, birth control pills in the aquatic environment, and invasive species. It found that governments often introduced laws much too late to prevent deaths and massive financial costs, but were highly likely to ignore scientific warnings and resist any regulation. The authors found more than 80 cases where no regulation was introduced when it later turned out that the risk from a technology or chemical was real, or still unproven. Nuclear power The study says the Fukushima disaster in 2011 may have released twice as much radiation as the Japanese government admitted. The emissions of radioactive caesium-137 from Fukushima are said to have started earlier than the authorities have claimed, to have lasted longer, and to have spread over a wider area of land than previously believed. The authors say that it is far too early to make any responsible estimate of the potential health impact of the Fukushima disaster. The report reopens the controversy between pro- and anti- nuclear power advocates about the health damage from in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. While the World Health Organisation has claimed that only 28 people died and there could be a possible 4,000 additional cancer deaths , the EU study states that the numbers of deaths could range from \"at least 17,000 to 68,000 over 50 years\". In a sharp rebuke to pro-nuclear advocates who have argued that the accident produced very few extra cancers, it argues that it is wrong to focus solely on cancer as an outcome of Chernobyl. \"Post-Chernobyl non-cancer impact may be very great, including immunological disorders, and cardiovascular disease - especially among the young,\" it says. Reactor accidents are said to be by far the single largest risk now facing the nuclear industry. According to the study, the probability of a future major nuclear accident has increased 20-fold since Fukushima An urgent re-appraisal of the way that nuclear power stations are assessed for safety is long overdue, says the study. \"Whatever one's view of the risks and benefits of nuclear energy, it is clear that the possibility of catastrophic accidents must be factored into the policy and regulatory decision-making process. Both the regulation of operating nuclear reactors and the design-base for any proposed reactor will need significant re-evaluation.\" Genetically modified food and crops The report also says that GM crops provide no direct benefit to consumers, are over-hyped, not necessarily safe and are largely unsuitable for the great majority of the world's farmers. It argues that \"top-down\" GM companies cynically manipulate the international patent and subsidy systems to gain maximum returns. \"Modifying genotypes and capturing them as [intellectual property] through plant variety protection and patents is a far easier means of capturing financial benefits than attempting to [innovate] with cover crops, rotation schedules and composting, farmer-initiated training and education and small scale marketing and credit programs,\" it says. The study compares the potential of high-input GM farming with that of low-tech \"agro-ecological\" methods increasingly employed by small farmers in developing countries, and argues that the risks of GM are downplayed and its benefits overplayed. \"Evidence is accumulating of inflated benefit claims and of adverse effects. The benefits that may have been overstated are the reduction in pesticide use, the reduced use of more toxic pesticides, higher yields and farmer income. The safety of GM crops is presumed when there is a lack of evidence of harm, as if this were equivalent to evidence of lack of harm, when it clearly is not. Hence many of the safety conclusions … are assumption-based, rather than evidence-based, reasoning.\" The study does not dismiss GM crops but says they have limited value as presently employed. Rather than being a widely used technolgy, GM is limited to very few countries and just 3% of the world's farmland, says the report. \"Despite more than 30 years of research and development and nearly 20 years of commercialisation of GM crops, surprisingly only two traits have been significant in the marketplace - herbicide tolerance and insecticide production. And they are grown at scale only in a small number of countries. Industry-derived figures report a large number of global hectares under GM cultivation, but when examined … indicate an uneven global commitment to GM crops.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/11/fukushima-50-kamikaze-pilots-sacrifice","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-11T13:11:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima 50: 'We felt like kamikaze pilots ready to sacrifice everything'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/11/fukushima-50-kamikaze-pilots-sacrifice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/11/fukushima-50-kamikaze-pilots-sacrifice","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima 50: 'We felt like kamikaze pilots ready to sacrifice everything'","bodyText":"Dressed in a dark-blue work jacket with his company motif stamped on his breast pocket, Atsufumi Yoshizawa does not look like a man who spent the best part of a year in the thick of battle. Yet that is how he describes his time among the group of engineers, technicians, soldiers and firefighters who risked their lives to remain at the heart of Japan's worst nuclear crisis. The international media named them the Fukushima 50, although the actual number of workers who stayed to handle the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant ran into the hundreds. They became the heroes of the disaster. The world feted their bravery and selfless dedication, an antidote to the opprobrium being poured on Japan's hapless nuclear safety officials and politicians. But at home, almost all of the Fukushima 50 have remained anonymous. Some shun the spotlight, but many others fear reprisals as the public continues to grapple with the environmental and political fallout from the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. In a rare interview, Yoshizawa describes how the crisis unfolded, and why he does not consider himself a hero. When Japan's north-east coast was shaken by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, Yoshizawa was certain of two things: he would not flee, and he would not die. The 54-year-old nuclear engineer was about to end his shift at Fukushima Daiichi when the first powerful jolt arrived. Violent swaying ensued, causing panels to crash from the ceiling. Yoshizawa, who was in a corridor outside the plant's main control room, was forced to crouch on the floor before talking shelter beneath a desk. \"I managed to look out of a window and saw parked cars bouncing up and down from the sheer force of the earthquake. I had never experienced anything like it,\" he said in a recent interview at the headquarters of the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). Yoshizawa, who joined the company straight from university 30 years ago, was one of 6,000 workers on site that afternoon, a third of them in the restricted area near the plant's six reactors. His immediate thoughts were not with his wife and two daughters, who he assumed were safe at home in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, but with his colleagues, most of whom had families living near the plant. Tsunami Once the shaking had subsided, Yoshizawa, a slight, bespectacled man who has swapped his anti-radiation suit for a shirt and tie since his transfer last year to the Tepco headquarters, where he is general manager of the nuclear fuel cycle department, headed to an earthquake-proof room where senior staff had gathered to discuss their response. It was there, less than an hour after the quake, that news began to circulate that the plant had been struck by a tsunami much bigger than the 3-metre wave predicted in news bulletins – and far higher than the facility's protective seawall had been built to withstand. The evacuation building had no windows, so none of the men inside could see the tsunami as it ripped into the front of the reactor buildings, uprooting everything its path and sweeping them away on a tide of filthy seawater. \"The next I heard was that there was a problem with the electricity supply, and there were reports of debris floating in the sea,\" Yoshizawa says. But the reality was even more menacing. The tsunami had crippled the plant's backup power supply, plunging it into darkness. Worse still, it had deprived four of the six reactors of the power required to cool the nuclear fuel rods inside. If Yoshizawa could consider himself fortunate in those circumstances, it was that the two reactors under his control – units five and six – were already in cold shutdown for planned maintenance checks. But for as long as the power stayed off, nuclear fuel rods in the remaining four reactors would melt, causing a potentially catastrophic release of radioactive material that would reach far beyond Fukushima. Withdrawal The prime minister at the time, Naoto Kan, has since claimed Tepco was poised to pull out all of its employees, believing the situation had become irrevocable. Kan, who has converted to the anti-nuclear cause since leaving office in autumn 2011, told staff a withdrawal would spell the end of Tepco. In his darkest moments, he would later admit, he was making mental preparations for a possible evacuation of greater Tokyo, an area of 35 million people. Disagreements over a possible withdrawal rumoured to have taken place in the capital never filtered through to the men on the frontline, according to Yoshizawa. Some among the vast network of Tepco contractors and subcontractors ordered their employees to leave the plant. They were joined by other workers who lived in the communities in the path of the tsunami or which were imperilled by the reactor meltdowns. None of the workers had been able to communicate with their families; some would return to find their homes had been swept away. But at no point was anyone forced to stay, Yoshizawa said. \"I never thought of leaving. I had to stay and get a grip on the situation. I wasn't thinking about my family, only about the other workers and how worried they must have been about their own families. \"We knew that we would not be replaced. No one was forced to stay, but those of us who remained knew that we would be there until the end. We knew that we were the only people capable of saving the plant. Our determination surpassed all other considerations.\" Yoshizawa says the hardest part of his job was sending junior colleagues into dangerous situations. The plant was frequently rocked by strong aftershocks, and the proximity of so much water to electrical equipment was an ever-present danger, as was the risk of acute radiation sickness. The day after the tsunami, the plant was rocked again when a hydrogen explosion ripped though the building housing reactor No 2. Within days, two more units would suffer similar explosions. \"Several workers were injured during the hydrogen explosions, and telling people to go back into dangerous areas was tough. But [Masao] Yoshida [the then plant manager] never asked anyone to do the impossible; he knew that would only put lives at risk. By taking that approach, he united us all behind our mission.\" Explosions Momentary relief came when Yoshizawa was moved to a disaster-response headquarters 5km from the plant. While he was there, the Fukushima crisis entered an even more dangerous phase, as two explosions in reactor buildings hampered efforts to direct a constant stream of coolant water at overheating fuel rods. After three days off-site, Yoshizawa and several Tepco colleagues decided they had no choice but to return to Fukushima Daiichi. As they left the crisis headquarters, firefighters, police officers, soldiers and nuclear officials lined up to salute them. \"We felt like members of the Tokkotai [the kamikaze pilots of the second world war] in that we were prepared to sacrifice everything,\" he says. \"The people lined up outside never said as much, but I could tell by their expressions that they didn't think we would return.\" By the time Yoshizawa arrived back at the plant, the international media were referring to him and his colleagues as the Fukushima 50, though the actual number of workers probably ran into the hundreds, with each team working shifts shortened by their exposure to constantly spiking atmospheric radiation. \"I had heard the term Fukushima 50, but in fact there were many more people at the site, many more than I had imagined. And no one was panicking.\" Over the weeks that followed, the Fukushima 50 resigned themselves to a daily routine of long shifts, wrapped head to toe in protective clothing, and uncomfortable nights sleeping on the floor of a radiation-proof building. The scale of the disaster left the plant workers short of vital equipment. At one point there were not enough protective suits to go round, and stocks of personal radiation monitors had been damaged in the tsunami. \"In normal circumstances you order what you need from outside, but we were in the middle of a nuclear evacuation, Japan was the scene of a major disaster, so no one could come near the plant,\" Yoshizawa says. \"The few supplies we did have, we got ourselves.\" Initially, the men survived on a diet of biscuits and other dried food. Deliveries of emergency supplies were out of the question while soldiers were still pulling bodies from the tsunami debris and getting aid to hundreds of thousands of survivors. The water shortage meant the Fukushima 50 were denied even bowls of warming instant noodles. Deprivation For the first fortnight of the crisis, each worker was given just one 500-millilitre PET bottle of water that had to last two days. \"It was two weeks before I had my first cup of coffee,\" Yoshizawa says. \"It tasted fantastic.\" The long working hours, combined with a poor diet and sleep deprivation, took their toll on his health. He lost a lot of weight and his blood pressure soared. It wasn't until December 2011, when the government declared the damaged reactors had reached a stable state known as cold shutdown that he and his colleagues could return to anything resembling regular working conditions. Almost two years after the tsunami, the men who stayed behind at Fukushima Daiichi and spared Japan from an even worse fate occupy an uncomfortable place in the country's post-disaster psyche. While the Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped deep underground in 2010 were feted as national heroes, most of the Fukushima workers continue to live unseen in the shadow of the disaster. Tepco turns down most interview requests, and all but two of the handful of workers who have commented publicly did so on condition of anonymity. Most have chosen to remain silent, fearing they would be ostracised in the communities they tried, but failed, to prevent from turning into post-nuclear wastelands for years, perhaps decades. Yoshizawa understands their anger. \"Generally speaking, people in Japan believe we were the cause of the accident, and it's important to bear that in mind. As Tepco employees we have to take responsibility for the accident, and ensure that it never happens again. It's a matter of regaining people's trust, but it will take time. \"Looking back, maybe there were things we could have done better to prepare, but at the time we did everything possible to respond to the accident.\" The perception that the workers perpetrated the accident and then botched their response appeared to permeate every level of Japanese society. The Fukushima 50 waited 18 months before the then prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, publicly thanked them for \"saving Japan\", a gesture repeated this month by his successor, Shinzo Abe. Gratitude If official expressions of gratitude were a long time coming, the men were buoyed from messages of support from all over the world, some of which decorate a huge Japanese flag that hangs in the Fukushima Daiichi central control room. Yoshizawa said Noda's visit to the plant last October was an honour, but added: \"I don't consider myself a hero, but when I hear people thanking us for what we did, I'm grateful.\" His account of a temporary return to \"civilian\" life one month after the disaster is perhaps the most telling commentary on the Fukushima 50's unheralded heroism. As Yoshizawa left the plant, along with several other workers, to spend a few days with his family, he stripped to his underpants, completed a compulsory radiation check and changed into a tracksuit that was at least a size too big. He had grown an impressive beard, and his hair had become greasy and matted after four weeks without a bath or shower. A few hours later, their bus arrived at Tokyo Station, where they were left to catch trains to their respective homes. \"We must have looked strange, stepping off that bus in ill-fitting tracksuits, with long beards and dishevelled hair, and each carrying a plastic bag containing a few possessions,\" he says. \"But as we walked into the station no one gave us a second glance. Life in Tokyo appeared to be carrying on as normal, as if the Fukushima disaster had never happened. I sat down on the train and immediately noticed that people were avoiding sitting next to me.\" Choice Yoshizawa declined to divulge his internal radiation levels. They are abnormal, he admits, but not so high that he can never work at a nuclear power plant again. \"I am not worried about my health.\" He has, by choice, had just one counselling session since he left Fukushima Daiichi. \"Others have done it more regularly, it's important to have someone to talk to freely. But I don't kid myself that life will ever be the same. As a Tepco employee, returning to a normal life is impossible.\" While they slowly withdraw from Japan's public consciousness, the ranks of the Fukushima 50 say they will never forget their time at the centre of a nuclear disaster that, without them, could have been far worse. \"There is a special bond between us,\" Yoshizawa says. \"I can't put it into words – it's just a feeling we have towards one another. I guess it's the same as the camaraderie soldiers experience in wartime. In our case, the enemy was a nuclear power plant. And we fought it together.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-deal-q-and-a","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-08T20:11:14Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal: Q&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-deal-q-and-a","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-deal-q-and-a","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal: Q&A","bodyText":"What is likely to be in the agreement that is being negotiated? This is a deal intended to defuse tensions and buy time for diplomacy. It would slow down the development of the Iranian nuclear programme on one hand and ease the build-up of sanctions on the other. It could release billions of dollars in Iranian frozen assets in Europe as a sweetener to help the new Iranian government sell the deal to the clerical and military leadership in Tehran. An interim deal would have to address Iran's stock of medium-enriched uranium, the most immediate proliferation worry. One way of doing this would be to turn it into reactor fuel, which is harder to enrich further to weapons grade, so less threatening. Some limits are also likely to set on Iran's production of low enriched uranium and the number of centrifuges it has spinning so that the west could be assured that Iran was not amassing production capacity that it could \"break out\" – and dash to the production of a weapon too rapidly. Will the agreement stick, even if it is agreed in Geneva? The Obama administration would be able to arrange for the unfreezing of Iranian assets without having to go to Congress, but it would still have to convince the Senate not to pass the further raft of sanctions that are currently being prepared. If those were passed, it could derail the deal. In Iran, President Rouhani will come under fire from conservative critics for giving way for too little, but as long as he has the backing of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, he should be able to ride out the storm. Binyamin Netanyahu's furious denunciation of the deal might actually help sell it to hardliners. What is left to be agreed? A long-term settlement over the status of Iran's nuclear programme. Currently, Iran's uranium enrichment has been outlawed by successive UN security council resolutions. A comprehensive deal would accept Iran's right to enrich but place safeguards on it, while lifting sanctions generally. Most probably a cap will be agreed, so that Iran is not allowed to produce any uranium more than 5% enriched, pure enough for nuclear power stations but not nearly enough for weapons. There would also be limits on the stockpile of low enriched uranium Iran could hold without turning it into reactor fuel, and/or limits on the number and types of centrifuges it can have spinning in its enrichment plant. Some agreement would have to be reached on how many enrichment plants Iran could run (Iran has suggested it could live with two) and whether one of those can be the underground plant at Fordow. A comprehensive solution would also have to address the heavy water plant at Arak, which is nearing completion and which would produce plutonium when commissioned, another serious proliferation risk. If a deal is signed, does that mean sanctions work? That is certainly the view in western capitals. It comes in the wake of steadily intensifying punitive measures, but cause and effect may not be so clear-cut. Iranians say that the breakthrough is a more direct result of the Iranian people electing Hassan Rouhani, and that was for a whole raft of reasons, only some of which had to do with foreign affairs, and only a few of those had to do with sanctions. It was a general rejection of hardline politics, in which sanctions could have played a role. It seems clear however that adding more sanctions now would backfire, undermining Rouhani and strengthening the hand of hardliners in Tehran who are arguing that the west cannot be trusted and that Iran's only reliable strategy is defiance. Analysts also argue that the west could have clinched today's deal several years ago, but had used sanctions in an abortive attempt to get Iran to stop enrichment altogether. That bid has clearly failed, as acceptance of Iranian enrichment at some level will have to be a part of any workable long-term agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/01/scottish-government-nuclear-power-snp","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-01T10:54:10Z","webTitle":"Scottish government signals end to nuclear power opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/01/scottish-government-nuclear-power-snp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/01/scottish-government-nuclear-power-snp","fields":{"headline":"Scottish government signals end to nuclear power opposition","bodyText":"The Scottish government has shifted away from its hardline opposition to nuclear power after the energy minister said there was a \"rational case\" for extending the life of Scotland's two nuclear plants. Fergus Ewing, the energy minister, told MSPs on Thursday that the Scottish National party (SNP) government was \"perfectly open\" to the continued use of Hunterston and Torness power stations, to ensure there was security of supply. The Conservative opposition and environmental campaigners said this was a marked change in the government's stance, as the SNP has been opposed to the entire principle of nuclear power, a policy long regarded as a strict article of faith for its activists and many backbenchers. Environment campaigners were stunned by Ewing's statement, claiming it undermined his statements last month that nuclear energy had no future after the Fukushima disaster and after Germany's announcement it was to phase out nuclear power. They added that Alex Salmond had led the SNP to a landslide victory in the Scottish elections in May partly on a promise that 100% of Scotland's domestic electricity needs would be met by renewable energy by 2020. Stan Blackley, chief executive of Friends of the Earth (FoE) Scotland, said the minister's statement was \"deeply disturbing and utterly disappointing.\" He added: \"Fergus Ewing's statement to the Scottish parliament that the SNP is now 'perfectly open' to extending the life of Scotland's nuclear power stations can only be interpreted as a significant policy shift. The SNP has always been viewed as anti-nuclear and I'm sure many SNP voters will feel quite misled when they learn that this is not the case anymore.\" In a joint letter they only recently sent to Ewing, FoE Scotland, WWF Scotland and Nuclear Free Local Authorities Scotland urged the minister to oppose plans to extend the life of two reactors at Hunterston B until 2021 or 2026 which are now being drawn up by its operator EDF. They said that Hunterston B, on the coast of Ayrshire, will be 40 years old when its current licence runs out in 2016. It was already the focus of safety concerns, and the campaigners urged Ewing to commission an independent review of the risks of continuing to operate its reactors. Scotland's newest nuclear power station at Torness near Edinburgh, which had to be shut down this week because of sudden influx of jellyfish around its water intake pipe, is due to operate until 2023. Ewing's statement implied the SNP would also accept extending Torness's life further until the late 2020s or beyond, making the SNP's opposition to new nuclear power stations largely meaningless. Jackson Carlaw, the Conservative climate change spokesman, said: \"This is an unexpected yet welcome U-turn from the SNP government. Coming after years of uncompromising anti-nuclear rhetoric, I suspect it is one they will not wish to be reminded of too often. \"For so long the SNP has repeatedly set its face against any on-going role for nuclear to secure both a low carbon solution and a continuity of energy supply throughout this decade, voting against a Scottish Conservative amendment to achieve just that only a few weeks ago.\" Ewing, speaking in a Holyrood debate on his government's new \"route map\" for achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2020, said his government was still opposed to building any new power stations. The minister, appointed to the energy post after Salmond's landslide victory in the May Scottish elections, said: \"Turning to the question about the extension of the life of nuclear power stations, that is something which we accept should be considered rationally. \"We are perfectly open to an extension of the life of the existing nuclear power stations provided that case is justified on economic and environmental grounds and therefore we recognise that that case exists and it exists because of the need to secure security of supply. \"That is something that we have always recognised whilst we are opposed clearly to building new nuclear power stations.\" A Scottish government spokesman denied there had been any change in policy. He said the SNP government had always accepted that the life of Hunterston and Torness could be extended, and had said so when the plans for Hunterston were outlined in 2007. He added that the devolved parliament at Holyrood had no power to prevent the licence of an existing nuclear station from being extended, as that authority rested with the UK government. It could only block new nuclear plants through the planning process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/22/centrica-typifies-ills-british-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-22T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Centrica typifies the ills of the British energy industry | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/22/centrica-typifies-ills-british-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/22/centrica-typifies-ills-british-energy-industry","fields":{"headline":"Centrica typifies the ills of the British energy industry","bodyText":"Nobody foresaw the perfect storm now hitting the world's energy markets. There is the fracking revolution in the US, so that it is awash with oil and gas, and its displaced coal producers are flooding world markets with cheap coal. There is Germany's decision to stop all nuclear energy production by 2022, while Japan's nuclear production has been mothballed. And all round the world there is more and more wind and renewable power coming on stream. All the calculations and assumptions about what energy plant makes what profits are being thrown out the window. In Britain, our privatised electricity and gas industry is especially vulnerable. Chasing high financial returns, it thought it smart in the 1990s and early 00s to invest in producing energy from burning cheap gas. But it is now renewables, nuclear and cheap American coal that are low cost and profitable. Margins on burning gas have collapsed; indeed, for the last two years, gas-fired power generation has lost money. As a result, our power companies are mothballing or closing them down. Coal-fired power stations are next in line for early redundancy because they have burned through their EU allotted allocation of dirty, carbon-emitting power capacity even sooner than was predicted, largely because coal has been cheap. Consequently, in 18 months' time, the margin of surplus energy capacity over our demand will have shrunk to the most dangerously narrow levels since electricity became universally available in the 1930s. So the new chair of Centrica, Richard Haythornthwaite, warning in lurid terms last week that after the next election \"the possibility of the lights going out in Britain will be looming much larger\", is not to be dismissed. He is right. He is also not wrong to plead for a constructive dialogue around the key issues of prices, profits, vital new investment and the long-term structure of the industry, including whether his own firm could and should be broken up. But sadly, he suggested that much of the blame for the emerging risk of the lights going out was because of Ed Miliband's proposed 20-month energy price freeze. He must know it is a cheap shot: Centrica can hedge against adverse wholesale price movements that will guarantee no losses. The structural problems of energy provision and, indeed, the pressures on his own company, go very much deeper than that. In the first place, in the spirit of a constructive dialogue, it would be helpful if he could acknowledge the perfect storm that has hit the UK energy market and its role in accelerating the rate at which plants are being closed. The Labour party had nothing to do with it. He must also know that in an industry where the paybacks from investment can take as long as 35 or 40 years, and whose output – energy – is indispensable to the life of the nation, there is an inevitable interdependence between government and the energy sector. To plead, as his chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, does, that politics does not make the industry an attractive place to work (and for which he should be compensated with a £5m pay package) is to bay at the moon. Politics is intrinsic to energy because without government price guarantees, subsidies and grants, there will simply be inadequate investment. Or there could be huge concentrations in capacity that could suddenly be unprofitable. The borders between a public-private partnership to deliver a continuous, secure flow of reasonably priced energy from a diversity of low-carbon sources and inadequately regulated companies are extremely hard to define and patrol. The task is made harder still because of the intense pressures from Centrica's shareholders to deliver extraordinarily high financial rates of return, made worse because the directors' team, rewarded in bonuses and options related to share-price performance, are strongly incentivised to focus only on the share price. Leading City economist Andrew Smithers, in his important book, The Road to Recovery, argues that the collapse in business investment, weak economic recovery and persistently high government deficit are because UK executives across the board concentrate far too much on short-term share price performance. Investment and research and development, unless underwritten by the state, are far too hazardous. Companies would rather buy back their shares and pay high dividends. Professor Richard Jones, in a paper for the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute, showed that one of the consequences of privatisation was a collapse in R&amp;D. By 2005, British utilities were spending a mere £15m in total, a fraction of what they did when in public ownership and not enough to buy a decent town house in Notting Hill. Only the establishment of the Energy Technologies Institute, comprising a consortium of companies (but not Centrica), together with the government, has partially turned the crisis around. But the UK is hardly leading energy R&amp;D. Centrica could and should be at the heart of a UK energy investment and innovation revolution as we try to create some stability. Instead, it buys its shares back rather than invests, pulls out of the consortium with EDF to build nuclear power stations despite guaranteed returns of 10% for 35 years and, with around 40% of all gas customers in the UK, enjoys margins several times higher than in electricity provision. Its preoccupation with financial returns is proof positive of Andrew Smithers's case, even down to Sam Laidlaw's pay package. Why does any executive need to earn roughly 190 times the average wage? He says it is because he is doing a job of national importance, which he is, but so does cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, on £190,000. Could it be that Mr Laidlaw and his team are paid too much, actively hurting Centrica? Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of John Lewis, receives a salary 60 times larger than the company's average member of staff. Is Mr Laidlaw a three times better leader with three times the challenges? Mr Miliband has the temerity to raise all these points and to argue for a better, more transparent and competitive structure for the energy industry. In fairness, so does the energy secretary, Ed Davey. British business darkly mutters that both are anti-business and some in the Labour party think it is time for Miliband to hug if not a banker, certainly a businessman. Centrica has all the potential to be one of the companies that could turn the UK around, but it won't as it is currently owned, managed and incentivised within an industry that is so little trusted. Rick Haythornthwaite would have a much more constructive dialogue if he acknowledged as much. He might even get a hug."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jun/23/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-23T16:27:00Z","webTitle":"Citizens across world oppose nuclear power, poll finds | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jun/23/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jun/23/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"Citizens across world oppose nuclear power, poll finds","bodyText":"I've been able to express my thoughts on nuclear power on this blog, but what do the citizens of the world think? A new opinion poll from Ipsos MORI tells us: 62% of citizens in 24 countries across the world oppose the use of nuclear energy, with a quarter of those having change their minds after the Fukushima disaster. Before looking in more detail at the poll, let me make very clear that I think the debate over nuclear power is a fiendishly complex one. It encompasses the risks of rising carbon dioxide, the strength of political will behind renewables like wind and solar, whether the true cost of nuclear can be calculated and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I don't think there's an easy formula that combines all these factors and into which you can feed data and get the \"right\" answer. You have to make your own judgements about some things, as I've written before, and one of those things is public opinion. This is a proper poll, across a wide range of countries and details of the poll methodology is at the end of this post. I am also promised a link to the full data, which I have only as a file. I'll add that when it arrives. So what stands out? The most anti-nuclear nations in the poll, at about 80% against, were Italy, Germany and Mexico. Only three of the 24 countries had majorities that favoured nuclear power: India (61%), Poland (57%) and the US (52%). The UK and Sweden were split 50-50 within the uncertainty cited. In France, where most of the electricity is produced by nuclear, 67% opposed it, the same percentage as in coal-rich Australia. Perhaps surprisingly, 42% of people in Japan, still recovering from the huge tremor that wrecked the Fukushima nuclear plant, remain supportive of nuclear power. The pollsters also asked whether people opposed other ways of generating electricity. With 62% against, nuclear was the least popular, followed by coal (52% against), gas (20%), hydroelectricity (9%), wind power (7%) and solar power (3%). Polls can't tell us why people hold the opinions they do. But its blindingly clear that renewables have global support. It is possible to keep the lights on without nuclear, if renewables get the huge support needed from governments. My question is whether governments are listening to what people want? Methodology: The survey was conducted in 24 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States of America. An international sample of 18,787 adults aged 18-64 were interviewed between May 6 and May 21, 2011 via the Ipsos Online Panel system. Approximately 1000+ individuals participated in each country with the exception of Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Russia and Turkey, where each have a sample 500+. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflected that of the adult population according to the most recent country Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. A survey with an unweighted probability sample of this size and a 100% response rate would have an estimated margin of error of +/-3.1 percentage points for a sample of 1,000 and an estimated margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points for a sample of 500."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/15/london-china-investment-rules-yuan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-15T12:54:34Z","webTitle":"Boost for London as China agrees to loosen yuan investment rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/15/london-china-investment-rules-yuan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/15/london-china-investment-rules-yuan","fields":{"headline":"Boost for London as China agrees to loosen yuan investment rules","bodyText":"Beijing will give London-based institutions the right to invest directly into China using the yuan, George Osborne has announced, giving the City an edge over other financial centres fighting for business. Investors will be able to apply for licences to buy Chinese stocks and bonds – rather than having to go via Hong Kong – with an initial quota of 80bn yuan (£8.2bn), under the extension of the Renminbi Qualified Financial Institutional Investor scheme. Chinese banks will also be able to apply to open wholesale branches in Britain, rather than using tightly regulated subsidiaries – encouraging them to expand their activity in the UK. \"Today we agreed the next big step in making London – already the global centre for finance – a major global centre for trading and investing the Chinese currency too,\" the chancellor told reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday after talks with the Chinese vice-premier Ma Kai. \"More trade and more investment means more business and more jobs for Britain.\" Osborne's five-day trade mission marks a thaw in bilateral relations after China called off high-level visits over David Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama last year. The UK and China have also agreed to allow direct trading between sterling and the yuan, rather than via the dollar. The pound will become the fourth currency to trade directly with the yuan, following the US and Australian dollars and the yen, though it is unclear when trading will begin. China is seeking to internationalise its currency, but is treading cautiously due to fears over volatility. The UK is already a global hub for trading other currencies. Britain accounts for 62% of yuan trading outside China and Hong Kong. Daily trade in London has risen to around $5bn (£3.1bn) since it began last year. Osborne later announced on Twitter that the ICBC bank would issue a yuan bond in London next month. Chinese banks have been pushing hard for the right to open branches and several warned the Treasury last year that they were moving much of their business to Luxembourg because of the restrictions imposed by their subsidiary status. The new arrangements will allow them to deal with companies and financial institutions, but not individual customers. Branch status allows them to draw on the capital of their main operations; the hope is that they will be able to invest more in the UK. Creating new branches is cheaper and more efficient for the banks. Regulators are concerned that branches face looser controls; but should they need rescuing, their home governments must take responsibility, while Britain covers subsidiaries. Banks from the US and several European countries have branches in the UK. The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on civil nuclear co-operation, paving the way for a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company to join EDF Energy in building a new plant at Hinkley Point. \"Chinese investment in our infrastructure is welcome,\" said Osborne. \"Like all investments they have to be done in an open and transparent way, but we have seen investment already in London's water supply and Heathrow airport and we have found China to be very straightforward partners in investment. Equally, there is a huge amount of British investment in China.\" Other announcements by the chancellor include Chinese investment in Manchester's Airport City development and visa changes to encourage wealthy Chinese people to visit the UK. Mark Henderson, chairman of the London Luxury Quarter, said the new procedures could give an enormous boost to the fortunes of British retailers. Chinese tourists spent £262m across Mayfair, Piccadilly and St James's in 2012, a 32% increase year-on-year. But at present Britain gets only 200,000 of the two million Chinese who visit Europe annually."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/nov/27/iran-nuclear-deal-world-safer-place-hans-blix-obama-kerry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-27T16:54:04Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal will make the world a safer place | Hans Blix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/iran-nuclear-deal-world-safer-place-hans-blix-obama-kerry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/iran-nuclear-deal-world-safer-place-hans-blix-obama-kerry","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal will make the world a safer place","bodyText":"The interim agreement just reached in Geneva committing Iran to a number of restraints in its nuclear programme and providing some relief in the pressures against Iran should be welcomed by all. Above all, it should remove – at any rate, for six months – the threat of unilateral military action and the potentially grave consequences such action would have for the world and the authority of the UN. The interim agreement now gives the negotiating states six months working space – renewable – to achieve a comprehensive peaceful settlement. The US is now enabled, as it was in the case of Syria, to move away from the role of self-appointed global policeman that neither President Obama, the US public nor the world is comfortable with. Instead, responsibility is shared with all other permanent members of the UN security council, Germany and the EU, thus facilitating action that will need to be taken within the council and the UN system. Barack Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, deserve credit for seizing the opportunity for agreement that the new Iranian government offered through the conciliatory attitude it has shown in both matters of substance and tone. The former deserve credit all the more, as their policy means going against the demands of the Israeli government and its many supporters in Congress. For Iran, the commitments made – for six months – constitute substantial bars to any bombmaking. However, refraining from enriching uranium above 5% and from advancing activities at enrichment plants or at the Arak reactor; reducing the stock of 20% enriched uranium; and accepting enhanced monitoring by no means curtail the development of the peaceful nuclear power program. In return, Iran obtains compensation through the easing of various restrictions, the unfreezing of some funds, and a promise of no additional sanctions. Perhaps even more importantly, an expectation arises of more normal economic and other relations with the world. Some critics have characterised the agreement as a \"Munich\". For whom? One may understand the anger that some states in the Middle East, including Israel, have felt about various Iranian activities and rhetoric in the past. However, conduct that seems menacing comes in many shapes and from many quarters in the Middle East: Iran has been the subject of advanced cyber warfare, seen the assassination of nuclear scientists and watched demonstrations of long-distance military air operations. The relief now offered Iran comes from states that have had naval units in the Gulf pointing their guns at the country, and that have imposed choking economic actions against it outside of any UN authorisations. Is it seriously suggested that the foreign ministers of these states are now returning from a Munich? The interim agreement avoids tackling the controversial issue of \"the right to enrich\". Some have argued that the article in the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) which declares that nothing in the agreement affects the \"inalienable right\" to \"develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\" should be seen as qualifying the right of enrichment. Others hold – more persuasively, I think – that the article merely underlines that, beyond the obligation not to \"manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons\", the NPT parties have not undertaken any restriction in their freedom of using nuclear energy. When the new Geneva agreement records the Iranian announcement that it will not – for six months – enrich uranium over 5%, Iran may reasonably claim that – despite the security council's demanding a suspension of enrichment – the agreement must be seen as at least acquiescing in Iran's future enrichment up to 5%. Even more interesting is the aim, somewhat cryptically declared, of a comprehensive solution to \"involve a mutually defined enrichment programme\" with \"mutually agreed parameters consistent with practical needs\" and, at the end of the road, to provide for Iran being treated \"in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state\". We get the impression that the five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany and the EU have come to some joint policy lines to meet the risk of nuclear proliferation. These allow the use of economic pressures but do not comprise the threat or use of armed force. Parties to the NPT should themselves determine what nuclear programmes they wish to pursue, but these should be consistent with agreed practical needs. Iran should be able to live with that. One would now wish that the nuclear weapon states proceed to apply this new-found collective wisdom to reduce their own excessive armaments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-victory-diplomacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-24T19:45:00Z","webTitle":"The nuclear deal with Iran is a historic victory for diplomacy| Michael Axworthy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-victory-diplomacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/24/iran-nuclear-deal-victory-diplomacy","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear deal with Iran is a historic victory for diplomacy","bodyText":"Despite a thin, lingering cloud of buts and maybes, the deal concluded between Iran and six leading countries over Tehran's nuclear programme in the small hours of Sunday morning was historic – the kind of diplomatic agreement that alters the political landscape, forces at least some of the intransigent to change their positions, and opens up new opportunities that previously seemed hopelessly far-fetched. The core of the interim deal is that Iran has agreed to suspend uranium enrichment above the 5% level (pending a final settlement to be negotiated within the next six months) in exchange for relaxation of some sanctions – a relaxation estimated to be worth $7bn to Iran (\"modest\", according to the US). In addition, the Iranians have agreed to begin converting uranium enriched to a higher level to put it beyond weapon use, to increase the frequency and intrusiveness of inspections, to suspend work on the Arak plutonium plant, and to halt development of improved centrifuges that would greatly increase the speed and efficiency of enrichment. Initially, some reports noted an apparent difference of view post-deal – the Iranians were claiming it recognised Tehran's right to enrich uranium, while the US and others were saying that it had done no such thing. As with many diplomatic ambiguities, both are right, and both wrong. No such statement appears in the deal in those terms, but it does provide for Iran to continue enrichment below the 5% level (consistent with \"peaceful purposes\"), subject to conditions and the still-to-be-negotiated final settlement. It soon emerged that the Iranian negotiators had full backing for the terms they had agreed – President Hassan Rouhani and, more important, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, quickly issued statements welcoming it. Khamenei said: \"God's grace and the support of the Iranian nation were the reasons behind this success.\" Khamenei's acclaim should ensure that the voices of dissenting hardliners in Iran will be muted. The blast of disapproval for the deal from the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will also help quieten dissent within Iran. President Obama has already decided he can face down both Israeli and Saudi opposition. But he does have to persuade Congress and others to give this process a chance, and not impose new sanctions. To this end Obama and his colleagues are presenting the deal as a \"first step\" that halts or reverses Iran's nuclear programme. The US would be wise to avoid any tendency towards triumphalism, but the deal does represent real progress towards making safe the Iranian nuclear enterprise. Signed off by seven of the world's most important foreign ministers, it nonetheless also signifies international recognition of Iran as a major nuclear power. Part of the significance of the deal is that both the US and Iran have pulled back from positions of intransigence, confrontation and escalation. The Iranians could have remained obdurate against any kind of concessions or limits on their nuclear programme, accepting the price of isolation and the massive economic damage from sanctions, and making life miserable for their people. The US could have continued with the \"no enrichment, can't trust Iran\" line, steadily increasing the sanctions' pressure until the only sanctions left to apply were military ones. It is a mistake for Netanyahu, the Saudis or anyone else to suggest that would have been the right course. Things may yet go wrong, but it must be right to give the delicate seedlings of trust and diplomacy a chance. It involves risk, and courage, but it is the kind of risk that, ultimately, politicians are paid to take. After a decade and a half of interventionist wars, American, British and other servicemen and their families have a right to demand that diplomats and politicians exhaust all avenues of negotiation before we resort to military options. In the continuing talks, the Iranians will look for an explicit statement of their right to enrich uranium, and the six will look for tight safeguards to prevent the Iranians engaging in weapons-related development. The US will also, doubtless, look for new commitments from the Iranians to soften their stance on Israel. Meanwhile, we should not overlook the internal political situation in Iran. Ultimately, improvements in the political and human rights fields are up to the Iranians. But an Iran that is engaged with the outside world is more amenable to influence in the right direction than one that is isolated and shouting at the rest of the world through a megaphone, à la Mahmoud Ahmadinejad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/dec/11/us-china-leadership-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-11T16:54:38Z","webTitle":"The US and China must show leadership on climate change | Nicholas Stern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/dec/11/us-china-leadership-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/dec/11/us-china-leadership-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The US and China must show leadership on climate change","bodyText":"The world is approaching a watershed moment in its battle to limit the risks posed by global climate change, and international leadership from the United States is needed now more than ever before. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in September warned that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are already raising temperatures, melting glaciers and the polar ice caps, elevating sea levels and changing the strength and frequency of many extreme weather events. Without sharp reductions in emissions, global average temperature could be much more than 2C degrees above its pre-industrial level by the end of the century, beyond anything the Earth has seen for millions of years, and way outside the experience of modern Homo sapiens. The United States National Climate Assessment, published in draft form earlier this year, warned that the American people are already experiencing the consequences of global warming, and that their health and livelihoods will be even more at risk as temperatures rise further. Rich countries, such as the United States, will not be able to simply adapt to the direct impacts. The Assessment points out, for instance, that sea level could rise by as much as four feet by the end of the century, potentially threatening nearly five million Americans who live within four feet of the local high-tide mark. And the impacts of climate change on other parts of the world could also have severe consequences for the United States. We have seen the disruption that was caused to global food supplies, for instance, by severe droughts which wipe out yields of important crops. Not only do such extreme events cause hardship and suffering, but they also create the conditions for political instability. Hundreds of millions of people could begin to migrate away from the worst affected areas, with the potential for severe and extended conflict around the world. Hence, even if Americans were concerned only about themselves, there are compelling reasons for the United States to promote an acceleration of international efforts to limit the risks of future climate change. However, a recent analysis by the United Nations Environment Programme showed that the cuts in emissions that are currently planned by individual countries are collectively inconsistent with avoiding global warming of more than 2C degrees. Countries are now seeking a new international agreement in Paris in 2015 to secure the greater action required to stay below the threshold for dangerous climate change, but little progress was made during the latest round of United Nations negotiations last month in Warsaw. With the European Union currently dithering and unable to provide the leadership that it has previously shown on climate change, the stage has been set for the world’s two largest emitters, China and the United States, to set an example. Despite the unwillingness of many in Congress to face up to climate change, the United States managed to reduce its overall greenhouse emissions by nearly 8% between 2007 and 2011, with carbon dioxide from energy use falling even further in the past two years. But China is showing the greatest ambition. As its economy continues to expand, it is attempting to make a rapid transition to cleaner and more efficient growth. China is investing very heavily in low-carbon energy, spending $10 billion on wind farms and almost $13 billion on nuclear power in 2012 alone. More than a fifth of its electricity was generated from sources other than fossil fuels last year. However, China is not only the world’s largest consumer of clean electricity. It is also the biggest manufacturer of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels. For China, the global transition to low-carbon economic growth is not primarily a burden, but rather a race to exploit the huge opportunities created by new markets at home and overseas. China’s leadership recognises that the transition to a low-carbon economy is likely to be full of innovation, discovery, investment and growth. Indeed, it will provide the growth story of the next few decades, and it will lead to a world that is cleaner, quieter, safer, and more biologically diverse, with stronger communities. Earlier this year, China and the United States forged a strategic collaboration on climate change, in recognition of the risks and opportunities that the world faces. It is through this kind of joint leadership that both countries can promote prosperity and well-being, not just for their own citizens, but for future generations across the world. • Professor Lord Nicholas Stern is chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science.

The choice of the West Burton site for a fresh wave of protest, which campaigners expect to attract numbers \"in the high hundreds\", may be controversial because it was targeted last year by 21 activists from the group No Dash for Gas. The activists managed to shut down the gas-fired power station for seven days, but were arrested and then pursued by the owner EDF Energy, which attempted to sue them for £5m in damages. The French-owned company abandoned its lawsuit in the wake of public condemnation, including a petition signed by 64,000 people and support for the activists from prominent figures including Noam Chomsky, Richard Dawkins and Naomi Klein, French-owned EDF. The activists, however, remain under legal injunctions not to return to the West Burton site. EDF is also one of the companies in talks with ministers over a controversial government programme to build a series of nuclear power stations in the UK. The planned summer demonstration at West Burton is modelled on the \"climate camp\" protests against coal-fired electrical generation that disrupted the operations of power stations at key locations including Drax and Kingsnorth for several years. But it marks the changed focus from coal – the dirtiest fossil fuel – to gas, which has received strong support from the current government. Activists from a variety of organisations are expected, including campaigners from anti-poverty and anti-cuts groups. It is not known whether any of the 21 activists under injunction will attempt to return to the site. But the organisers are confident that there will be many more members of the public taking part in the protest, expected to run from 17-20 August. Kevin Smith of No Dash for Gas said: \"Last year 21 people took direct action, but 64,000 more joined No Dash for Gas in their fight against EDF's lawsuit. We'll be calling on these people and others to return to West Burton for a bigger, broader direct action that will push for real solutions to the economic and climate crises.\" West Burton is the first of more than 20 new gas-fired power stations that are expected to be given the go-ahead by ministers. Gas has been promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, as a cleaner fuel than coal, but energy experts including the government's own statutory advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, have said that an over-reliance on gas will increase emissions and could lead to large rises in the cost of energy. As North Sea gas supplies have started to deplete, and the UK has turned from an exporter to a net importer of the fuel, volatile gas prices have led to large increases in the price of energy to households and businesses. The government has said gas will be needed to \"keep the lights on\" as many of the UK's ageing coal-fired and nuclear power stations are taken out of service in the next few years. But green campaigners say the government's support for gas is starving renewable forms of energy of investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/dec/30/energy-firm-ovo-wins-customers-disparaging-bill-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-30T15:48:09Z","webTitle":"Ovo founder emerges as a 2013 winner after tackling big six energy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/30/energy-firm-ovo-wins-customers-disparaging-bill-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/dec/30/energy-firm-ovo-wins-customers-disparaging-bill-rises","fields":{"headline":"Ovo founder emerges as a 2013 winner after tackling big six energy firms","bodyText":"The last 12 months have been terrible for energy executives, who have replaced banking bosses as public punchbags on the back of soaring fuel prices and fractured trust. But one electricity entrepreneur, Stephen Fitzpatrick, came out on top by publicly demolishing the carefully choreographed excuses for bill rises proffered by the big six power groups. Now the biggest problem for Fitzpatrick's business, Ovo Energy, is how to deal with the 20,000 new customers who have flooded in since his dramatic intervention at a parliamentary select committee meeting in October. The 36-year-old Ulsterman said: \"We had been very focused on 2013 as a year of consolidation. The worst thing that a company like ours can do is grow too quickly, which can lead to service levels dropping. To be honest we were caught by surprise. \"This is the third time I have made these kinds of remarks, but in the past no one noticed. This time brand awareness has shot up and it has translated into immediate new business.\" Ovo, however, had already planned a big push for new customers in 2014 and invested in staff and technology over the last 12 months in preparation. The company has a strategy of developing the nascent online energy supplier (named after the Latin for egg) from the current level of 150,000 customers to a total of 1 million within four years. Compared with the almost 8 million households who buy from British Gas, this is still small. So Christmas came early for Fitzpatrick, the son of a Belfast greengrocer who studied business at Edinburgh University, became a City trader and then turned IT entrepreneur. He admits he had no prior experience of the energy sector before setting up the Bristol-based business in 2009. But Ovo's turnover has risen from £80m to £210m in less than two years. And being a newcomer did not mean he was loth to speak out, as the select committee on energy and climate change found when it called him to give evidence two months ago. Most of the big six suppliers had sent less senior executives to face the MPs. The energy executives claimed at the committee to have reluctantly imposed price rises of 10% because of government imposed green taxes and other social burdens. But Fitzpatrick broke ranks by saying that the large conglomerates charged as much as they thought they could get away with, leaving their customers struggling with fuel poverty. \"I can't explain any of these price rises,\" he told the committee's MPs. \"They [the big six] load the environmental and social obligations on to those customers who are less likely to leave. A lot of energy companies are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with.\" He also ripped into the energy regulator, Ofgem, for allowing the powerful energy companies to dominate both the wholesale side and the retail side of the British energy market. Fitzpatrick went on to accuse Centrica-owned British Gas of running a dedicated win-back team whose job was to call leaving customers and offer to cut their bills. Two months on, the former trader of credit default swaps at JP Morgan may not be impressed by the state of the energy market but he has little time either for the various fixes that have been proposed by Ed Miliband. The Labour leader made energy a hot political topic by pledging to freeze prices if his party won the general election and to break up large companies such as SSE and British Gas. Fitzpatrick said: \"It is obviously good that people are now talking about the issue but the price freeze is a slogan, not a policy. We need to see a lot more detail on this energy policy and until we do so it just creates a lot of uncertainty.\" He thinks the biggest reason for the lack of power generation facilities being built is not uncertainty but the lack of cash held by the big six. He said: \"This is a capital-intensive business but if you look at most of the big six they have very stretched balance sheets. \"RWE has huge debts, Iberdrola [the multinational owner of Scottish Power] is highly leveraged and they are very challenged in their home markets [Germany and Spain].\" The French state-owned EDF is the only big six member to have experienced some success in the UK this year, tying up a 35-year subsidy package to fund the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. But Fitzpatrick describes this nuclear option as very expensive for the government and consumers. Yet the biggest problem for the big six, he maintains, is that the interests of the companies are not aligned with the interests of their customers. \"People need to be reducing their usage and demand for energy, yet the large companies make money by selling more power. If what's best for your customers is bad for your business, you are living on borrowed time. \"By contrast we want to make money by doing what is best for customers. Whether that is through providing energy efficiency schemes or smart meters, there are lots of ways to help.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-29T09:52:30Z","webTitle":"Nuclear giants RWE and E.ON drop plans to build new UK reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear giants RWE and E.ON drop plans to build new UK reactors","bodyText":"The government's nuclear energy policy is in disarray after German utilities RWE and E.ON scrapped plans to build two reactors in the UK, prompting warnings of serious knock-on effects for jobs and economic growth. Nuclear power is a cornerstone of the government's low-carbon agenda and the Horizon joint venture, co-owned by RWE and E.ON, was a key contributor due to its plans to construct new stations at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Progress on those projects was shelved on Thursday when Horizon's owners put the business on the market, citing doubts over financing the projects and costs associated with the German government's decision to abandon nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. \"A combination of these strategic factors, together with the significant ongoing costs of running the Horizon joint venture, has led to a situation where capital investment plans have been reviewed,\" the companies said in a joint statement. The government has identified nuclear power as one of three energy sources – including renewables and carbon capture storage – that will help the UK cut carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. Wylfa and Oldbury were two of the eight sites identified by the government as possible locations nuclear power stations. The decision sent shockwaves through the sector. A senior nuclear industry figure told the Guardian: \"It's a total train wreck – you can't imagine the importance of this to the economy of north Wales. This programme is bigger than the whole Olympics. The government now has to try to find another buyer.\" Horizon's owners had made the the economic benefits of their plans a key part of their pitch, pledging to invest at least £15bn in nuclear power, creating a total of 800 permanent jobs at each site and employing 10,000 people during construction of Wylfa and Oldbury with construction due to begin on the first site in 2015. Horizon had planned up to 6GW of new nuclear plants in Britain by 2025, encouraged by a government that has been more pro-nuclear than other countries with eight sites earmarked for development. The three companies planning new nuclear power plants in the UK – EDF, Horizon and NuGen – were preparing to generate 16GW of electricity capacity from their new sites, enough to replace Britain's current nuclear output. Without new sites there will be only one operational nuclear plant left in the UK by 2023: Sizewell B in Suffolk. France's EDF, the biggest player in nuclear power in the UK with four reactors under development and eight in operation, has been mooted as a potential buyer of Horizon. However, a bid is not thought to be likely although government sources said they were confident that the Wylfa and Oldbury sites would attract interest from other bidders. EDF stood by plans to build two new plants at Hinkley Point in Somerset, with hopes to open the first in 2019, but a final investment decision is contingent on the government underwriting long-term electricity prices. EDF and other nuclear power companies are wary of investing multibillion pound sums in facilities without a guarantee on how quickly their investments will be paid off. The French state-controlled company, which is building the stations in partnership with British gas owner Centrica, used the Horizon news to step up the pressure on government over financial support on Thursday. It made clear the consequences on the Hinkley Point project of failing to provide adequate financial assistance. It said: \"Clearly that decision depends on having a profitable project which meets the financial targets.\" One analyst said uncertainty over returns on investments and doubts over reform of the electricity market were contributing to an uncertain outlook for an energy industry that will lose large amounts of capacity over the next decade when older coal and nuclear plants – representing 20% of capacity – shut down over the next ten years. \"The UK's future energy outlook is quickly moving from uncertain to fragile. There needs to be a replacement for the Horizon consortia and quickly,\" said Andrew Horstead, a risk analyst at Utilyx, an energy consultancy. The energy minister, Charles Hendry, said the \"disappointing\" decision did not reflect badly on Britain's nuclear policy. \"The partners have clearly explained that this decision was based on pressures elsewhere in their businesses, and not any doubts about the role of nuclear in UK's energy future,\" he said. \"The UK's new nuclear programme is far more than one consortium and there remains considerable interest. Plans from EDF/Centrica and Nugen are on track and Horizon's sites offer new players an excellent ready-made opportunity to enter the market.\" The TUC said the RWE and E.ON move was a \"major jobs blow\" for the construction and engineering sectors. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said: \"If you think nuclear power has an important role in decarbonising the economy, as ministers say, then you have to make sure that these kinds of very long-term investments occur.You cannot let your strategy for dealing with climate change – our biggest long-term challenge – be subject to the short-term whims of the market.\" The Institute of Directors said the withdrawal was \"bad news\" for the future of stable energy supplies in the UK. \"Without enough reliable and affordable power to underpin our economy, businesses will find it harder to deliver growth. This decision is disappointing, and the Government needs a far better energy strategy to ensure the lights stay on and the factories keep running,\" said Simon Walker, director general of the IoD. The Horizon news also raises questions over E.ON's and RWE's bills to UK consumers. High bills have been justified by the need to finance major investments in nuclear power. That explanation faces challenges in the wake of today's news. RWE owns npower in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/21/david-cameron-green-crap-comments-storm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-21T22:04:40Z","webTitle":"David Cameron at centre of 'get rid of all the green crap' storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/21/david-cameron-green-crap-comments-storm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/21/david-cameron-green-crap-comments-storm","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron at centre of 'get rid of all the green crap' storm","bodyText":"David Cameron was at the centre of a storm on Thursday over whether he ordered aides to \"get rid of all the green crap\" from energy bills in a drive to bring down costs. The language, attributed to Cameron in the Sun newspaper by a senior Tory source, sparked a furious reaction from campaigners accusing the prime minister of abandoning his promise to run the greenest government ever. Although Downing Street said it did not \"recognise\" the phrase as one used by the prime minister, Cameron's team has not explicitly denied that he had ever referred to environmental policies as \"green crap\". The Sun quoted an unnamed source as saying: \"The prime minister is going round Number 10 saying: 'We have got to get rid of all this green crap'. He is totally focused on it. \"We used to say: 'Vote blue, go green', now it's: 'Vote blue, get real'.\" The row sparked a fresh coalition spat over green issues, following Liberal Democrat outrage about Cameron's announcement that he wanted to \"roll back\" green costs on bills last month. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, said his party would not allow the coalition's green credentials to be watered down. \"Anyone who thinks we should get rid of that is full of crap,\" the senior Lib Dem told broadcasters. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, sounded a more conciliatory note, saying environmental costs \"isn't all green crap\". He also told LBC 97.3 Radio that believes the phrase is not a fair reflection of the prime minister's views, while defending the need to subsidise renewable energy. \"It is worth remembering that a lot of the policies that we have got support tens of thousands of people who work in the booming green energy sector, actually keep bills down in the long run because if you don't insulate people's homes today they are going to be spending more on their gas and electricity bills in the future heating their homes,\" he said. The row comes after Cameron promised to roll back green costs, which currently make up £112 of the average bill, amid concerns about record household energy bills of more than £1,400 a year. He made the announcement last month after Ed Miliband told the Labour party conference that he would freeze energy bills for 18 months, putting pressure on the coalition over the cost of living. Any move that undermines the UK's environmental commitments and targets on tackling climate change will be fiercely resisted by green groups. Craig Bennett, campaigns director for Friends of the Earth, said: \"It would come as little surprise if David Cameron did tell aides to ditch the 'green crap' – his government has been attacking environmental policies for years. The reality is that protecting the planet and building a strong economy are two sides of the same coin. \"The best way to protect cash-strapped households from soaring fuel bills is to end the nation's dependency on increasingly costly gas by investing in energy efficiency and home-grown renewable power.\" Joss Garman, deputy political director at Greenpeace, said Cameron is \"sorely mistaken\" if he thinks the road to electoral victory will be found in attacking the very policies that he once passionately advocated. \"The British electorate are a sophisticated bunch who will see through his chameleon tendencies and conclude this attack is not an act of leadership but one of cowardice as he panders to the extreme wing of his own party and tries to claw back support from Ukip,\" he said. On Twitter, Zac Goldsmith, a Tory MP and environmental supporter, reported House of Commons \"tea room chat\" saying: \"If the PM can casually drop something that was so central to his identity, he can drop anything.\" Cameron appeared keen to stress the coalition's environmental record as he met supporters of the HS2 rail project outside Downing Street on Thursday morning. \"We have got the world's first green investment bank, we have got great support for our green technology industries. We have got the first nuclear power station since 1995. This is a government investing in important green technologies,\" he said. There is likely to more detail about the Treasury's plans to bring down energy bills in next month's autumn statement about which green taxes will be axed or moved into general taxation. More than half are linked to schemes to cut energy usage among the poor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2013/nov/01/womens-institute-craft-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-01T18:37:52Z","webTitle":"Women's Institute's new wave crafts its own politics in crochet and patchwork","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/01/womens-institute-craft-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/01/womens-institute-craft-politics","fields":{"headline":"Women's Institute's new wave crafts its own politics in crochet and patchwork","bodyText":"'It's always been a feminist organisation, but I think maybe when it started it was stealth feminism.\" Caroline Brooks, 34, is a member of the Sewing Bee, which is a sub-group of the Shoreditch Sisters, which is at the vanguard of the Women's Institute new wave. They meet near Haggerston and they were established in 2007 by Jazz Domino Holly, who founded Sew Out of Control (a website where crafts meet rock'n'roll) and (the following information is not relevant to the WI) is the daughter of Joe Strummer. It all sounds a bit cool. \"I'm sick of us being labelled as being cool, because we're really not,\" Caroline says. \"And I don't like the look on people's faces when they meet us and realise that,\" Madeline Colborn, 26, adds. They sew, but they also knit (at Knit and Natter), and cycle (with Radiant Riders), and taste beer (Swig for Victory). They have a radio show on Hoxton Radio. There is much more stitching them together, though, than their shared activities and love of alliteration. They're all friends, but it's more than organised friendship. There is a palpable likemindedness, a set of shared assumptions that go beyond \"I assume you're going to put some Tunisian crochet in that patchwork quilt.\" I don't really get it; I don't understand how you campaign about issues, and agree on those issues, without having an articulated political standpoint. But they understand it, and they're the ones campaigning; as WI has been for years. Martha Wass, the 25-year-old president of the group, was in the middle of making a fascinator. Elsewhere, I saw someone crocheting a bra, which should really be new grist to the mill of bra-based feminist disparagement. \"I met the Shoreditch Sisters at an event,\" says Martha. \"I've never met a nicer group of people in my life. They had so much to say, they were so intelligent. And I can't think you'd find that in a dance class, or a gym.\" For some, there is a straight altruistic curve, between crafting and co-operating. Thirty-five-year-old Jamila (\"I thought I was going to be the youngest member by two decades. It turns out I'm actually mid-range\") describes it: \"If I've got a skill, I want to pass it on.\" For others, it's a symbiotic process; a campaigning idea might be expressed through craft – let's say you're making a patchwork quilt out of embroidered vulvas, to protest against female genital mutilation – and then in the act of crafting, the idea finds new expression. Martha explains (about the vulva quilt workshop they ran for the Secret Cinema): \"People are attracted to it, they want to make, they sit down, they get their things, and then we start to talk. And then they get to know all about FGM, and what's happening.\" And this, she underlines, has always been part of the WI – it is truly astonishing what you'll find in their booklet of resolutions: \"In view of the recent nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, this meeting urges the government world to declare a moratorium on the development of nuclear power\"; as early as 1943, they were calling for equal pay. But lest you mistake this for lefties in craft-clothing, it was not all progressive. In 1952, the motion was passed: \"This meeting remembers that our young queen had duties as a wife and mother and urges the nation as a whole not to overwork her majesty.\" \"We probably still haven't achieved that,\" said Madeline. \"She works like a dog.\" And beyond the clear trajectory, whereby nice people just inexorably do nice things for the less fortunate, there is a profound philosophical point. Caroline says, \"That was the big generational divide, between our mothers and their mothers: sod this, I'm going to buy everything, versus make do and mend. We have more in common with earlier generations than we do with baby boomers, we just don't have their plenty. \"I'm anti-consumerist, not pro-thrift. I love clothes but I don't want disposable clothes.

Only six days earlier Richard had rescued a young boy who had slipped into the flood waters and was in danger of being swept into the weir. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: • River levels on the Thames and Severn are likely to rise again over the next few days, but the worst of the flooding appears to be over, according to the Environment Agency. Sixteen severe flood warnings remain in place for a second week in Somerset and the Thames Valley. • David Cameron described flooding as a “tragedy” as he pledged to visit every flood-hit area of the country. On a visit to Upton-upon-Severn he also confirmed some of the details of a £10m package to aid flood-hit businesses. • New damage to the tide-battered seawall at Dawlish looks set to delay the reopening of the line until April, Network Rail has warned. Last week the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that repair to the line would be completed by 18 March. But the latest damage means this deadline is to be extended by up to two weeks. • The Met Office has issued another amber “be prepared” warning for rain in south-west England on Monday with up to 40mm expected in some already saturated areas. But the outlook for the rest of week is for more settled weather. • Flood-stricken communities, including those visited previously by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, have been left without planned defences following government funding cuts, the Guardian can reveal. Undelivered defences, totalling many millions of pounds, also include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. • Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, claims George Osborne, was the driving force behind the cuts in flood defence spending in 2010. The chancellor was then forced to increase flood defence spending last June because insurance companies were threatening to withdraw cover for 350,000 homes at risk, Huhne writes in article in the Guardian. • Soldiers have complete 600m-long aqua dam, known as the Chertsey Sausage, along the Thames but some residents of the Surrey town question its effectiveness. For those who live on the other side of it, and whose homes back on to the river, it is too little, too late. They feel their properties, which have already been flooded, are being abandoned to the waters and fear they could find themselves trapped. River levels on the Thames and Severn are likely to rise again over the next few days, according to the Environment Agency. Katharine Evans, the agency’s flood risk manager, suggested that the worst of the floods appeared to be over for now, but that exceptionally high levels of ground water could pose problems for months to come. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, she said: We’ve got further rainfall forecast, but it looks as if some of that is going to fall away from the places where we are having problems at the moment. We will certainly see rainfall push up river levels, particularly on the Thames and the Severn over the next two/three days, but we are not expecting them to be any worse than the ones we’ve seen previously. Evans said high levels of ground water were causing significant problems in the south-west and south-east of England. Kent, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset are all seeing problems of really high ground water which is either coming out of dry springs and turning those into rivers and coming out of the ground in various spots, or it is actually flowing into major rivers and causing those to rise. It is very widespread ... Ground water is one we are going to have to keep an eye on for weeks if not months. Liam Dutton, the weather forecaster for Channel 4 News, explains why river levels still rise after the rain has stopped falling. In the case of the River Thames, it can take around two to three days for rain water in the upper part of the river to flow downstream to the lower part of the river. So, in effect, the rising of the rivers during today and tomorrow will be as a result of the rain that fell a few days ago. Devon and Cornwall police have released aerial images of the new damage to the seawall at Dawlish. They show that the row of rubble filled shipping containers used as makeshift barrier were battered by Friday’s storm but still in place. The latest damage is likely to set back the completion of the repair of main south-west railway line until April. David Cameron continues to try give the impression of being on top of the crisis by visiting more areas hit by flooding and has promised more trips to come. Upton-upon-Severn is the latest stop on the prime minister’s flood tour. Cameron said he will aim to visit every flood-hit area around the country “to try and learn lessons”. And he defended the government’s handling of the crisis and hit back at criticism that he was visiting places such as Upton-upon-Severn only after the damage had already been done. PA quoted him saying: I’ll try to get to every part of the country that’s been affected so that we can learn all the lessons. But here in Worcestershire we can recognise that the flood investment that went in after 2007 has made a real difference, with hundreds of properties protected.” The Met Office has issued another amber “be prepared” warning for rain in south-west England with up to 40mm expected in some already saturated areas. It said: Another spell of rain is expected across southwest England during Monday. This is not expected to be as prolonged or as heavy as in recent days but given the saturated ground, the public should be aware that this still has the potential either to lead to localised flooding or to exacerbate existing issues. Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 mm seem likely quite widely and perhaps 30 to 40 mm locally, mainly over high ground in the west of the warning area. The reasons for installing the 600m Chertsey Sausage are clearer from the air than street level. Thames police have release this aerial view of the Aqua Dam alongside the flooded river banks. Greenpeace is calling for environment secretary Owen Paterson to be sacked over the decision to put flood defences on hold. In the letter to David Cameron, Greenpeace chief executive John Sauven, said: “We believe very strongly that Owen Paterson is failing the responsibilities of his office and we need to see someone put in charge who believes in an evidence-led approach to climate change.” The letter complained about the decision to cut flood defence budgets. To highlight the issue Greenpeace moored a rowing boat with a spitting image style Owen Paterson puppet marooned on the Thames directly outside the Houses of Parliament. Jimmy Aldridge, Greenpeace climate campaigner added: “Owen Paterson, has slashed the budget of the Environment Agency against the advice of his own experts, and delayed projects that could have protected more homes, businesses and farmland from flooding. Paterson’s not just incompetent, he’s irresponsible and dangerous.” The prime minister has announced the details of a package of measures to help flood-hit businesses. It includes a £10m hardship fund, a relaxation of the penalties for the late filing of accounts, and a helpline. Announcing the move Cameron said: “The government is taking action across the board to deal with the clear-up and help hard-working people affected by the floods.” New damage to the tide-battered seawall at Dawlish looks set to delay the reopening of the line until April, Network Rail has warned. On Friday another exceptionally high tide disturbed some of the rubble-filled shipping containers set up as a makeshift tidal barrier where an 80m stretch propping up the main south-west rail line was washed away earlier this month. Last week the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that repair to the line would be completed by 18 March. But the latest damage means this deadline is to be extended by up to two weeks, according to BBC News citing a Network Rail spokesman. Lee Edworthy, regional manager for First Great Western, confirmed the damage in a Twitter update. Devon and Cornwall police said there would be an inspection of the damage this morning. The Thames barrier is due to close for the 20th consecutive time today on its current record breaking run of tidal closures. John Curtin, the Environment Agency’s head of incident management, points out that this winter’s closures alone make up a quarter of total closures in the barrier’s 32 year history. Update: The Environment Agency later corrected this figure by saying there had been 165 closures since 1982, but that still means that almost a quarter of the total closures have occurred this winter. During Sunday’s closure there was 2.5m difference between the tidal water being held back and the swollen flow from upstream. Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell imagines troops being air dropped onto the Somerset Levels after they turned up last week in Wraysbury without the right footwear. Labour leader Ed Miliband has echoed his comments to the Observer about how the floods demonstrate what will happen if we don’t tackle climate change. In an interview on ITV’s Daybreak programme, he said: “What I fear is if we don’t act this is just a grim foretaste of what’s going to come.” The Observer reported Miliband saying: “The science is clear. The public know there is a problem. But, because of political division in Westminster, we are sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change.” He also called for “decent people” in the Tory party and the Liberal Democrats to join the cause, “to come forward and say, we can’t have this ambivalence any more because it will be disastrous for this country”. Miliband’s remarks prompted climate change minister Greg Barker to claim that Labour’s front bench has failed to ask a single question about climate change in the last two years. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the floods crisis. The worst of the winter storms may have passed, but more rain is forecast and 16 severe flood warnings remain in place for second week. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: • Sixteen severe flood warnings remain in place for a second week in Somerset and the Thames Valley as still more rain is forecast. The Environment Agency said the overall picture is starting to improve as river levels stabilise, but added that there is still a risk to people and property remain. • David Cameron has described flooding as a “tragedy” as he prepared to visit more of the worst affected areas. He also confirmed some of the details of a £10m package to aid flood-hit businesses. • Flood-stricken communities, including those visited previously by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, have been left without planned defences following government funding cuts, the Guardian can reveal. Undelivered defences, totalling many millions of pounds, also include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. • Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, claims George Osborne, was the driving force behind the cuts in flood defence spending in 2010. The chancellor was then forced to increase flood defence spending last June because insurance companies were threatening to withdraw cover for 350,000 homes at risk, Huhne writes in article in the Guardian. • An extra 5,000 troops are on standby to support communities hit by flooding. Defence secretary Philip Hammond said 3,000 troops were currently deployed, and another 5,000 were available. He admitted the armed forces could have been despatched earlier to help. • The under-fire chairman of the Environment Agency, Chris Smith, welcomed the prime minister’s pledge of unlimited funds for flood relief but called for the same approach to be to extended to flood defences. “I hope he will apply the same principle to the longer-term issues about improving our flood defences. One of the things that has worried me is whether flood defence is seen by the Treasury as a high enough priority,” he told the Guardian. • The widow of a man killed when a freak wave hit a cruise ship in the Channel has criticised the “badly maintained” vessel. James Swinstead, 85, a father of two from Colchester, Essex, died after water rushed on board the British cruise ship Marco Polo as it was battered by waves during Friday’s severe storms. His widow, Helen, said: “I think the shipping company should give some sort of compensation. The ship was badly maintained. Four windows blew.” • Soldiers have complete 600m-long aqua dam, known as the Chertsey Sausage, along the Thames but some residents of the Surrey town question its effectiveness. For those who live on the other side of it, and whose homes back on to the river, it is too little, too late.

Nothing remarkable in that, except that the energy analyst and chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) does not live in the tropics but in an unheated house 6,500 feet up a mountain near Aspen, Colorado, where the temperature falls to -44C and where last week more than two feet of snow fell in less than 24 hours. The fruit is grown in a greenhouse that is part of the sprawling, experimental, super-insulated house at Old Snowmass, built 30 years ago for $500,000 (£300,000) and an inspiration for a generation of energy thinkers, designers and sustainable builders. Visited by 100,000 people, it was the archetype for the European Passivhaus movement. \"Heating systems are so 20th century,\" he says. \"We have found you actually save money by not putting in a heating system. It's cheaper. The monitoring system uses more energy than the lights.\" On a visit to the Caribbean where the RMI is working with Carbon War Room NGO to help island states wean themselves off expensive diesel-generated electricity, Lovins recalls a visit in the mid-1980s from the originators of the Passivhaus idea, Bo Adamson of Sweden and Wolfgang Feist from Germany. \"They realised that you could make heating systems far smaller but they hadn't realised that you could save energy by eliminating the heating kit completely.\" Lovins has always maintained that energy conservation not only pays for itself, but that energy-saving technology can lead to higher quality of life at lower cost. He has advised many of the world's largest companies and dozens of countries how to reduce bills with renewables but has also challenged the giant car, aviation and construction industries to rethink the way they operate. Thirty years since moving to Colorado from Britain, where he was Friends of the Earth's first-ever employee, the 66-year-old sees the energy revolution which he helped kick-start with a series of academic and policy papers now in full swing. \"Since 2008, half the world's added electrical generating capacity has been renewable. Non hydro-electric renewables, chiefly wind and solar, were 49% of US and 69% of European capacity added last year. \"In three of the world's top four economies, China, Japan and Germany, there was more generation of electricity from non-hydro renewables than from nuclear in 2012.\" Renewables have scaled up incredibly fast, he says. \"Worldwide it is faster than mobile phones. More Kenyans now get first electricity now from solar than the grid. China got more generation from wind in 2012 than from nuclear and it added more generation from non-hydro renewable energy than fossil and nuclear combined. It is now the world leader in seven of the 10 renewable energies and wants to be top in all 10. It appears to have added 12GW of photovoltaics in 2012 – that's more than the total that have been installed in the US.\" The US, which lagged behind for years, is shifting, too, he says. \"The US is a giant laboratory. Different states are going at different speeds. Texas is best for wind, it now gets 10% of its energy from wind because it's good at business; Hawaii is ground zero, with one in 10 households now with a PV system. \"The energy intensity of the US economy has declined 50% in 10 years, mostly because of better design. In 2012 the energy used to make a dollar of GDP went down by 3.4% in one year. We can see a very clear way forward to trebling energy efficiency by 2050.\" Most encouraging, he says, is that 14 states for electricity and 20 for natural gas now reward consumers for cutting bills. \"That is the reverse of the use of electricity as a commodity. Electricity is an infrastructure, not a commodity. We need to reward the provider to give you lower bills\". Twenty years ago, Lovins proposed what he called the \"Hypercar\", a hybrid electric/hydrogen-fuelled family vehicle that had only a few parts, was made of lightweight carbon but was stronger than steel, used existing technologies, weighed half a normal car of its size, and could travel the equivalent of 300 miles to the gallon. It was designed to have next to no emissions and, using its batteries, could become a power plant on wheels when parked, eliminating the need for nuclear or coal-power stations. 2014, says Lovins, sees the commercial birth of the Hypercar, with the arrival of the all-carbon electric BMW i-3 family and the 313 miles per gallon Volkswagon XL1 with emissions of just 20g/km. \"The car industry is notoriously slow to change,\" he says, but \"you could say the era of the hyper car is starting now.\" The most exciting energy conservation advances may be in the way new technologies and business models can be combined, he believes. He was the first to suggest that cars, which are on average used for just an hour a day, be used to generate and store electricity and then be able to despatch it back to the grid. \"Suppose I am a carmaker and I have two identical plug-in cars, one for £5,000 less than the other. Suppose that the car maker can use the battery of the cheaper one to sell to the grid at peak times … in other words a car-maker can profit from your stationary car.\" \"In the future I see radically cheap renewable energy and storage, new types of battery, super-windows, cheap ways to instal LEDs in large buildings to eliminate wiring, many advances in insulating materials, smart thermostats that learn what comfort you want and buildings that do not need heating or cooling.\" But despite all the advances in technology and business models, Lovins weeps for Britain, where he lived for 12 years during and after a spell at Oxford University. He led the successful opposition in the 1970s to stop Rio Tinto digging up Snowdonia with a massive mine. \"Britain's plan for a fleet of new nuclear power stations is … unbelievable,\" he says. \"It is economically daft. The guaranteed price [being offered to French state company EDF] is over seven times the unsubsidised price of new wind in the US, four or five times the unsubsidised price of new solar power in the US. Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.\" In the end, he says, \"economics tends to win over stupid policy. The energy revolution is under way but there are decades of playing out to be done. It's both encouraging and frustrating that it's not going faster. This work requires relentless patience.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/23/nuclear-power-plant-sites-released","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-23T11:22:44Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power plant site plans released by government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/23/nuclear-power-plant-sites-released","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/23/nuclear-power-plant-sites-released","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power plant site plans released by government","bodyText":"The government has pushed ahead with plans for new nuclear power plants in the UK, as it confirmed a list of eight sites where the next generation of reactors can be built. The eight sites are: Bradwell, Essex; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, south Gloucestershire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk; and Wylfa, Anglesey. All are adjacent to existing nuclear sites. It is the first major announcement on the future of nuclear power in the UK since the Fukushima disaster in Japan. The energy and climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, had signalled last month that plans for new reactors in the UK were on track after an initial report on Fukushima from nuclear chief inspector Mike Weightman ruled out the need to curtail the operation of stations in the UK. The plans for new nuclear power plants are part of a series of national policy statements on energy that were published on Thursday, following public consultation. They will be debated and voted on in parliament, but ministers are hopeful that, with a pro-nuclear majority in the Commons, they will win. The energy minister, Charles Hendry, said: \"These plans set out our energy need to help guide the planning process, so that if acceptable proposals come forward in appropriate places, they will not face unnecessary hold ups.\" Nuclear power is one of the issues that divided Conservatives and Liberal Democrats when they entered government, with the coalition deal allowing Lib Dem MPs to abstain. Huhne, a Lib Dem, has since given his backing to new reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/jun/27/coalition-teamwork-greenest-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T15:05:37Z","webTitle":"Does the coalition have the teamwork to be the greenest government? | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/jun/27/coalition-teamwork-greenest-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/jun/27/coalition-teamwork-greenest-government","fields":{"headline":"Does the coalition have the teamwork to be the greenest government?","bodyText":"It turns out that the coalition government does, after all, have the desire to be the \"greenest ever\". The question now is whether they have the teamwork to complete the journey. Their challenge is to complete an arduous expedition in that unknown territory called the future, with unfamiliar kit and no reliable map. Ministers must arrive at the destination of a clean energy system fit for the 21st century and sharply lower carbon emissions, while keeping the lights on, energy bills affordable and all the time protecting both people and the natural world from harm. Thursday's announcements provide a thicket of signposts and flares about the direction of travel, but the brightest burning of them all – an apparent bonanza of shale gas under our feet – is far from the most important. Better indicators of progress are the broadly positive moves made on nuclear power, flood defences, renewable energy and the green investment bank, as is disappointing news on the green deal energy efficiency scheme. But the hysteria over fracking – \"we're in the money\" yelled one headline – reveals starkly the way the two sides of the coalition are fighting over the compass and pulling in different directions. George Osborne and the Conservatives dream of a US-style gas revolution, energy secretary Ed Davey and the LibDems understand it is near certain not to happen. Fracking could provide a useful source of secure, domestic and relatively low-carbon fuel and could offset some of the decline in North Sea gas in a decade or so. But it won't come quick enough. As the energy regulator Ofgem warned on Thursday, the UK faces a rising risk of blackouts far sooner - within a few years. Wind turbines on land and an end to profligate wasting of electricity and gas in our homes are far better placed to get us through the energy crunch. But consider this. Ministers have pledged to make planning harder for onshore windfarms, but easier for fracking rigs. They suggest windfarm developers give £5,000 to local communities per megawatt, but require that fracking firms give £100,000 to locals for a single exploratory well, plus 1% of revenues from each production site. Most revealing of all is that, while fracking will only be acceptable if it can be done safely and without damaging water supplies or exacerbating climate change by belching out methane, ministers have completely ignored the key recommendation of the Royal Society's authoritative report on shale gas, which insisted regulatory \"guidelines specific to shale gas extraction\" must be drawn up. Environmental protection must not make fracking too expensive is the message government is sending out. The coalition stands at a fork in the road, arguing furiously. Osborne's 20th-century view of the environment as something to risk in pursuit of economic growth – £40bn on roads, for example – leads down a dark, treeless path of fossil-fuel dependency. The Lib Dem's foiled desire to end uncertainty over green investment – by committing to a carbon-free electricity system by 2030 – leads to a brighter path of sustainability. Thursday's revelations point in different directions. Full-speed ahead for the shale gas juggernaut and don't mind the pedestrians is heading down the dark road, as is Osborne's infliction of the joint-worst cuts in Whitehall to the environment department. The awful start made by the green deal scheme, becoming more middle-class boiler subsidy than national home retrofit, is also travelling in the wrong direction, though it could yet turn around. It needs to: saving energy is even more important than finding clean new ways to generate it. But other measures are pushing the coalition down the brighter path. The huge U-turn on cuts to flood defence spending means millions of people will be safer from the horrors of the deluges being intensified by global warming. Like or loathe nuclear power, the pledge by the government to guarantee loans to build the proposed new plant in Somerset means a big chunk of low-carbon energy is now more likely. High costs will be the catch there, in my estimation. Renewable energy received more certainty, which could reduce some of the crippling uncertainty that has kept investors hands in their pockets at a time when the UK's energy system is desperate for new generation. The arcane but vital capacity mechanism – ensuring enough flexible gas-powered electricity is available to iron out the peaks and troughs in carbon-free wind and solar – is now a step further forward. And the green investment bank will be allowed to borrow – a little – for the first time. On balance, the coalition now looks more likely to take the steeper but ultimately safer high road to sustainability. But this expedition into the future is a marathon not a sprint, and ministers' failure to look much beyond 2020 is still tripping them up. In the past two years, largely thanks to Osborne, this has looked like the greenest government never. After today, the journey is at least back on track and we should be grateful for that. When it comes to safeguarding the environment we all share, we really are all in it together. Note: I have clarified that wind farm developers are recommended to give £5,000 per megawatt installed, not in total. Seven 3MW turbined would mean £100,000 if firms comply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/23/philippines-devastated-unfair-debt-typhoon-haiyan","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-23T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"The Philippines is devastated as much by unfair debt as typhoon Haiyan | Tim Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/23/philippines-devastated-unfair-debt-typhoon-haiyan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/23/philippines-devastated-unfair-debt-typhoon-haiyan","fields":{"headline":"The Philippines is devastated as much by unfair debt as typhoon Haiyan","bodyText":"By Christmas Eve, the Philippines will have spent $1bn (£0.6bn) paying foreign debts in the seven weeks since typhoon Haiyan devastated much of the country. It will have spent a total of $8.4bn on foreign debt in 2013, and faces a further $8.8bn in 2014. While a little more than $100m has been pledged by international donors for relief work, more than 800 times that amount of money leaves the country every year to pay debts. The people of the Philippines have been saddled with a large debt since the 1980s, when Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who held the presidency from 1965 to 1986, was loaned large amounts by western governments and institutions such as the World Bank in order to keep him onside during the cold war. During his rule, Marcos is thought to have stolen up to $10bn of Filipino money. But after he was deposed in 1986, the lenders who were complicit in this corruption continued to demand repayment. The impact of chronic debt has been devastating for the Filipino people, with public services such as health and education persistently underfunded. Today, about 16 million Filipinos are estimated to be living in extreme poverty and malnourished. Meanwhile, more than 20% of government revenue is spent on foreign debt payments each year, almost as much as on health and education combined. In response to typhoon Haiyan, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank rapidly announced they would lend $1.9bn for emergency assistance and reconstruction. That this much-needed money will be given as loans rather than grants means the impact of the disaster will continue through another generation because of the high debt payments. By definition, loans for reconstruction cannot generate returns to enable the debt to be paid. The most they can do is return infrastructure to the state it was in before a disaster hit. As Joseph Stead from Christian Aid says: \"Debts that should have been cancelled years ago are limiting the capacity of the Philippines to respond and rebuild [after] the typhoon. Action on this is clearly needed before any new debts are added.\" But the impact of high debt payments is not the only reason Filipino debt should be cancelled. Following the end of Marcos's dictatorship, many of those who had resisted his rule formed the Freedom from Debt Coalition, calling for the non-payment of his odious debts. Loans to Marcos to build the Batan nuclear power plant – which never generated any electricity, and was built on an earthquake faultline – merely represent the most absurd example. These unjust loans continued after the fall of Marcos. In 1997, the Bank of Austria lent money for medical waste incinerators, which were already being decommissioned in Europe because of their high level of pollution and would be banned in the Philippines within two years. In 2008, the Freedom from Debt Coalition got the Philippines Congress to agree to suspend payments on these and 10 other loans, but this decision was vetoed by Gloria Arroyo, the president at the time. The UK government also played a role in the accumulation of useless debt. In the 2000s, UK Export Finance, part of the Department for Business, guaranteed loans for the purchase of bridges from British company Mabey and Johnson. Local campaigners said many of the bridges went nowhere, leading into the middle of fields or connecting up mud tracks. Mabey and Johnson were later convicted of paying bribes to win projects in six developing countries: Jamaica, Ghana, Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique and Bangladesh. The Philippines was excluded from international debt relief schemes because, with an annual income of £1,600 a person, it was adjudged \"too rich\" by governments. Consequently, the country remains trapped in a debt cycle where payments limit government investments, preventing repayment of the debt. Over the past 40 years, the Philippines government has been loaned $115bn and has repaid $132bn in principal sums and interest. However, it is still said to owe $60bn. This cycle is now being exacerbated by climate change, as the strength of typhoons and the damage they cause increases. Richer governments have consistently refused to meet obligations, agreed in 1992 (pdf), to compensate developing countries for the damaging impact of their greenhouse gas emissions. Even where limited funds are being given, these often come in the form of loans. For example, alongside a grant of £70m, the UK government is lending £255m through the World Bank for climate change adaptation projects. This includes lending money to the Caribbean island of Grenada, even though it is already in default and unable to pay its huge debts. \"Justice for the Filipino people demands debt cancellation,\" says Ricardo Reyes of the Freedom from Debt Coalition. \"Climate justice demands reparations to enable the Philippines to develop resilience to climate change and compensation for losses and damages.\" Where debts are out of control, fail to protect basic human rights, or come from odious loans for damaging or failed projects – all of which is true of the Philippines – they should be cancelled. And as climate change gets worse, the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions have a moral duty to compensate those who are most impacted, and to do so with grants, not loans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/may/29/fukushima-inquiry-naoto-kan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-29T07:13:01Z","webTitle":"Fukushima inquiry: I felt helpless, says former PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/fukushima-inquiry-naoto-kan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/29/fukushima-inquiry-naoto-kan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima inquiry: I felt helpless, says former PM","bodyText":"Japan's prime minister at the height of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis has admitted he often felt \"helpless\" during the early days of the disaster, adding that the facility's triple meltdown had brought the country close to \"national collapse\". Speaking at a parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the incident on Monday, Naoto Kan urged Japan to abandon nuclear power, as the industry attempts to bring closed reactors back into operation. Kan, who resigned last September amid criticism of his handling of the crisis, has become one of Japan's most vocal opponents of nuclear power. His successor, Yoshihiko Noda, has argued in favour of restarting reactors deemed safe to avoid electricity shortages this summer. In comments that were among the most eagerly awaited in the six-month public enquiry, Kan said inadequate explanations from nuclear officials drafted in to brief him on the situation at the plant had only increased his sense of fear. He reserved his harshest criticism for officials from the nuclear and industrial safety agency, the country's main regulatory body. \"I was frightened and felt helpless,\" he told the panel, set up after a previous government investigation was criticised as timid. \"You can't expect a nuclear expert to be prime minister or a cabinet minister, so we need top regulatory officials to provide expertise and help us. We didn't have those people.\" He pointed to fundamental weaknesses in Japan's readiness to deal with a disaster as serious as the 14-metre tsunami that caused three of Fukushima Daiichi's reactors to go into meltdown. A law to improve the country's ability to address a nuclear disaster introduced after a fatal accident at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura in 1999 was found wanting, he said. \"Everything anticipated in the law was inadequate, and we had to endure all kinds of trouble that we could have done without,\" he said. Assessments of the aftermath of Fukushima tell a story of confusion at the site, and a lack of communication between Tepco, safety officials and the government. The accident has fuelled criticism of the \"nuclear village\" – regulators, utilities, bureaucrats and pro-nuclear scientists – who, Kan said, were again working together to restart reactors despite local concerns over safety. Long-awaited reform of the safety agency has been held up by opposition parties, which have demanded that the new body be given more independence from the nuclear agency. Kan denounced close ties between power companies and their regulators as \"the root of the illness\" whose symptoms became most apparent during the Fukushima crisis. But he added: \"The nuclear accident was caused by a nuclear plant that operated as national policy, so I believe the biggest portion of blame lies with the state.\" His testimony shed light on the disarray at the heart of the small group of officials tasked with leading Japan's emergency response, but it failed to resolve accusations that Kan's actions in the immediate aftermath had worsened the situation. He said Tepco and the nuclear safety agency had hidden key details from him in the days after 11 March, adding that he had been as open as possible with the public based on the information he had been given. Kan said he had feared further meltdowns that could result in the evacuation of Tokyo – a metropolitan area of more than 30 million people. Deserting the capital, he added, would have brought the government to a standstill and led to \"a collapse of the nation's ability to function\". He defended his demand that Tepco officials remain on duty after being told that the firm planned to evacuate its staff from the plant. The company has claimed that it never intended to abandon the facility, but would have retained a core of engineers to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Kan also defended his hastily arranged visit to the plant the day after the tsunami, dismissing accusations that his presence hindered the operation to prevent catastrophic meltdown during its most critical phase. Kan said he had decided to talk to the plant's manager, Masao Yoshida, directly because officials in Tokyo had provided only sketchy information. He disputed Tepco's claims that he had ordered the utility to stop injecting seawater into the stricken reactors to keep them cool. Yoshida, who took early retirement last year after being diagnosed with cancer, ignored the order and has been credited with preventing an even worse accident. Kan's opposition to nuclear power has not weakened since his resignation. Citing the risk of a \"national collapse\" from a similar accident in future, he said the Fukushima crisis had convinced him that \"the best way to make nuclear power plants safe is not to depend on them, but not to have them at all\". Noda, meanwhile, is expected to decide soon whether to order the restart of two reactors in Oi, western Japan, amid fears of a power shortfall during the height of the summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries | Claire Provost and Matt Kennard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid","fields":{"headline":"The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries","bodyText":"Luis Parada’s office is just four blocks from the White House, in the heart of K Street, Washington’s lobbying row – a stretch of steel and glass buildings once dubbed the “road to riches”, when influence-peddling became an American growth industry. Parada, a soft-spoken 55-year-old from El Salvador, is one of a handful of lawyers in the world who specialise in defending sovereign states against lawsuits lodged by multinational corporations. He is the lawyer for the defence in an obscure but increasingly powerful field of international law – where foreign investors can sue governments in a network of tribunals for billions of dollars. Fifteen years ago, Parada’s work was a minor niche even within the legal business. But since 2000, hundreds of foreign investors have sued more than half of the world’s countries, claiming damages for a wide range of government actions that they say have threatened their profits. In 2006, Ecuador cancelled an oil-exploration contract with Houston-based Occidental Petroleum; in 2012, after Occidental filed a suit before an international investment tribunal, Ecuador was ordered to pay a record $1.8bn – roughly equal to the country’s health budget for a year. (Ecuador has logged a request for the decision to be annulled.) Parada’s first case was defending Argentina in the late 1990s against the French conglomerate Vivendi, which sued after the Argentine province of Tucuman stepped in to limit the price it charged people for water and wastewater services. Argentina eventually lost, and was ordered to pay the company more than $100m. Now, in his most high-profile case yet, Parada is part of the team defending El Salvador as it tries to fend off a multimillion-dollar suit lodged by a multinational mining company after the tiny Central American country refused to allow it to dig for gold. The suit was filed in 2009 by a Canadian company, Pacific Rim – later bought by an Australian mining firm, OceanaGold – which said it had been encouraged by the government of El Salvador to spend “tens of millions of dollars to undertake mineral exploration activities”. But, the company alleged that when valuable deposits of gold and silver were discovered, the government, for political reasons, withheld the permits it needed to begin digging. The company’s claim, which at one point exceeded $300m, has since been reduced to $284m – still more than the total amount of foreign aid El Salvador received last year. El Salvador countered that the company not only lacked environmental permits but also failed to prove it had obtained rights to much of the land covered by its request: many farmers in the northern Cabañas region, where the company wanted to dig, had refused to sell their land. Every year on 15 September, thousands of Salvadorans celebrate the date when much of Central America gained independence from Spain. Fireworks are set off and marching bands parade through villages across the country. But, last year, in the town of San Isidro, in Cabañas, the festivities had a markedly different tone. Hundreds had gathered to protest against the mine. Gold mines often use cyanide to separate gold from ore, and widespread concern over already severe water contamination in El Salvador has helped fuel a powerful movement determined to keep the country’s minerals in the ground. In the central square, colourful banners were strung up, calling on OceanaGold to drop its case against the country and leave the area. Many were adorned with the slogan, “No a la mineria, Si a la vida” (No to mining, Yes to life). On the same day, in Washington DC, Parada gathered his notes and shuffled into a suite of nondescript meeting rooms in the World Bank’s J building, across the street from its main headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. This is the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID): the primary institution for handling the cases that companies file against sovereign states. (The ICSID is not the sole venue for such cases; there are similar forums in London, Paris, Hong Kong and the Hague, among others.) The date of the hearing was not a coincidence, Parada said. The case has been framed in El Salvador as a test of the country’s sovereignty in the 21st century, and he suggested that it should be heard on Independence Day. “The ultimate question in this case,” he said, “is whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor as opposed to the investor complying with the laws they find in the country.” Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals grant foreign investors the right to activate this system, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), if they want to challenge government decisions affecting their investments. In Europe, this system has become a sticking point in negotiations over the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal proposed between the European Union and the US, which would massively extend its scope and power and make it harder to challenge in the future. Both France and Germany have said that they want access to investor-state dispute settlement removed from the TTIP treaty currently under discussion. Investors have used this system not only to sue for compensation for alleged expropriation of land and factories, but also over a huge range of government measures, including environmental and social regulations, which they say infringe on their rights. Multinationals have sued to recover money they have already invested, but also for alleged lost profits and “expected future profits”. The number of suits filed against countries at the ICSID is now around 500 – and that figure is growing at an average rate of one case a week. The sums awarded in damages are so vast that investment funds have taken notice: corporations’ claims against states are now seen as assets that can be invested in or used as leverage to secure multimillion-dollar loans. Increasingly, companies are using the threat of a lawsuit at the ICSID to exert pressure on governments not to challenge investors’ actions. “I had absolutely no idea this was coming,” Parada said. Sitting in a glass-walled meeting room in his offices, at the law firm Foley Hoag, he paused, searching for the right word to describe what has happened in his field. “Rogue,” he decided, finally. “I think the investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue.” * * * The quiet village of Moorburg in Germany lies just across the river from Hamburg. Past the 16th-century church and meadows rich with wildflowers, two huge chimneys spew a steady stream of thick, grey smoke into the sky. This is Kraftwerk Moorburg, a new coal-fired power plant – the village’s controversial next-door neighbour. In 2009, it was the subject of a €1.4bn investor-state case filed by Vattenfall, the Swedish energy giant, against the Federal Republic of Germany. It is a prime example of how this powerful international legal system, built to protect foreign investors in developing countries, is now being used to challenge the actions of European governments as well. Since the 1980s, German investors have sued dozens of countries, including Ghana, Ukraine and the Philippines, at the World Bank’s Centre in Washington DC. But with the Vattenfall case, Germany found itself in the dock for the first time. The irony was not lost on those who considered Germany to be the grandfather of investor-state arbitration: it was a group of German businessmen, in the late 1950s, who first conceived of a way to protect their overseas investments as a wave of developing countries gained independence from European colonial powers. Led by Deutsche Bank chairman Hermann Abs, they called their proposal an “international magna carta” for private investors. In the 1960s, the idea was taken up by the World Bank, which said that such a system could help the world’s poorer countries attract foreign capital. “I am convinced,” the World Bank president George Woods said at the time, “that those … who adopt as their national policy a welcome [environment] for international investment – and that means, to mince no words about it, giving foreign investors a fair opportunity to make attractive profits – will achieve their development objectives more rapidly than those who do not.” At the World Bank’s 1964 annual meeting in Tokyo, it approved a resolution to set up a mechanism for handling investor-state cases. The first line of the ICSID Convention’s preamble sets out its goal as “international cooperation for economic development”. There was sharp opposition to this system from its inception, with a bloc of developing countries warning that it would undermine their sovereignty. A group of 21 countries – almost every Latin American country, plus Iraq and the Philippines – voted against the proposal in Tokyo. But the World Bank moved ahead regardless. Andreas Lowenfeld, an American legal academic who was involved in some of these early discussions, later remarked: “I believe this was the first time that a major resolution of the World Bank had been pressed forward with so much opposition.” Global development remains the ICSID’s stated goal. “The idea,” said the institution’s current secretary-general, Meg Kinnear, “is if an investor feels that there is a fair, impartial mechanism should they ever get to a dispute, then they will have that much more confidence and it will help to promote investment … and when you invest in a country you obviously bring jobs, revenue, technology and the like.” But now governments are discovering, too late, the true price of that confidence. The Kraftwerk Moorburg plant was controversial long before the case was filed. For years, local residents and environmental groups objected to its construction, amid growing concern over climate change and the impact the project would have on the Elbe river. In 2008, Vattenfall was granted a water permit for its Moorburg project, but, in response to local pressure, local authorities imposed strict environmental conditions to limit the utility’s water usage and its impact on fish. Vattenfall sued Hamburg in the local courts. But, as a foreign investor, it was also able to file a case at the ICSID. These environmental measures, it said, were so strict that they constituted a violation of its rights as guaranteed by the Energy Charter Treaty, a multilateral investment agreement signed by more than 50 countries, including Sweden and Germany. It claimed that the environmental conditions placed on its permit were so severe that they made the plant uneconomical and constituted acts of indirect expropriation. “It was a total surprise for us,” the local Green party leader Jens Kerstan laughed, in a meeting at his sunny office in Hamburg last year. “As far as I knew, there were some [treaties] to protect German companies in the [developing] world or in dictatorships, but that a European company can sue Germany, that was totally a surprise to me.” Vattenfall v Germany ended in a settlement in 2011, after the company won its case in the local court and received a new water permit for its Moorburg plant – which significantly lowered the environmental standards that had originally been imposed, according to legal experts, allowing the plant to use more water from the river and weakening measures to protect fish. The European Commission has now stepped in, taking Germany to the EU Court of Justice, saying its authorisation of the Moorburg coal plant violated EU environmental law by not doing more to reduce the risk to protected fish species, including salmon, which pass near the plant while migrating from the North Sea. A year after the Moorburg case closed, Vattenfall filed another claim against Germany, this time over the federal government’s decision to phase out nuclear power. This second suit – for which very little information is available in the public domain, despite reports that the company is seeking €4.7bn from German taxpayers – is still ongoing. Roughly one third of all concluded cases filed at the ICSID are recorded as ending in “settlements”, which – as the Moorburg dispute shows – can be very profitable for investors, though their terms are rarely fully disclosed. There are now thousands of international investment agreements and free-trade acts, signed by states, which give foreign companies access to the investor-state dispute system, if they decide to challenge government decisions. Disputes are typically heard by panels of three arbitrators; one selected by each side, and the third agreed upon by both parties. Rulings are made by majority vote, and decisions are final and binding. There is no appeals process – only an annulment option that can be used on very limited grounds. If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world (the company can apply to local courts for an enforcement order). While a tribunal cannot force a country to change its laws, or give a company a permit, the risk of massive damages may in some cases be enough to persuade a government to reconsider its actions. The possibility of arbitration proceedings can be used to encourage states to enter into meaningful settlement negotiations. In Guatemala, internal government documents obtained through the country’s Freedom of Information Act show how the risk of one of these cases weighed heavily on one state’s decision not to challenge a controversial gold mine, despite protests from its citizens and a recommendation from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that it be closed down. Such an action, the documents warned, could provoke the company, owned by Canadian mining giant Goldcorp, to activate the ICSID or invoke clauses of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (Cafta) to gain “access to international arbitration and subsequent claims of damages to the state”. The mine was allowed to stay open. As the claims made by companies get bigger, it seems increasingly likely that the massive financial risks associated with investor-state arbitration will effectively grant foreign investors a veto over government decisions. * * * When companies are unsuccessful in their claims against states, there may be other advantages to be gained. In 2004, South Africa’s new, post-apartheid Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) came into force. Along with a new mining charter, the act sought to redress historical inequalities in the mining sector, in part by requiring companies to partner with citizens who had suffered under the apartheid regime. The new system terminated all previously held mining rights, and required companies to reapply for licences to continue their operations. It also instituted a mandatory 26% ownership stake in the country’s mining companies for black South Africans. Two years later, a group of Italian investors, who together control most of the South African granite industry, filed a landmark investor-state claim against South Africa. The country’s new mining regime, they argued, had unlawfully expropriated their investments and treated them unfairly. They demanded $350m in compensation. The case was filed by members of the Foresti and Conti families, prominent Tuscan industrialists, and a Luxembourg-based holding company, Finstone. They cited two bilateral investment treaties, both signed in the late 1990s, during Nelson Mandela’s presidency. Jason Brickhill, a lawyer at the Johannesburg-based Legal Resources Centre, said the new, post-apartheid government seemed to view these agreements “more as acts of diplomatic goodwill than serious legal commitments with potentially far-reaching economic consequences”. During that time, officials would be invited to meetings in Europe, he said, “and there would be all sorts of discussion about [South Africa’s] economic and trade direction, and part of that was an expectation that they would conclude an investment treaty – but they had no real understanding of what they were committing to in law”. Peter Draper, a former official in the South African Department of Trade and Industry, put it more starkly: “We were essentially giving away the store without asking any critical questions, or protecting crucial policy space.” The companies’ case against South Africa dragged on for four years, before ending abruptly when the Italian group dropped its claims and the tribunal ordered them to contribute €400,000 (£290,000) towards South Africa’s costs. At the time, a government press release celebrated it as “successful conclusion” – despite the fact that South Africa was still left with €5m in unreimbursed legal fees. But the investors claimed a more significant victory: the pressure of the case, they said, allowed them to strike an unprecedented deal with the South African government that allowed their companies to transfer only 5% of their ownership to black South Africans – rather than the 26% mandated by the state mining authority. “No other mining company in South Africa has been treated so generously since the advent of the [new mining regime],” one of the investors’ lawyers, Peter Leon, boasted at the time. The government seems to have agreed to this deal, which goes against the spirit of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa, to prevent a flood of other claims against it. “If the merits of the case were decided against the government, they thought, ‘That’s it, we are going to go down.’ And I think that’s why they were happy to agree to that settlement,” Jonathan Veeran, another of the company’s lawyers said, in an interview at his office in Johannesburg. His clients, he said, “were most pleased with the result”. * * * A small number of countries are now attempting to extricate themselves from the bonds of the investor-state dispute system. One of these is Bolivia, where thousands of people took to the streets of the country’s third-largest city, Cochabamba, in 2000, to protest against a dramatic hike in water rates by a private company owned by Bechtel, the US civil engineering firm. During the demonstrations, the Bolivian government stepped in and terminated the company’s concession. The company then filed a $50m suit against Bolivia at the ICSID. In 2006, following a campaign calling for the case to be thrown out, the company agreed to accept a token payment of less than $1. After this expensive case, Bolivia cancelled the international agreements it had signed with other states giving their investors access to these tribunals. But getting out of this system is not easily done. Most of these international agreements have sunset clauses, under which their provisions remain in force for a further 10 or even 20 years, even if the treaties themselves are cancelled. In 2010, Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, nationalised the country’s largest energy provider, Empresa Eléctrica Guaracachi. The UK power investor Rurelec, which indirectly held a 50.001% stake in the company, took Bolivia to the permanent court of arbitration in the Hague demanding $100m in compensation. Last year, Bolivia was ordered to pay Rurelec $35m; after months of further negotiations, the two sides settled on a payment of just over $31m in May 2014. Rurelec, which declined to comment for this article, celebrated the receipt of this award with a series of press releases on its website. “My only sadness is that it has taken so long to reach a settlement,” said the fund’s CEO in a statement. “All we wanted was a friendly negotiation and a handshake from President Morales.” Even states that first objected to the introduction of the investor-state dispute system at the 1964 World Bank meeting have since signed dozens of agreements expanding its reach. With the rapid growth in these treaties – today there are more than 3,000 in force – a specialist industry has developed in advising companies how best to exploit treaties that give investors access to the dispute resolution system, and how to structure their businesses to benefit from the different protections on offer. It is a lucrative sector: legal fees alone average $8m per case, but they have exceeded $30m in some disputes; arbitrators’ fees at start at $3,000 per day, plus expenses. While there is no equivalent of legal aid for states trying to defend themselves against these suits, corporations have access to a growing group of third-party financiers who are willing to fund their cases against states, usually in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. Increasingly, these suits are becoming valuable even before claims are settled. After Rurelec filed suit against Bolivia, it took its case to the market and secured a multimillion-dollar corporate loan, using its dispute with Bolivia as collateral, so that it could expand its business. Over the last 10 years, and particularly since the global financial crisis, a growing number of specialised investment funds have moved to raise money through these cases, treating companies’ multimillion-dollar claims against states as a new “asset class”. One of the largest of these funds to specialise in backing corporations’ suits against governments, Burford Capital, is based just a few blocks from East Croydon train station, on the fifth floor of a nondescript brown brick building. Companies rarely disclose when their cases are being financed by one of these third-party investors, but in the Rurelec suit against Bolivia, Burford issued a triumphant press release celebrating its “groundbreaking” involvement. Typically, funders like this will agree to back companies’ claims against states in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. In this case Burford gave Rurelec a $15m loan, using the claim against Bolivia as security. “Rurelec did not need capital to pay its lawyers. Rather, it needed capital to continue to grow its business,” Burford said in a statement. “This is a good demonstration that the benefits of litigation finance go far beyond that of simply helping to pay legal fees,” the CEO added, “and in many cases can provide an effective alternative method of financing to help companies achieve their strategic goals.” It was highly rewarding for Burford as well: it announced a net profit of $11m from the dispute. A spokesman for Burford explained further: “Burford did not fund Rurelec’s arbitration claim, which had been under way for two years before our involvement with the company. Rather, we provided a corporate debt facility to enable Rurelec to expand its South American operations, but we looked to the arbitration claim (a contingent asset) to assist in the repayment of the loan.” From the beginning, part of the justification for the international investor-state dispute system has been to create a “neutral forum” for conflicts to be resolved, with investors giving up the right to seek diplomatic support from their home countries when they file cases like this. But documents obtained in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that Rurelec was also able to rely on the British government, which actively intervened to support its case. The 44-page disclosure includes dozens of emails and internal briefing notes from May 2010 to June 2014, several of which explicitly reference British lobbying on behalf of the company. One email, to the UK ambassador to Bolivia, Ross Denny, whose sender has been redacted, includes the line “Lobby on Rurelec, yes.” Another, from Denny, said: “Our regular high-level lobbying on behalf of Rurelec has helped to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take protection of our companies’ interests.” Yet another said simply: “Rurelec needs our help.” It seems the British embassy was aware that the arbitration system is supposed to be impartial. One email, which appears to be about how to respond to an enquiry from a member of the public, said: “All things being equal, our line would be that HMG does not get involved in legal proceeding as brought under the investment treaties we have signed.” The message, whose sender and receivers are both redacted, continues: “If FCO [the Foreign and Commonwealth Office] has had an ongoing dialogue with the company on this topic, it would probably be more appropriate for you to respond with some general lines from us on the benefits of investment treaties.” * * * El Salvador has already spent more than $12m defending itself against Pacific Rim, but even if it succeeds in beating the company’s $284m claim, it may never recover these costs. For years Salvadoran protest groups have been calling on the World Bank to initiate an open and public review of ICSID. To date, no such study has been carried out. In recent years, a number of ideas have been mooted to reform the international investor-state dispute system – to adopt a “loser pays” approach to costs, for example, or to increase transparency. The solution may lie in creating an appeals system, so that controversial judgments can be revisited. Last year, David Morales, El Salvador’s human rights ombudsman (a state post created as part of the peace process after the country’s civil war, fought between 1979 and 1992) took out a full-page ad in the national newspaper La Prensa Gráfica calling on the government to review all of the international investment treaties it has signed, with a view to renegotiating or cancelling them. Luis Parada, representing El Salvador in its dispute with Pacific Rim, agrees that this would be a wise move: “I personally don’t think countries get as much from these treaties than the risks that they incur in international arbitration.” Other countries have already decided to cut their losses, and tried to get out of these trade treaties. Shortly after settling the lawsuit with foreign mining companies over its new post-apartheid mining rules, South Africa began to terminate many of its own investment agreements. “What was concerning for us was that you could have an international arbitration – three individuals, making a decision – on what was in effect a legislative programme in South Africa that had been arrived at democratically, and that somehow this arbitration panel could potentially call this into question,” said Xavier Carim, a former deputy director-general in South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry. “It was very, very clear that these treaties are open to such wide interpretations by panels, or by investors looking to challenge any government measure, with the possibility of a significant payout at the end of the day,” said Carim, who is now South Africa’s representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. “The simple fact is that these treaties give you very little benefit and they just pose risk.” Before moving to terminate its agreements, the South African government commissioned an internal study to help determine whether such treaties actually did help boost foreign investment. “There was no pattern between signing treaties and getting investment,” Carim explained. “We’ve had huge investments from the US and Japan and India and a number of other countries where we don’t have investment treaties. Companies don’t come and invest in a country or not because it does or doesn’t have a bilateral investment treaty. They invest if there is a return to be made.” Brazil has never signed up to this system – it has not entered into a single treaty with these investor-state dispute provisions – and yet it has had no trouble attracting foreign investment. Parada said it would take “a broad consensus of determined states” in order to truly rein in this system. “The states that created the system are the only ones that can fix it,” he said. “I have not seen a critical mass of states with the political will [to do this] … much less a broad consensus. But I still hope it happens.” • Claire Provost and Matt Kennard are Bertha fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism.

Anything greater than a one in 10,000 chance per year was regarded as unacceptable. Since the tsunami in Japan in March there has been debate in archaeological circles about the odds of such an event happening in Britain. UK tsunamis were always recorded as weather related \"floods\" but Simon Parfitt, from the National History Museum in London, reports three tsunamis in the past 10,000 years. One devastated the east coast of Scotland 8,000 years ago, a second in 1607 was in the Bristol Channel (with waves 7.5 metres high travelling at 31 miles an hour) and a third in 1755 hit Britain's south-west coast. The 1607 event, which was caused by a small earthquake and landslip off southern Ireland, would have swamped the sites of both Hinkley Point and Oldbury nuclear power stations. But archaeologists are just as exercised by the dangers to the two Dungeness power stations \"with evidence of a succession of major flooding events in the recent past\". These reactors are already only kept from the sea by a fleet of lorries continuously moving shingle to replace 6 metres of coast lost each year through erosion. With more severe storms forecast, and sea level rise in this area now expected to be more than a metre this century, the scientists are wondering about the suitability of this spot for more nuclear stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/jul/18/fukushima-steam-reactor-radiation-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-18T09:46:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima rainfall caused steam above reactor, says Tepco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/fukushima-steam-reactor-radiation-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jul/18/fukushima-steam-reactor-radiation-levels","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima rainfall caused steam above reactor, says Tepco","bodyText":"The operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant said on Thursday that radiation levels were stable after vapour was detected coming from one of the three reactors that went into meltdown after the triple disaster in Japan in March 2011. Video images showed the vapour, which is thought to be steam, rising from the damaged building housing reactor No 3. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), reeling from recent criticism of its handling of contaminated water at the plant, said the reactor's spent fuel pool was stable, adding that there had been no significant rises in radiation levels in the vicinity. A worker monitoring live camera images noticed that what appeared to be steam was hovering just above the primary containment vessel at 8.20am on Thursday. The vapour was still visible two hours later, reports said. Tepco said rainfall on Wednesday night could have been the cause. \"We think it's possible that rain made its way through the reactor building and having fallen on the primary containment vessel, which is hot, evaporated and created steam,\" said Mayumi Yoshida, a Tepco spokeswoman. The reactor is one of three at Fukushima Daiichi that went into meltdown after a tsunami knocked out the plant's regular and emergency power supplies on the afternoon of 11 March 2011. The building that houses reactor No 3 was also badly damaged by a hydrogen explosion in the aftermath of the tsunami. Radiation levels near the top of the building are still too high for workers to enter. Instead, they are using remote-controlled machinery to remove rubble and tsunami debris. Fuel inside the damaged reactors melted and is believed to be resting at the bottom of their primary containment vessels, where it is being cooled by huge quantities of water fed through a network of pipes and hoses. Tepco has admitted it is struggling to create enough storage space at the site for contaminated water. In April, the firm requested permission to channel water containing comparatively low levels of radiation into the sea, but the move was opposed by local fishermen. The vapour release comes soon after Japan's new nuclear regulation authority said it suspected that radioactive water used to cool the reactors was leaking into the Pacific ocean from underground. Last week, workers discovered there had been a dramatic increase in levels of caesium and other radioactive substances in groundwater about 25 metres from the sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/dec/04/eurostar-stake-for-sale-government-assets-privatisation","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-04T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"Eurostar stake up for grabs in £10bn sell-off of government assets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/04/eurostar-stake-for-sale-government-assets-privatisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/dec/04/eurostar-stake-for-sale-government-assets-privatisation","fields":{"headline":"Eurostar stake up for grabs in £10bn sell-off of government assets","bodyText":"Britain's stake in the cross-channel rail operator Eurostar will be sold off under a new £10bn privatisation programme. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will announce on Wednesday that he has doubled the coalition's target for the disposal of state assets to £20bn over the next six years, just weeks after the government was criticised for undervaluing Royal Mail during its controversial flotation. The disposal of the UK's 40% stake in Eurostar could potentially net the Treasury hundreds of millions of pounds. The higher target for privatisations will lead to speculation about which other businesses in the government's estimated £600bn corporate and property portfolio will be sold in the coming years. Assets held by the state include the broadcaster Channel 4, and support services businesses such as Companies House, the Royal Mint, the Met Office and Ordnance Survey, as well as the Post Office. In the past, coalition ministers have maintained that the Eurostar stake would be retained. The company, which is majority-owned by the French state rail firm, SNCF, more than doubled profits to £52m last year. The surprise announcement comes weeks after ministers were criticised for allowing Eurostar to bid for the state-owned East Coast mainline over concerns it would create a conflict of interest. The sell-off also comes at a time of debate about private versus public ownership of the railways, amid concern about soaring fares and poor performance by many franchises. Labour is opposing the sale of the East Coast mainline and has indicated it would allow publicly owned companies to operate railways on the same terms as private companies. Ministers are already trying to sell a series of taxpayer-owned assets to help pay down the UK's debts, including a £3bn stake in the nuclear firm Urenco. The coalition recently sold the blood company Plasma UK for £200m and part of the student loan book to a consortium of investment funds for £160m. Further privatisations could be fiercely opposed by the unions, which have threatened strike action over the Royal Mail sell-off. The latest privatisation round will be detailed as part of an updated national infrastructure plan set out by Alexander in a speech at the Institution of Civil Engineers, in which he will say the value of planned projects in Britain has now risen by 20% to £375bn, with more than a quarter to be provided with public money and the rest from the private sector. Alexander will announce: • Billions of pounds of public money will be used to back the new Wylfa nuclear power station, due to be built by Japanese investors Hitachi on the Welsh island of Anglesey. The Treasury has signed an agreement that it will guarantee loans to the project in future – enabling Hitachi to get cheap finance – in a deal similar to the one offered to France's EDF to build a nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, Somerset. • Large insurance companies have put aside £25bn for spending on national infrastructure over the next five years, following changes in European rules pushed for by the UK that incentivise investment in a wider range of assets. • Plans to bring in the UK's first toll road for a decade have been scrapped. Improvements to the A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon will be financed by the government and not by the motorists using the road, after a public outcry and David Cameron's acknowledgment of \"strong feelings\" about it in East Anglia. • Terms have been agreed on a £1bn guarantee for the London Underground's Northern line extension to Battersea. • An extra £50m will be allocated to redevelop the railway station at Gatwick Airport. Describing the £25bn investment by insurers as a \"massive vote of confidence\", Alexander will say Britain's infrastructure is being rebuilt after years of neglect. \"It supports the wider £100bn public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the spending round 2013. Underground, overground, on shore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we're building it right now,\" he will say. The response from the CBI business group was tentative, with Katja Hall, its chief policy director, saying \"the devil will be in the detail on timelines and delivery\". Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary, accused the government of \"complete failure\" over infrastructure, as official statistics show work on projects is down 3.7% in the past year and fell by 10% in 2012. \"Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground.\" On Tuesday night, the Treasury said 99% of the government's 27 priority road, rail and flood projects are on target. Two have been completed so far.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney is cutting short a trip to Australia, where G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are gathering, to ensure he is in the UK in case the contingency plan he has drawn up needs to be implemented. The Treasury insists Chancellor George Osborne – who is not going to Cairns – has no contingency plan. Christopher Wheeler, analyst at Mediobanca, reckons if there is a yes vote the Bank of England will say: \"Nothing's changed. We're in a period of negotiation, over which time we will make sure there's an orderly transition to the independent Scotland.\" Bank deposits of up to £85,000 per institution would be still guaranteed by the British government. However, five banks registered in Scotland – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Clydesdale, Tesco Bank and TSB – have said they plan to move their registrations to London in the event of a yes vote. This has caused controversy about jobs and the impact on the Scottish economy, though cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said last week it would maintain financial stability. Scotland's banks currently have assets 12 times the size of Scotland's GDP while Scottish Financial Enterprise, which represents Scotland's financial industry, estimates the sector generates between £7bn and £9bn and directly employs around 100,000 people. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said the Bank of England would need to clarify which currency an independent Scotland would use: Westminster has ruled out Scotland adopting the pound officially but first minister Alex Salmond could use the currency anyway. There are 18 months for those issues to be ironed out, but financial markets will be poised to give their verdict on the outcome at exactly 8am on Friday – provided that bad weather doesn't prevent all ballots being counted on Thursday night. Jill Treanor OIL Whether their money is safe may be the first question in many minds on Friday morning, but looking further out, the black gold in the North Sea is what will bankroll any self-standing Scottish economy for decades to come. Big oil companies BP and Shell have made it clear they do not want separation, but it is Aberdeen-based Sir Ian Wood, founder of the global offshore supply group that bears his name, who has led the verbal charge against Alex Salmond. Key to the debate so far has been the amount of reserves left to be developed. The Scottish Nationalist party has talked of 24bn barrels of reserves (oil and gas), with a potential value of £1.5 trillion over 40 years. Their assessments have been based on work by Professor Alex Kemp, a respected petroleum expert from Aberdeen University, but have been repeatedly challenged. Wood believes the more realistic figure is between 15bn and 16.5bn barrels and last week Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden endorsed this lower calculation. BP, meanwhile, used the figure of 3bn barrels of \"proven\" reserves in its latest annual Statistical Review of World Energy, something of a bible in the industry. Part of the reason there can be endless debate round this issue is that there are a range of factors – some of them outside the control of national governments – that can dictate extraction rates. One is the price of oil on world markets. It is currently just under $100 per barrel (£61) – the price used in the SNP's calculations – but has been lower than $10 as recently as 1998 and briefly hit $148 in 2008. The North Sea is considered a \"mature\" area, with few big new pockets of oil likely to be found, and the highly mobile oil companies are more interested in places such as Angola, Brazil and even the Gulf of Mexico. Around £13bn is being invested this year into various offshore fields but this level of spending is expected to drop off sharply after 2015. Meanwhile, there is a very low level of new exploration drilling going on today, while production is falling very fast. Big Oil only goes where the geology and the tax rates are highly attractive and it is currently pressing London for more fiscal incentives. An independent Scottish government would come under immense pressure to keep the industry happy – and Salmond could not afford to say no. Terry Macalister ENERGY If the debate around North Sea oil and gas has been heated, there has been next to no public discussion about the wider power and electricity markets. Energy policy, subsidies and many operations are currently directed from London, but many nuclear power stations, windfarms and innovative wave and tidal power projects are located north of the border. A policy white paper issued by the Scottish government stressed that Edinburgh and London would both want to continue with a unified energy system to guarantee security of supply. But politicians down south have scoffed at the notion that they could impose on English and Welsh householders the cost of subsidising the development of another country's energy infrastructure. An estimated £560m worth of public subsidies – 28% of the UK total – are currently ploughed into Scottish green power systems via the renewables obligation from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. A planned cross-border arrangement proposed in 2012 between the UK and Ireland has already foundered on disagreements over subsidies, although Nordic countries have been able to cooperate successfully on power. Meanwhile, the UK has been happy to use French electricity through the interconnector, and gets gas from Norway, Qatar and even Russia. The energy department has claimed that independence would cost Scottish households an additional £189 to pay for the renewables obligation, upgrading the system and other costs. At the moment much of the power produced in Scotland is transported south, but what would happen if Westminster cut up rough after an independence vote and refused to accept it, or demanded lower prices? Equally, Scotland, where new nuclear is currently ruled out, is dependent during times of low wind on power transported north from England, which in theory could also be withheld. There are also questions over the seabed – and hence tidal and wave power. The Crown Estate currently manages this part of the coastline on a unified basis and has invested £100m to speed up the delivery of renewable power, but the SNP administration has already stated that it would expect to take control of its own seabed come independence. Scotland is home to Scottish Power (now owned by the Spanish) and SSE, based in Perth, which argues for some stability, but independent energy consultancy Cornwall Energy says there is \"immense uncertainty\" about the ramifications of a yes vote on the energy sector's regulatory framework. Terry Macalister RETAIL Retailers have warned that the costs associated with trading in another currency and the extra bureaucracy could mean Scots end up paying dearly for independence – with higher prices in the shops and less investment in new stores. Last week some of the high street's biggest names, including Asda, B&amp;Q, John Lewis and Waitrose, voiced concerns about how a yes vote would affect the costs of running shops in Scotland should the independent country rethink key issues such as regulation, pensions and taxation. \"Currently our systems are set up for one single UK market, we use the same currency and we operate under the same rates of VAT,\" said Asda boss Andy Clarke. \"If we were no longer to operate in one state with one market and – broadly – one set of rules, our business model would inevitably become more complex.\" He warned that this could translate into higher prices. The changes, he warned, could lead to higher running costs for the business and prices would have to be adjusted to cover them. Retailers say profit margins are lower in Scotland due to high distribution costs and tough rules on the sale of tobacco and alcohol, but the impact is absorbed into UK-wide operations. Analysts point, for example, to standard internet delivery charges and question whether prices would rise to reflect the cost of reaching remote locations if Scotland was a separate market. But the biggest unknown for retailers is the currency question. \"The currency issue will cascade right through a business depending on where its head office and shareholders are,\" said Angus Armstrong, director of macroeconomic research at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank. He believes the possibility of switching to a new currency would necessitate government austerity measures, which in turn could affect the business case for retailers planning new stores in Scotland. The uncertainty could trigger an investment hiatus that \"could last a number of years until currency arrangements have bedded down\", he said. Zoe Wood FOOD AND DRINK From single malt to smoked salmon and Tunnock's teacakes, as featured dancing at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in June, Scotland's food and drink industry is big business. Employing 330,000 people, it is Scotland's largest manufacturing industry, worth £9.2bn, and takes in the £3.2bn fish and farming sector. And as the world increasingly gets a taste for Scotch and shortbread, the industry is expecting further growth. A recent survey of 100 firms found that two thirds were planning to take on more staff in the next five years, which could mean an additional 10,000 jobs if replicated across the industry. The Scottish government has said it will give food and drink producers more support to sell their wares abroad, and they would continue to benefit from the use of the pound and from European Union membership. But as doubts grow about the likelihood of a currency union with the UK or uninterrupted EU membership, some industry figures told academics at Edinburgh University they were concerned about the currency question and taxes, as well as constraints on trade with the rest of the UK. None expected any boost to the Scottish brand from independence. The Scotch Whisky Association has warned that even a temporary interruption of EU membership \"would be damaging and difficult\", and has raised concerns about the loss of UK embassies and consulates. Scotch whisky is exported to 200 countries, but the Scottish government has plans to maintain only 70 to 90 overseas missions. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation has said the industry is \"nervous\" about coming off second best in contests with the rest of the UK over fishing rights in the event of a split, as well as losing clout in the EU. Jennifer Rankin TRANSPORT Assuming Scotland will not emulate those former British colonies that symbolically switched to driving on the right after independence, there should be few stark changes in transport. Roads are already under devolved control; driving licences would not change. In rail, franchising and fare-setting powers likewise sit with the Scottish parliament, which has already pledged to slowly bring down ticket prices. Bids for the next Scotrail franchise term are in and a private firm will run trains until at least 2025, shelving any renationalisation debate for now. But Network Rail's recent reclassification as a state body has added a new layer of complication after independence, meaning Scotland would probably have to create a new track operator. The yes campaign has noted Scots would be spared their share of the bill for HS2 – which, despite slightly cutting journey times from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London, is on balance likely to leave Scots relatively worse off, according to consultants KPMG. Two of the big four UK transport operators, FirstGroup and Stagecoach, are based in Scotland; the latter's chairman, Brian Souter, is a major SNP backer. City analysts predict any change of regime would be neutral for their prospects, noting that any potential lowering of tax rates for businesses would probably be offset by a commitment to public transport. Government warnings that a £1,000 annual levy on foreign hauliers using UK roads could apply to Scottish firms have been dismissed as a scare by yes campaigners. One likely development would be a substantial cut to air passenger duty, following the example of Northern Ireland, or even its abolition – leading British Airways' boss, Willie Walsh, to say independence would be a \"positive development\". A cut would make Scottish flights more affordable and should boost routes between Scotland and southern England, as well as potentially attracting some business north to take long-haul flights.

In a Today programme interview the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, explained that Canadian and Australian pension funds were here to help with worthy social projects such as extending the runway at Birmingham airport. In the Treasury's spin this was a win-win story because \"after years of neglect our infrastructure … needs renewal\". This kind of announcement is part of news-flow management and it will be lost in today's headlines when the chancellor himself gives his autumn statement. Today's bad news is that higher GDP growth won't save us from more austerity and working longer for our pensions (with tax cuts postponed). But it is worth pausing a while to deconstruct yesterday's news because there's a backstory here about failed assumptions and broken promises, which helps to explain the mess we're in. Privatisation was about a promise of investment. Whenever state assets were sold off, the promise was that the newly privatised firm would tap the capital markets to bring in investment which the cash-strapped state could not provide. This is how Vince Cable and the government argued Royal Mail privatisation was necessary and beneficial. The rationale was much the same in the 1980s floats of BT and British Gas or the 1990s privatisation that broke up British Rail. The promise of private capital expenditure was not delivered, except in water. That was a special case because new regulations made investment in clean up mandatory and the regulator allowed the companies to charge the consumer and put the cost on the bill. Elsewhere, the private operators were investment- and risk-averse corporates under pressure to deliver shareholder value: their business model was not to bring in investment that would lower return on capital but to extract distributable cash from the legacy infrastructure that they had inherited from the state. The sound you hear in the background after privatisation is the giant sucking sound of value being extracted by pipe and cable utilities who have failed to renew our infrastructure. The results are most obvious in telecoms. BT is bidding for sporting rights against Sky, yet not investing in the replacement of old copper wire, so we have the compromise of fibre-optic cables running only to street cabinets in towns, not to people's homes, and no working plan for delivering rural broadband. Currently, rail is the only utility where large-scale new investment is going in and that is because not-for-profit Network Rail can issue state-guaranteed private bonds. So, privatisation has brought us unsustainability and growing problems about national security. Second-rate broadband provision is bad for competitiveness and worsening problems in energy supply have worrying national security implications. We are ill prepared for cold weather when we have a fortnight's back-up gas storage, and, in electricity, there are questions about whether the clapped-out generating system can keep the lights on. That is why a desperate government is bribing the French firm EDF to construct a new nuclear power station at Hinkley with extravagant guaranteed electricity prices. More broadly, the infrastructure plan shows that the government has learned nothing about how Thatcher-style privatisation does not work in capital intensive utilities. The infrastructure plan includes more of the same with the sale of 40% of Eurostar, a student loan book and bits of this and that. But selling assets will not get the government out of its current fix on infrastructure investment. The furore about energy prices shows consumers won't pay and the government can't pay, so where is the investment going to come from? The infrastructure plan shows that the answer is to bring in a second set of private-sector players (mainly pension funds and insurance companies) who will now provide the fixed capital investment. But this comes at a price, because the funds will add a second set of financial claims on the revenue stream coming from household consumers of utility services, whose bills will effectively include one charge for operator dividends and a second charge for interest on fixed capital investment. Maybe it wouldn't be too bad if the pension funds and insurance companies were British, because then what comes around goes around. Inside our national economy, the double extraction would be a transfer from all households that consume utilities towards the minority of retired households. But in the government's £375bn investment plan only £25bn will come from six British insurance companies. So it is retired Ontario and Melbourne teachers who will benefit. We need an alternative plan for infrastructure that recognises some basic realities. First, regulate privatised operators on the assumption that they are both extractive and investment averse so their margins should be modest unless they can prove they are taking risk. Second, rearrange domestic financial flows so that British pension funds can invest directly in infrastructure including social housing. Most British pension funds are earning no more than 5% from paper investments, why not get that from building something useful?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/jan/05/greenland-mines-arctic-fears-pristine-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-05T17:09:08Z","webTitle":"Greenland explores Arctic mineral riches amid fears for pristine region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/05/greenland-mines-arctic-fears-pristine-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/05/greenland-mines-arctic-fears-pristine-environment","fields":{"headline":"Greenland explores Arctic mineral riches amid fears for pristine region","bodyText":"London Mining, a British mineral company, is trying to attract Chinese and other international investors to build a £1.5bn iron ore mine just outside the Arctic Circle in Greenland. The move comes as BP and Shell join others exploring for oil and gas in the pristine waters off Greenland, as concerns grow that the wave of industrialisation in the region will damage the pristine environment. Greenland and the wider Arctic is seen as one of the new frontiers for exploiting mineral wealth, but uncertain national boundaries have also opened up potential political, if not military, conflicts. London Mining, whose board includes a former British foreign minister in Sir Nicholas Bonsor, has already opened talks with Chinese mining group Sichuan Xinye and others about helping finance a new mine at Isua. London Mining chief executive Graeme Hossie said the company was looking at \"all options, including Danish, other Nordic, Chinese and other global investors.\" He said the competition for funding was challenging and it was hard to predict when it would be in place. The project has received government approval and could result in an influx of more than 3,000 construction workers into the country, which has a population of 57,000, to build a port and pipeline to serve the mine. At present there is no mining of any kind in Greenland, but the cash-strapped and semi-autonomous country is keen to break away from financial and political dependence on its historical owner, Denmark. In October a new government in Nuuk led by prime minister Aleqa Hammond gave the go-ahead to the Isua scheme and another at Kvanefjeld, while lifting a decades-long ban on mining uranium and rare-earth minerals. Parliament voted to end the ban by 15 votes to 14 amid concern about the environmental and social impact of large mining schemes – particularly those involving radioactive materials such as uranium. Hossie said: \"London Mining has carried out several years of comprehensive environmental studies, all showing that the project can be completed without damaging the environment.\" However, a social impact report prepared by London Mining, which is backed by some of Britain's biggest pension schemes such as Standard Life and F&amp;C Asset Management, accepted there would be some detrimental effects from its scheme: \"The key risks and negative impacts are on a more social and health level such as social conflicts, vulnerable groups, risk for accidents and access to natural areas during the construction phase. Furthermore, there will be a pressure on the development plans and public service.\" Last March the government of Kuupik Kleist fell after an election campaign dominated by an acrimonious debate over whether industries such as mining and oil would damage the traditional Inuit trades of fishing and hunting. In particular there was criticism that the Isua scheme could lead to thousands of Chinese arriving in Greenland with a wider agenda of controlling an area of vast potential mineral wealth to feed their own country's industrialisation. London Mining has been keen to dampen this speculation and the new government has insisted all staffing plans will be discussed with local trade unions. The Kvanefjeld scheme has been proposed by Australian company Greenland Minerals and Energy to produce uranium for a new generation of nuclear power stations in China and elsewhere. It is also intends to mine rare-earth minerals used in hi-tech weaponry and mobile phones. Meanwhile, oil firms including BP, Shell, Statoil and ConocoPhillips have been awarded licences to operate in the region to join those previously given to ExxonMobil and Cairn Energy. Offshore drilling by Cairn in summer 2011 put it into physical contact with environmental campaigners from Greenpeace who want drilling to stop. The 30 protesters from Greenpeace who were jailed in Russia and released before Christmas had been arrested for trying to disrupt similar operations in the Barents Sea. But wider concerns surround the uncertain national boundaries with Canada and Russia, which are among the countries pressing territorial claims through a process handled under the UN convention on the law of the sea. When Canada announced last month it intended to lay claim to the north pole – never before taken as national territory – the move caused alarm among the other Arctic states: Denmark, Russia, Norway and the US. Russian president Vladimir Putin quickly promised to increase Russia's military presence in the region in response to Canada's claim, which would extend its territory by half a million square miles. Canada itself and Norway also plan to increase defence spending in the far north. The Arctic nations are increasingly looking to the north as a source of natural resources and shipping lanes. The US Geological Survey has estimated the region has 30% of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 15% of the oil. In 2012 Lloyd's of London warned of the environmental dangers of more than £60bn of investment heading to the Arctic over the next decade. To request an extension of their nautical borders countries must submit proposals to the UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf. Under international law the five countries with territories near the Arctic Circle are allotted 200 nautical miles from their northern coasts. Under the UN convention on the law of the sea, exclusive claims can be vastly expanded for Arctic nations that prove that their part of the continental shelf extends beyond that zone – as Canada intends to do with a claim to the Lomonosov Ridge, an undersea mountain range between Ellesmere Island, Canada's most northern land mass, and Russia's east Siberian coast. That would extend Canada's claim 200 nautical miles beyond the north pole."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/23/grangemouth-oil-shock","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-23T21:55:21Z","webTitle":"Grangemouth: oil shock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/23/grangemouth-oil-shock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/23/grangemouth-oil-shock","fields":{"headline":"Grangemouth: oil shock","bodyText":"The buckle in Scotland's industrial belt, Grangemouth is said to represent 2% of the nation's GDP and 8% of its manufacturing industry. The closure of the petrochemical works is an immediate catastrophe for 800 workers who are, in all likelihood, looking at Christmas on the dole. It may soon be a disaster, too, for the 500-plus workers at the neighbouring refinery, which has until now survived in symbiosis with the chemical plant, not to mention businesses in the town and neighbouring Polmont, which – after the disappearance of so many pay cheques averaging over £50,000 – will find custom mightily hard to come by. Beyond this shattering blow to the immediate community, however, Wednesday's news seriously bruises Holyrood's hopes of a viably independent Scottish economy, and Westminster's pretensions of having any real strategy for energy at all. Having made the courageous decision to put himself front-and-centre of efforts to salvage the plant, through the bitter industrial relations dispute which came before the sudden announcement of closure, Alex Salmond now needs to demonstrate that all his words about finding an alternative owner are more than just talk. He may be tempted to do what he has so often done and blame the dead hand of Whitehall – implying that if only Scotland were free, all would be well. The old trick will not work this time, because what the announcement starkly exposes is not the particular failings of London or Edinburgh, but rather the sheer hollowness – in all parts of these islands – of all of the post-credit-crunch talk about bold new industrial policies. The decisions that did for Grangemouth came from Swiss-registered Ineos, and its boss, Jim Ratcliffe, who has reportedly been steering events from a yacht on the Côte d'Azur. The dwindling ethane component of North Sea oil, a strident union's preoccupation with one of Scotland's last final-salary pension schemes and global energy markets all played their role. As did the company's insistence on pursuing the Unite convener in connection with the Labour party vote-rigging scandal in nearby Falkirk, even after the police had concluded that there was nothing to prosecute and the party that there was no one to discipline. So there were pressures from many directions. But when Mr Ratcliffe decided to answer a 48-hour strike threat with a lockout, government influence of any sort was conspicuous by its absence. Conceivably things could still change, but as he spoke of feeling \"saddened\" , energy secretary Ed Davey did not sound like he was about to change the game. Mr Salmond talked tougher, but it remains to be seen what he can actually do to try to lure in alternative investors. Seeing as the refinery is nearly half-owned by PetroChina, it could just be that – exactly as with nuclear power at the start of the week – the decisions that matter for Grangemouth now could be made in Beijing. If Grangemouth goes, reliance on imported gas will be compounded by dependence on foreign-processed fuel for motoring. In the US, concern about \"energy independence\" is part of the mainstream discourse. Britain is likewise crying out for an energy strategy, but there is no room for that within the market-led thinking that has dominated the field since electricity privatisation almost a quarter of a century ago. Out of ideas, and panicked by John Major's injunction to Do Something, David Cameron had nothing to offer on heating bills, aside from dismantling the sort of green pricing which he once favoured. It is telling that Ed Miliband has now made the political weather for weeks on end, with an off-the-cuff promise to freeze fuel bills for a matter of months. Turning guns on unpopular corporate villains is all well and good, but Labour, too, has many years of non-thinking to make up for before it can lay claim to anything that looks vaguely like a serious energy plan. The luckless employees of Grangemouth have suffered from the absence of that, and increasingly Britain as a whole will pay a price, too. • This article was amended on 24 October 2013.

In his combative preface to the report, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a medical doctor and professor emeritus at Tokyo University, said the crisis was the result of \"a multitude of errors and willful negligence\", by the government, safety officials and the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco]. But behind the safety missteps and lack of readiness for a tsunami in a region known for powerful earthquakes, are cultural traits that ensured the disaster was \"made in Japan\", Kurokawa said. \"Its fundamental causes,\" he wrote, \"are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the programme'; our groupism; and our insularity. \"What must be admitted – very painfully – is that this was a disaster 'Made in Japan'. \"Had other Japanese been in the shoes of those who bear responsibility for this accident, the result may well have been the same.\" None of the agencies involved emerged with any credit. \"The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,\" said the report, compiled by the Fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission. \"They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly 'man-made'.\" The panel's report, one of three major investigations into the accident, challenged claims by Tepco that the triple meltdown at the plant in north-east Japan had been caused solely by a 14-metre tsunami on 11 March last year. The panel said the magnitude-9 earthquake that preceded the waves could not be ruled out as a cause of the accident. It accused Tepco and regulators at the nuclear and industrial safety agency of failing to take adequate safety measures, despite evidence that the area was susceptible to powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. \"We believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual,\" it said. \"Across the board, the commission found ignorance and arrogance unforgivable for anyone or any organisation that deals with nuclear power. We found a disregard for global trends and a disregard for public safety.\" The 641-page report was published on the same day a nuclear reactor in western Japan became the first to produce electricity since the accident. All of the country's 50 functioning reactors had been switched off after the crisis to undergo safety checks. Japan, which once depended on nuclear power for about a third of its energy supply, was briefly without atomic power for the first time in more than 40 years after the last reactor went offline in early May. The No 3 reactor at Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture is the first to be restarted after passing stress tests that the government introduced last year to ease public concerns over safety. The government approved the restart of reactors 3 and 4 at Oi amid warnings that without them a large area of western Japan, including the industrial city of Osaka, could face power shortages this summer. The No 3 reactor should reach full capacity by 10 July, the plant's operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), said, while the second unit will begin producing electricity towards the end of the month. The last of the plant's 11 reactors were switched off in February. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the prime minister's office every Friday evening to protest against the restart, while polls show a majority of Japanese want the government to phase out nuclear power. \"We have made a step toward the safe and stable supply of electricity by being able to deliver nuclear-generated electricity for the first time in four and a half months,\" Kepco's president, Makoto Yagi, said in a statement. While not unexpected, the critical tone of Thursday's report contrasts with a similar investigation by Tepco in which the utility insisted it had acted appropriately in the wake of a natural disaster it claimed it could never have predicted. Tepco has always maintained that the damage to four of Fukushima Daiichi's reactors was caused by the tsunami, which knocked out cooling apparatus and prompted a core meltdown in three of the units. More than 15 months later, the plant has been brought to a safe state known as \"cold shutdown,\" although concerns have been voiced about the state of a pool containing spent fuel rods in reactor No 4. Thursday's report called for an investigation into the role the earthquake played in the accident. \"As for direct cause of the accident, the commission reached the conclusion that we cannot definitely say any devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the earthquake,\" it said. \"We cannot rule out the possibility that a small-scale LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) occurred at the reactor No 1 in particular.\" The panel was also critical of Naoto Kan, the prime minister at the time of the accident, whose \"direct intervention\" in the early days of the crisis had caused confusion in the chain of command and wasted valuable time. Kan said he decided to intervene in the emergency response because Tepco and safety officials appeared incapable of doing so. The parliamentary panel said there was no evidence, however, to support Kan's claim that Tepco was preparing to withdraw all of its workers from the plant in the immediate aftermath of the accident. But it accused Tepco of ignoring warnings going as far back as 2006 that a tsunami could cause a blackout at the plant. The firm, regulators and the government had \"failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release\", it said. \"Since 2006, the regulators and Tepco were aware of the risk that a total outage of electricity at the Fukushima Daiichi plant might occur if a tsunami were to reach the level of the site.\" The 10-member commission is one of several panels investigating the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The report follows a six-month investigation involving more than 900 hours of hearings and interviews with more than 1,100 people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-28T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"British plan to avert climate disaster using sun power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/29/sunpower-programme-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"British plan to avert climate disaster using sun power","bodyText":"Two of Britain's leading scientists have urged the setting up of a world Sunpower Programme to deliver solar electricity that is cheaper than fossil fuel power by 2025. All countries should be invited to participate, says Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, and the economist Lord Richard Layard in an article in the Observer. The programme's target would be the development of techniques that see solar electricity generate at least 10% of the world's total energy supply by 2025, and 25% by 2030. King and Layard's proposal has been put forward in the wake of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on the likely impact of climate change, triggered by rising carbon emissions. The world desperately needs to wean itself off its fossil fuel habits and find fresh, renewable methods for generating electricity. Nuclear power and wind energy have potential but face political problems. By contrast, solar energy holds vast promise, they say. \"The sun sends energy to the earth equal to about 5,000 times our total energy needs. It is inconceivable that we cannot collect enough of this energy for our needs, at a reasonable cost.\" They acknowledge that a number of scientific breakthroughs will be needed to make cheap solar energy a global prospect. In particular, scientists will have to find ways to reduce the cost of transmitting electricity from areas of high luminosity and low land value to the major population centres of the world. This will require new materials that are much better at conducting electricity, without loss of power, than present methods. This would be a major aim of the new solar energy programme. The proposal to set up the Sunpower Programme comes as campaigners, politicians and business leaders have called for \"immediate action\" on climate change after the starkest warning yet that manmade global warming is leading to catastrophic and irreversible consequences. Leading scientists at the IPCC meeting in Stockholm last week said they were \"95% certain\" that climate change was occurring and caused by human actions. IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri said: \"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.\" Connie Hedegaard, the EU's commissioner for climate action, said: \"What would you do if your doctor was 95% sure you had a serious illness? Whose side are you on? Those who want to act on 95% certainty or those who gamble on the remaining 5%?\" The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, invited world leaders to a summit next year to formulate a plan. \"We must act now,\" he urged. The IPCC reported that the world was on course for a rise in temperatures of more than 2C by the end of the century, causing heatwaves, droughts, sea level rises and extreme rainfall. Nations have set their own targets for curbing greenhouse gases but experts say these are inadequate to meet the reductions required. Samantha Smith of the World Wildlife Fund said: \"We must act or face frightening new impacts. We know that most of the pollution that causes climate change comes from burning fossil fuels. WWF calls on governments and investors to stop investing in dirty energy and start an immediate and just transition by investing in renewables.\" Mindy Lubber, who heads a US coalition of financial investors committed to tackling climate change, said: \"The IPCC's conclusion is unequivocal – climate change is happening\" Nick Robins, head of HSBC's climate change centre of excellence, warned: \"We are putting the weather on steroids. We know that temperatures continue to warm and that impacts are fully in line with what we would expect from a warming world, including rising sea levels and melting glaciers. And this is affecting economies today. Our research shows that India, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil are the G20 nations that are most vulnerable to climate risks.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/apr/06/odds-against-nation-of-walkers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-05T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Why is Britain such a dangerous place for walkers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/06/odds-against-nation-of-walkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/06/odds-against-nation-of-walkers","fields":{"headline":"Why is Britain such a dangerous place for walkers?","bodyText":"Standing on the Maiden Moor ridge above Derwentwater last Sunday, I was at once depressed and exhilarated. Depressed because I had overestimated my strength and stamina – a common fault among men of a certain age. I'd thought I could whip round the six magnificent peaks that surround Newlands Valley and be at the jetty at the foot of Catbells to catch the last boat to Keswick at 4.40pm. But its departure time came and went and I was still three miles away and 500m above the shoreline. From my viewpoint I could just glimpse a speck in the distance floating across the lake without me. My despair did not last. The sun was shining. (In the Lake District! In March!) The clocks had moved forward that morning and I had light until 8pm. I could keep walking without anyone or anything stopping me. I trudged down the long ridge and followed the path to Keswick through woods and fields. The change in colour and mood as mountain turned to valley, and the glimpses of the first buds on trees, were indeed exhilarating, until I reached Keswick and re-entered the Britain where the interests of walkers come last. The path stopped just before a T-junction where the main route out of town meets a side road. One branch of the T leads to Keswick's bus station. People famously run for buses, but there was no pedestrian crossing to take them across the road. Even in a national park that sells itself as a place where walkers can escape our odious streets, the authorities had not taken basic precautions. \"One day a driver will kill someone here,\" I thought. The next evening I picked up the Carlisle News and Star and found that while walkers around Keswick had been spared, four people had died on Cumbria's roads that day. The crashes made the local press, but the nationals did not bother with them. Death comes so often on the roads, its visits are not worth covering: particularly when the dead were on foot. As I was climbing fells and missing boats, the London assembly was issuing a doubtless vain appeal to stop the killing of walkers. More pedestrians are killed or seriously injured on London's streets than any other type of road user, its members said. They were \"astonished\" to find that a quarter of the deaths occurred on pedestrian crossings – which are meant to be places of safety. Others were inflicted by bus drivers, who, despite being privatised, are meant to be publicly accountable, and by the drivers of heavy goods vehicles, who are also meant to meet minimum safety standards. Few in authority cared. Not one of the Metropolitan police's 32 boroughs listed the enforcement of traffic law as a priority. Deaths on the road are to today's criminal justice system what domestic violence was in the past: as natural and inevitable as the weather. What applies in London applies nationally. You would never guess it from British society's obsession with crime but there are three times as many road deaths each year as there are homicides. As the campaign group Road Peace says, the budgets for collision investigations are tiny when set against the resources the police throw at murders. If I write with feeling, it is because I have become a regular walker for the first time since I was a teenager. Eighteen months ago, I discovered that 17st 8lb could not be defined as a \"cuddly weight\", as I had imagined, but according to something called body mass index was better described as \"clinically obese\". I got down to 13 stone by heeding the NHS's wise advice to ignore fads. Rather than following the Dukan, Atkins, Paleo or 5:2 diets, I created my own \"do what your mother told you diet\". If you wish to join me on it, you should: ■ \"Eat your greens\" – although not even my mother foresaw a 21st century where nutritionists at University College London would insist on people eating seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day. ■ \"Stop scoffing all the cakes.\" ■ \"Stop eating between meals.\" ■ \"Never dare come back to my house in that state again\" – it turned out that four pints of bitter and a large bag of crisps before dinner are fattening. ■ \"Get some fresh air.\" In my case, trying to get some fresh air means walking whenever I can. It was only when I trudged their streets that I realised how the designers of Britain's towns and cities barely thought of walkers. Pelican crossings take you to traffic islands in the middle of main roads and leave you there. And it's not just bus stations: hospitals, including the vegephile nutritionists' own University College hospital, fail to provide safe, direct access for patients who might be trying to reach their entrances from the other side of the road. As the overweight British turn into a nation of human space hoppers, as global temperatures rise, and pollution burns our eyes, you might have thought politicians would encourage us to walk. Yet Britain does not have a \"walkers' lobby\" to apply pressure. Walking is the victim of a paradox identified by Mancur Olson Jr and Susan Lohmann in the 1960s. Special interests triumph over general interests in democracies, they said, because special-interest groups are highly motivated: cyclists, for instance, are finally getting a hearing because they tend to be young, professional and articulate. (I'm not knocking them. Despite myths to the contrary, cyclists hardly ever injure pedestrians.) Special interests can raise money for lobbyists and persecute politicians if they don't, in the case of roads, listen to the AA, RAC and Road Haulage Association. No powerful lobby, however, upholds the general interest in being able to walk without constraint or danger. There's no money in it and everyone expects someone else to put in the hard work. What Margaret Thatcher called the \"great car economy\" is dying all over the world. Even if you can ignore the wrecked environment, people no longer want to live, work or establish businesses in landscapes that are overwhelmed by cars. The most forward-thinking cities are following the Vision Zero model, developed by Swedes in the 1990s. They produced the road traffic equivalent of zero tolerance of crime. No death on the roads is acceptable, governments from the Netherlands to Bill de Blasio's New York now join Sweden in saying. In aviation and every other perilous occupation, regulators take human error for granted. On the roads as in the air or in nuclear power stations, you cannot just blame people for making mistakes, but should design accidents out of the system by cutting speeds, drastically when necessary, and building barriers to prevent collisions. Not in Britain. The coalition abandoned targets to reduce road deaths so it could honour the Tories' promise \"to end the war on the motorist\". They did not stop to consider the mewling vacuity of their self-pitying slogan. Conservatives complain about others playing the victim card but, without a blush of shame, talk about \"the motorist\" as if he were a victim of Bashar al-Assad and imagine a \"war\" in which the enemy is a child who runs into a street. They follow that dismal reasoning by transferring the generalisations of identity politics to road safety. It never occurs to them that there is no such thing as \"the motorist\": the man or woman who only drives. Everyone walks. And, unless they're on the fells, everyone crosses roads. In 1947, JS Dean, then president of the Pedestrians' Association, produced a robust polemic in which he explained at length how the prewar countries that tolerated the highest level of road deaths were fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, with their contempt for life and cults of murder. \"Scratch a road hog, and you'll find a fascist,\" he declared, before asking a good question. When else in history has humanity lived with the \"foul, strange and unnatural\" belief that it should be \"common custom to kill and maim people because they get in your way\"? Almost 70 years on, that foul and unnatural belief remains as prevalent in Britain as ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/15/nuclear-power-after-the-flood","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T00:05:11Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: After the flood | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/15/nuclear-power-after-the-flood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/15/nuclear-power-after-the-flood","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: After the flood","bodyText":"The flattening of the whole town of Minamisanriku and the washing-up of thousands of bodies on the shores of the Miyagi prefecture are more than anything a human tragedy. But for westerners accustomed to marvelling at ingenious Japanese technical solutions to all manner of smaller problems, the unfolding horrors are something else too: a reminder of the frailty of the physical thread by which our whole civilisation hangs. Even without the explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the other terrifying images would have stirred scepticism about human attempts to harness forces greater than themselves. As it turned out, the great hydrogen blasts at reactors one and three were yesterday followed by a more dangerous failure of the cooling system in reactor two. The hundreds of millions of half-informed voters across the rich world, on whom consent for nuclear power ultimately rests, gazed on – bemused by the International Atomic Energy Authority's ill-judged attempt to soothe nerves by pointing to the dozens of Japanese reactors that had not blown up, and hoping against hope that the pumping of sea water into reactor two was not quite as desperate a measure as it sounded. In Japan, there will soon be fierce arguments about why so many reactors are built on the coast, and why any were placed near seismic faultlines. A wider debate is already echoing far beyond its shores. In Germany, where history instils an instinctive distaste for grand scientific and political claims about brave new worlds, the longstanding unpopularity of nuclear power is deepening. As editorialists picked up their pens yesterday, Angela Merkel qualified her pro-nuclear leanings, putting all her plans up for review and suggesting that everything needed thinking through afresh after the Japanese flood. Closer to home the energy secretary Chris Huhne is mulling over the collapse of the \"couldn't happen here\" argument. It may have washed with Chernobyl in Soviet Ukraine but will not survive if the worst-case scenario plays out in high-tech Japan. That may still not happen, and if even the mix of an 9.0 magnitude earthquake, an accompanying tsunami and a hydrogen explosion does not cause lethal meltdown, then the balance of the rational argument could conceivably be more in favour of nuclear in a month's time than it is today. But as one of two Liberal Democrat cabinet ministers landed with implementing outright breaches of the party's manifesto – the other being Vince Cable on student finances – the ambitious Mr Huhne is well aware that scientific factors are not the only ones involved here. He may be keen to find reason to re-close a mind that only recently opened to the nuclear option. For all the emotive force of events in Japan, though, this is one issue where there is a pressing need to listen to what our heads say about the needs of the future, as opposed to subjecting ourselves to jittery whims of the heart. One of the few solid lessons to emerge from the aged Fukushima plant is that the tendency in Britain and elsewhere to postpone politically painful choices about building new nuclear stations by extending the life-spans of existing ones is dangerous. Beyond that, with or without Fukushima, the undisputed nastiness of nuclear – the costs, the risks and the waste – still need to be carefully weighed in the balance against the different poisons pumped out by coal, which remains the chief economic alternative. Most of the easy third ways are illusions. Energy efficiency has been improving for over 200 years, but it has worked to increase not curb demand. Off-shore wind remains so costly that market forces would simply push pollution overseas if it were taken up in a big way. A massive expansion of shale gas may yet pave the way to a plausible non-nuclear future, and it certainly warrants close examination. The fundamentals of the difficult decisions ahead, however, have not moved with the Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/18/energy-sector-china-syndrome","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-18T20:00:11Z","webTitle":"Letters: Energy sector's China syndrome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/18/energy-sector-china-syndrome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/18/energy-sector-china-syndrome","fields":{"headline":"Energy sector's China syndrome","bodyText":"You quote a leader from the GMB (Nuclear expert raises fears over Chinese role in atomic plants, 18 October) as suggesting it is almost Orwellian to allow Chinese investment into our highly sensitive energy infrastructure, given that China has been linked to corporate hacking. The point is that the British government is guilty of Orwellian doublespeak. On one hand, we're told the Chinese are a threat to British interests with their industrial-scale hacking, yet George Osborne claims that paving the way for the Chinese to play a dominant role in the UK nuclear industry is a triumph for his diplomacy. The fact is that, post-privatisation, the energy sector was starved of investment for years. Our infrastructure is creaking and the government has to go cap-in-hand to the Chinese begging for money. Far from being a triumph of Osborne's diplomatic skills, British weakness has been laid bare. We are now utterly dependent on foreign state-owned companies to keep the lights on. Chinese companies already own large chunks of our gas, electricity and water infrastructure. The government's disastrous energy policy means it had an almost nonexistent negotiating hand in China. The GMB is pragmatic and recognises that the investment is desperately needed. But we see no sign of Osborne securing any guaranteed benefits for UK manufacturing. Meanwhile, the Chinese manufacturing supply chain and nuclear industries will benefit from having a controlling interest in the UK nuclear industry. Gary Smith National secretary, GMB commercial services section • The UK chancellor has just signed up to a deal where EDF and the Chinese get £14bn just for the construction of Hinkley C. The UK government has also promised profits to the French and Chinese with a guaranteed price which is twice the existing cost, beginning in 2025 for 35 more years, after which they walk away from the UK with their profits and leave all the waste behind for thousands of years. By 2025, electricity costs in the UK will already be lower than today's costs, as wind, wave, solar and tidal power become established and their initial development costs recovered (see Germany's success). For nuclear, the taxpayers will also pay for the waste and decommissioning – £100bn and counting just for legacy waste. Taxpayers will also pay all nuclear insurance costs, from construction to onsite spent fuel storage, for thousands of years. It's not rocket science; it's not even secondary school maths. We're being conned by false threats of the lights going out and outright lies that nuclear is carbon free. And let's not even start on the health costs – yet another example of international government cover ups which make Nineteen Eighty-Four read like a fairy tale. Jo Brown Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset • The Royal Academy of Engineering study, GB Electricity Capacity Margin, highlights the need to act now to avoid energy shortfalls. This report looks at a worst-case scenario where everything that could go wrong does go wrong all at the same time. The report highlights the need to facilitate a rapid move to deployment of new large-scale electricity generation to avoid supply shortfalls over the next 10 years, and also to enable the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Capacity is tightening and there is a need to progress market reform to the point where capacity gets built. However, the consequences of unfortunate combinations of events (such as cold winter combined with plant failures beyond normal levels) would not be national blackouts. There are tools already in place to manage such situations, including voltage reductions, commercial contracts for short-term reductions of demand by industry, and in extremis, controlled and localised power cuts for short periods. The Institution of Engineering and Technology has long argued for a balanced energy portfolio including nuclear and has drawn attention to the risks of uncertainty created by the lack of long-term strategic planning which is causing potential generators to hold off investing in new plant until the position on government support is clearer.

The new reactors planned by EDF for Hinkley Point are significantly larger than any existing power stations, meaning the national grid has to pay for extra standby electricity to stop the grid crashing if one of the reactors unexpectedly goes offline. National Grid said its decision to charge all generators for the cost was because \"increasing costs on larger users could delay the commissioning of large nuclear plants by a number of years\". The government is sensitive to the charge that its energy policies are contributing to increases in consumer bills. On Wednesday it released an analysis which predicted that bills in 2020 would be £166 lower as a result of climate change policies than they would be if the government did nothing. But experts said the National Grid's decision to spread the cost of extra standby capacity amounted to a subsidy for the new power stations. \"There is no justification for nuclear being exempted from paying the additional costs to the system other than to make nuclear look cheaper than it is relative to other sources of electricity,\" said Prof Catherine Mitchell, an energy policy expert at the University of Exeter. \"It is clear to me that were there a genuine, transparent and comprehensive examination of the costs and benefits to society of nuclear versus renewables, the latter would be of far greater value both in the short and long term.\" A spokesman for EDF, which is currently in tense negotiations with ministers over the minimum price it will be guaranteed for electricity from the reactors in coming decades, said: \"The costs of balancing the system and maintaining reserve have always been proportionally spread or socialised across all those on the system. The maintenance of such a reserve is to the benefit of everyone: customers, generators and suppliers.\" He added that large offshore windfarms would also benefit from the upgraded grid back-up system. However, an industry source with decades of senior experience in the sector said offshore windfarms would not be connected to the grid by a single cable and therefore not pose the same risk. \"All renewable generators are paying the additional costs here, but not causing the need. The cost should lie where it falls,\" he said. \"National Grid obviously had its arm twisted at some point. Its justification is unconvincing.\" A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change declined to comment on how the new grid costs were spread, but said: \"The system requires back-up reserve to be available because of the intermittent nature of some types of low-carbon generation and in case a large generator fails. This underlines the importance of having a balanced energy mix.\" Currently, the grid's back-up system plans for a major loss of up to 1,320MW a few times a year. But the two new reactors planned by EDF will have 1,600GW of capacity each, meaning the grid will have to increase its back-up to 1,800MW. Nuclear power stations can shut down at short notice owing to engineering problems or even a swarm of jellyfish blocking cooling water pipes, as happened in June 2011 at EDF's reactor at Torness in Scotland. \"Nuclear reactors need back-up, which is expensive and which its advocates tend to forget,\" said Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace. \"The spreading of the cost is another implicit subsidy to get huge nuclear plants built that people will be paying for without even realising it.\" A spokesman for National Grid, which consulted on the charging decision in 2010, said: \"The overwhelming response was that operating reserve and balancing costs should continue to be socialised across the industry, given that the system security it provides protects all those connected, from nuclear to gas to renewables.\" The UK's big six energy companies, most of which had nuclear interests at that time, backed the plan, but Westinghouse, which makes reactors, said: \"Charging on the basis of size more accurately reflects costs to users. Socialising the cost … is anti-competitive.\" The question of state-sanctioned support for new nuclear power, paid ultimately by consumers, has become a fraught one for ministers. In 2010, they promised there would be \"no public subsidy\", but ministers have since modified that to say no \"unfair\" subsidies, meaning the subsidies are available to a range of technologies. But in February the energy secretary, Ed Davey, admitted to MPs the funding mechanism could differ between technologies and even individual projects. EDF is likely to receive tens of billions of pounds via the minimum price agreement. The government also has to convince the European Union that its support for nuclear is not considered unfair under state aid rules. Doerte Fouquet, a lawyer specialising in EU law, said: \"This scheme for nuclear generators [cannot] be declared compatible with European state aid rules.\" Mitchell said the nuclear industry was set to enjoy other benefits as well. \"Renewables will be supported with 20-year contracts rather than nuclear's expected 40 years and the unknown costs of nuclear waste and accidents will also be placed on customers via government.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/16/george-osborne-boris-johnson-china-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-16T21:33:27Z","webTitle":"George Osborne and Boris Johnson: China syndrome | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/16/george-osborne-boris-johnson-china-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/16/george-osborne-boris-johnson-china-editorial","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne and Boris Johnson: China syndrome","bodyText":"Britain's politicians have seen the future. The economic sun, they discern, is fated to rise in the east. A preoccupation with China sprawls party boundaries. Chancellor Gordon Brown's speeches used to prattle off the millions of graduates, the billions of toys, and – on the dullest occasions – the number of photocopiers China was churning out. As PM, he headed for Beijing hawking Britain's financial services, and the next New Labour generation have fixed on the same theme: Liam Byrne's book Turning to Facing the East is soon to be followed by a Douglas Alexander-edited volume, with a chapter on \"China-proofing\" Britain. The People's Republic is inevitably named as a leading runner in David Cameron's \"global race\" rhetoric, and this week it has been the turn of George Osborne and Boris Johnson to board the slow boat in the hope of a quick sale. In a sense, all of these players are merely doing what any serious statesman has to: bending the knee to economic reality. After a third of a century, near double-digit growth really does start to tot up: China is already the top trading partner for most nations on earth, the biggest holder of foreign reserves and, of course, the workshop of the world. A medium-sized country which forfeited that last title 150 years ago cannot afford to ignore the market which has become the motor of global growth. British prosperity demands both Chinese investment, and a Chinese market for British wares. The UK retains a respectable 3% share in world trade, but badly underperforms in a People's Republic which buys only 1% of its exports from the UK. Messrs Osborne and Johnson are quite right to worry about that, and right, too, to hope to do something about it. In an economy where the state retains such a guiding hand (a feature of industrial life that Britain's Chinamania downplays), international statecraft inevitably has a role. So while the week's spectacle of politicians-as-merchants may be a little demeaning, it is perhaps necessary. Whether caused by the trip or merely announced to fit in with it, Beijing Construction Engineering Group's move to join an £800m consortium to invest in businesses around Manchester airport is something any chancellor would want to see. Likewise, for a UK economy that remains woefully City-dependent, it is certainly useful for sterling to join the small band of currencies which can be traded directly against the renminbi. Sadly, coalition realities restrict the scope for seizing China as \"the great opportunity\" Mr Osborne proclaims. The decidedly modest UK quota of 80bn yuan to invest in Chinese securities can hardly make Britain Beijing's offshore centre in Europe while London's referendum obsession puts a question mark over being in Europe. Likewise – and even before Mr Johnson rubbished the scheme – George Osborne's fast-track Chinese visas cannot convincingly demonstrate that Britain is open for business, when the wider policy is to make the UK \"a hostile environment\" for outsiders. Britain's supplicant status during the trip has produced some depressing – and gratuitous – twists. The chancellor publicly drew a line under David Cameron's love-in with the Dalai Lama last year, and there has been no discussion whatever of the democratic rights, which every stock speech at home insists is worth more than money. The emerging deal to pour Chinese lucre into Hinkley Point nuclear power station was yesterday reported as being likely not merely to guarantee investors a fixed price for many years, but – at a time when power prices are salient – an exceptionally high price. Most dismaying of all is the licence to Chinese banks to open UK branches – as distinct from subsidiaries – which are free to trade in the City without the same regard for all those pesky post credit-crunch rules. Where Britons once sought to blow open Chinese market with gunpowder, today the UK noisily boasts (and nervously hopes) that it can become a favoured Chinese trading hub. Britain grasps, then, that history has changed; the pertinent remaining question is whether we have learnt the right lessons from it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-24T14:02:36Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband's energy price freeze pledge is a timely but risky move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband's energy price freeze pledge is a timely but risky move","bodyText":"When he was energy secretary, Ed Miliband warned that nothing could stop rising household gas and electricity bills. \"There is no low-cost energy future,\" he said. But four years on the Labour leader has decided not to accept this premise as an inevitability. He told Labour's conference that his government would simply order companies to freeze their prices until 2017. The announcement, potentially saving each household £120 a year, comes amid speculation that the big six energy companies are once again planning to put up tariffs for winter. With energy bills at a record high of £1,315 a year, politicians are well aware of the surveys saying Britons rank gas and electricity as their biggest financial worry. Prices have been rising at around 9% almost annually for the past five years, adding £300 to the average bill over the course of this parliament, while multibillion-pound profits made by the utility companies have soared by more 70% in that time. Public anger has been stoked further by accusations that the big six – British Gas-owner Centrica, EDF, Npower, SSE, E.on and Scottish Power – tend to raise bills in quick succession when wholesale gas prices go up, but fail to cut them when the market falls. Consumer group Which? believes market flaws mean consumers have paid almost £4bn too much since 2010. Freezing prices appears to be a simple remedy but Labour is likely to face an almighty battle with the energy companies if the party wins power in 2015. Unsurprisingly, the companies deny all charges that they make excess profits and claim they are unfairly targeted by politicians. They argue higher international gas prices and green taxes are to blame for inflation-busting increases in bills, which simply reflect the higher costs of supply. They also insist those profits are crucial if the government wants them to help keep the lights on by investing £100bn in gas plants, nuclear power, pylons, wind farms and other energy infrastructure. Any attempt to impose a price freeze could therefore provoke threats from the companies that they will no longer be able to help Britain replace its ageing power plants. Labour sources said the party is fully expecting to be hit with a judicial review from the energy industry but it has already taken legal advice that it is possible to regulate prices in that way. Critics may also argue there is a risk that the companies will try to hike prices in the runup to the next election, squeezing household and business budgets as the economic recovery is still fragile. Alternatively, there could be giant price rises at the end of the moratorium. However, Labour appears willing to risk a row. In a bonus for the party, it will force David Cameron to take his own action against rising bills or appear to back the energy companies against consumers. The prime minister has promised to ensure firms give the lowest tariff to their customers but charities and consumer groups believe this will not go far enough. They warn that millions of households are facing fuel poverty, with a growing number forced to cut down or switch off their heating in the colder months, with potentially dangerous consequences. Jenny Saunders, head of the National Energy Action charity, said she is extremely concerned that prices will rise again this winter. \"We are asking companies not to put prices up for people on the vulnerable customers list,\" she said. \"Leave them alone until they get through the winter months, that's all we're asking for.\" Miliband's promise of an energy freeze for all looks set to trump that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2013/sep/05/james-dyson-engineering-boom-government-support","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-04T23:02:00Z","webTitle":"James Dyson says engineering can boom if government backs sector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/05/james-dyson-engineering-boom-government-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/sep/05/james-dyson-engineering-boom-government-support","fields":{"headline":"James Dyson says engineering can boom if government backs sector","bodyText":"The government should stop talking up the opportunities for the UK digital sector and the \"silicon roundabout\", and concentrate more on the employment opportunities in engineering, according to the entrepreneur Sir James Dyson. The industrial designer made the comments as the company he founded under his own name announced a 19% increase in annual profits to £364m and announced plans to recruit 650 new engineers, 250 of whom would be found in Britain. Determined to push for even more innovation, Dyson said he was increasing the company's spending on research and development (R&amp;D) by 25% this year. The company already spends £1.5m a week. \"We hear a lot about Silicon Roundabout, but companies such as Facebook employ 4,000 people whereas Caterpillar [the tractor and digger manufacturer] has 150,000. Companies like mine, or Jaguar Land Rover, are booming. I am recruiting 650 highly trained engineers and scientists now but I could take on 2,000 if I could find them,\" he said. Dyson said that 50% of his company's £1.2bn sales in 2012 came from recently invented technologies, such as those employed in digital motors and cordless vacuum cleaners. The growth and success of the business was constrained only by a lack of skilled staff, he said. \"The government has done everything we asked for in our Ingenious Britain [policy blueprint] in the way of R&amp;D tax incentives and the rest. But we can't get enough engineers – 88% of postgraduate students in Britain are from outside the EU and they are taking their technology skills back home with them. We need [ministers] to talk up the opportunities in engineering at every opportunity.\" Dyson will be paying its new postgraduate British recruits £33,000 a year plus a £3,000 \"golden handshake\" to work at the firm's head office and R&amp;D base in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The firm switched its manufacturing to Singapore and Malaysia in 2002 but said the advantage was not the cost of wages or equipment but the huge local supply chains that made it easy to source parts. Dyson has just spent £150m on a new high-tech motor plant in Singapore. The entrepreneur insisted he had moved assembly functions overseas because he had been refused planning permission to increase the size of the Malmesbury plant, although trade unionists said he was looking at the time for cheaper labour. Dyson said the company remained British and although the washing machines, vacuum cleaners and hand dryers were assembled in Asia, the exports were all billed through the UK. In 2012 the company paid £65m in domestic corporation tax although it now sells all over the world, with Japan one of its fastest growing markets. The firm's upright vacuum cleaner was becoming a brand leader in the US, Dyson said. He added that there was nothing stopping British engineering firms being world leaders but the key was to spend heavily and carefully both on new designs and products. When Dyson was manufacturing in Wiltshire, the company was making 800,000 machines a year but that number has now reached up to 9m. Dyson said he was also worried that new thinking was absent from the energy debate in Britain. He said he remained highly sceptical about the value of windfarms and believed the government should invest in new forms of nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2013/sep/23/angela-merkel-successful-world-leader-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-23T16:05:46Z","webTitle":"Want to be a successful world leader?

Do it the Angela Merkel way","bodyText":"Angela Merkel is one of only two EU leaders to have survived the economic crisis (she has done more than that; she has triumphed). She is set to become Europe's longest-serving elected female head of government; Forbes magazine says she is the second most powerful person in world. Yet she has little style and less charisma. She is not a good speaker. She takes for ever to make decisions, and displays no obvious political vision or even ideology. So what are the keys to her success? Could other world leaders take a leaf or two from her book? 1. Be pragmatic and methodical at all times It helps, perhaps, to have known the rigours of a planned economy, and cultivated a scientific mindset studying quantum physics. But mainly, it's a character thing: as a child, Merkel wanted to know in advance what her Christmas presents were, \"even if it spoiled the surprise. It mattered more to give structure to my life and to avoid chaos.\" Her task, she says, is \"to advance and solve problems. Even if it is only a few centimetres.\" 2) Avoid risk at all costs In a similarly revealing anecdote, Merkel has said that while still at school she once stood on a diving board for a full hour before being able to jump: \"That's how I am; not particularly courageous. I always need time to weigh up the risks.\" Know the policies – same-sex marriage, female employment quotas – that look like trouble, and leave them to others. Say: \"Personally, I'm all in favour. Sadly, we just can't implement them right now.\" 3) Deliberately dull the issues Go further and defuse the fiercest conflicts with your opposition. Grab the middle ground by stealing your opponents' most popular policies – abandoning nuclear power, raising social security benefits for families, capping rent rises, promising a minimum wage – but promise your own supporters that none of this will lead to tax hikes. Lull opposition voters into a false sense of security; persuade them they can safely stay at home. Then you can run on popularity, not issues. 4) Know what your country wants When an opportunity arises, for example, to go to war, don't. Your people really, really don't want to. Play safe on Iraq; commit the bare minimum to Afghanistan; oppose intervention in Libya and Syria. 5) Have a plan – but never reveal it In fact, never mention plans, visions or ideologies. In public, stick to homilies about \"good housekeeping\" – but in private, pursue and attain your objectives. There exists, allegedly, a Merkel plan to save the euro, on a single piece of paper. But has she ever disclosed her game? Has she heck. 6) Be ruthless within your party Chancellor Helmut Kohl made Merkel, but in 1999 she broke ranks and declared, in a front-page newspaper article, that the campaign finance scandal he was embroiled in had wrecked the CDU. The following year, she took over a party in which, even today, she has no serious rival. 7) Be mum to a country But make sure it's Germany. \"Mutti\", the Germans call her. She gets them; they get her. She makes few mistakes, and when she does – she initially downplayed the euro crisis – she gets away with it. But when all's said and done, Germany works (in both senses of the word) and is prospering. Which, perhaps, makes it easier to look like a good mum. • This article was amended on 24 September 2013. An earlier version referred to Angela Merkel as head of state. She is the chancellor and therefore head of government. The president, Joachim Gauck, is head of state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/12/report-expansion-experimental-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-12T10:24:38Z","webTitle":"Report calls for huge expansion of experimental nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/report-expansion-experimental-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/12/report-expansion-experimental-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Report calls for huge expansion of experimental nuclear plants","bodyText":"The UK will need to develop a huge fleet of currently experimental nuclear reactors by the middle of the century, to generate around two-thirds of the country's electricity supply if it is to meet the most nuclear-intensive scenario for moving away from fossil fuels, according to a report by three of the government's most senior scientific advisers. The expansion would involve developing nuclear generation technologies that are not currently used commercially anywhere in the world, and would also entail a huge expansion from the current electricity contribution of nuclear power to the UK grid. In 2011, nuclear supplied 18% of electricity demand. If each reactor has the generating capacity of the Hinkley Point power station that would mean at least a trebling of the current number of reactors – 16 at nine different sites around the country. The eventual number could be much higher because the new unconventional reactors are expected to have a smaller generating capacity. The expansion is necessary to fill the gap left by fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which the government has pledged to phase out to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The report, which is not yet published, encourages development of unconventional alternatives such as \"fast reactors\" powered off nuclear waste, designs using thorium rather than uranium, and even fusion power. It implies they could help nuclear to provide as much as two-thirds of UK electricity by 2050. Sir John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser, along with David MacKay, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) chief scientific adviser, and John Perkins, scientific adviser to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, are the report's authors. They have already made \"a number of recommendations\" to ministers based on findings in the report, a Decc spokesman said. Some of the alternative reactors can burn plutonium \"waste\" as fuel. GE Hitachi is in discussions with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and with Decc to construct two of its Prism fast reactors to burn some of the 100 tonnes of plutonium at Sellafield, helping resolve the waste controversies. The billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson is among those who have expressed support for fast reactors. Other technologies highlighted in the Civil Nuclear Industrial Strategy report include the use of thorium, a radioactive chemical element – the proponents of which say is more efficient than uranium and is more difficult to make into a nuclear weapon. Researchers also want to fashion them into small, \"modular\" sizes that are more affordable and easier to produce than today's large nuclear power stations, and even transportable. The report was commissioned in response to a 2011 House of Lords select committee report warning the government risked becoming complacent about the UK's nuclear power research and development (R&amp;D) skills and knowledge. It looks at what would be needed to deliver the more nuclear-heavy of four government scenarios outlined in 2011, which examined how to meet the UK's target of cutting carbon emissions 80% by 2050. The news comes after a rocky fortnight for conventional power, with Centrica pulling out of a partnership with EDF to build new reactors, MPs warning over the £67.5bn cost of waste at Sellafield and Cumbria council rejecting plans for an underground waste-disposal site. A Decc spokesman said of the report: \"In order to potentially deliver against the upper end of this scope, it is likely that more advanced and diverse options will need to be explored by the market.\" He added: \"Ensuring that these options are not foreclosed or essential skills lost will be an important long-term objective, and the R&amp;D roadmap element of the work will set out a number of pathways and key decision points for any future R&amp;D programmes to consider.\" The report is due to be published in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/01/ukraine-warns-russia-military-crimea-intervention-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-02T08:17:00Z","webTitle":"Ukraine PM warns of war as Russian military seizes control in Crimea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/01/ukraine-warns-russia-military-crimea-intervention-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/01/ukraine-warns-russia-military-crimea-intervention-war","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine PM warns of war as Russian military seizes control in Crimea","bodyText":"Ukraine has put its armed forces on full alert and warned Russia that military intervention will lead to war shortly after Vladimir Putin gave the green light for an invasion as the upper house of the Russian parliament unanimously approved his request to send troops into the neighbouring state. After a three-hour meeting with security and defence chiefs on Saturday, prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk said he had called for talks and urged Russia to return its soldiers to base in the Crimea region during a phone call with his counterpart Dmitry Medvedev. \"Military intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia,\" Yatseniuk said. Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, said he had put the armed forces on full readiness because of the threat of \"potential aggression\" as 15,000 Russian troops were said to have joined those who have effectively seized Crimea. Speaking live on TV, Turchynov said he had also ordered stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic infrastructure. Putin told the US president, Barack Obama, during a 90-minute call on Saturday night that Russia had the right to protect its interests and those of Russian speakers not only in Crimea but also in east Ukraine. Obama called on Russian forces to pull troops back to base in Crimea and not interfere elsewhere. He also warned Putin that Russia faced greater political and economic isolation. The White House said in a statement: \"President Obama expressed his deep concern over Russia's clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is a breach of international law.\" The US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, told his Russian counterpart on Saturday that Moscow's military intervention risked creating further instability and an escalation \"that would threaten European and international security,\" the Pentagon said. Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he would hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis after Ukraine asked it, the US and EU \"to look at all possible mechanisms for protecting its territorial integrity\". Tensions escalated into the night when two Russian anti-submarine warships appeared off Crimea's coast, violating an agreement on Moscow's lease of a naval base, a Ukrainian military source was quoted as saying. The two vessels, part of Russia's Baltic Fleet, had been sighted in a bay at Sevastopol, where Moscow's Black Sea Fleet has a base. Obama's national security team met to discuss policy options, according to a senior administration official, while David Cameron said: \"There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine – a point I made to President Putin when we spoke [on Friday]. Everyone must think carefully about their actions and work to lower, not escalate, tensions. The world is watching.\" Foreign secretary William Hague said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the Russian parliament's decision to use troops in Ukraine. He said: \"This action is a potentially grave threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" After several days of Russian stealth, the move to deploy forces came suddenly and decisively. The Kremlin said Putin wanted troops in Ukraine \"until the sociopolitical situation is normalised\". Less than an hour later, in a hastily convened extraordinary sitting of Russia's Federation Council that was laced with cold war rhetoric, senators voted unanimously to support Putin's proposal, and proposed withdrawing Russia's ambassador to the US in protest at an \"insult to the Russian people\" from Obama. Earlier in Kiev, Turchynov, who has been in power since president Viktor Yanukovych fled a week ago, convened a special session of the cabinet, and spoke by telephone with the US secretary of state, John Kerry. Former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, a leading candidate in presidential elections set for 25 May, had called for parliament to convene and order a full mobilisation of the army. The United Nations security council was due to hold an emergency session to discuss Ukraine on Saturday night. In London, William Hague said that Russia's ambassador to Britain had been summoned to the Foreign Office. The Russian decree does not limit the use of troops to Crimea, specifying only that the Russian military could be deployed \"on Ukrainian territory\", and the big question is how far the Kremlin wants to go. So far, Putin's statement only talks about \"protecting the interests of Russian citizens and compatriots\", but there are fears that Moscow is planning a full-scale annexation of Crimea, with its majority ethnic Russian population. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that no decision to implement the decree had yet been taken. Ominously, there were also clashes in the major eastern Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk on Saturday, with the deputy mayor of Kharkiv saying that 97 people had been injured in violence between supporters of the new government in Kiev and pro-Russian demonstrators. Putin's move comes after two days during which the Kremlin's motives were unclear. Armed men seized the Crimean parliament on Thursday and the peninsula's airports on Friday, but claimed to be members of locally organised \"self-defence squads\". Ukraine had already accused Russia of a \"military invasion and occupation\" of Crimea. Michael McFaul, until last week the US ambassador to Russia, castigated the Kremlin: \"Russian companies and banks with business in the west will suffer as a result of reckless Putin decision. Will they speak up?\" he tweeted. But the parliamentary session roundly dismissed western criticism in advance. Senator Nikolai Ryzhkov said Russia should be prepared for the west to \"unleash their dogs on us\". \"They ruined Yugoslavia, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, all in the name of western democracy. It's not even double standards, it's political cynicism.\" Late on Friday night, Obama told Russia there would be \"costs\" for intervention in Ukraine. A senator in the Federation Council said it \"crossed a red line\" and \"insulted the Russian people\". The parliamentary body said it would ask Putin for the Russian ambassador to the US to be withdrawn. However, actual signs of violence have been limited. The Russian foreign ministry claimed on Saturday that armed men \"from Kiev\" had tried to seize the government building in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, but had been repulsed by self-defence units, who took casualties. On the ground, nobody could offer any evidence of such an attack. Yanukovych, who gave a press conference in the southern Russian city of Rostov on Friday at which he claimed he was still the legitimate president, has called the new government Nazis. His role is now unclear, but the Federation Council said he had approved the use of Russian troops. He fled after signing a compromise agreement with opposition leaders, in the presence of three EU foreign ministers. Russia has blasted the EU for failing to keep the opposition to its side of the bargain. Yanukovych's flight from Kiev was the culmination of three months of protest, ending with 82 people being killed in clashes with riot police. Ukraine's new government has disbanded the Berkut riot police involved in clashes with protesters, while Russia has announced it will give them Russian passports. The first of them collected passports at a Russian consulate in Crimea on Saturday. In Crimea on Saturday, there were more pro-Russia rallies, and the region already appeared under the control of Russian troops and pro-Russian militias, who were patrolling the airports, parliaments and roads in and out of the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/jun/30/stephen-emmott-windfarms-not-the-answer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-29T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"Stephen Emmott Q&A: 'Windfarms are not the answer to our problems'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/30/stephen-emmott-windfarms-not-the-answer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/30/stephen-emmott-windfarms-not-the-answer","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Emmott Q&A: 'Wind farms are not the answer to our problems'","bodyText":"Why have scientists and politicians been slow and reluctant to confront population growth? It might be useful to first distinguish between growth and behaviour. The problem is less the current number of us in itself (yet) but more the way the majority of the 7 billion of us live and consume. This is principally the cause of almost every global problem we face. Critically, every one of these problems is set to accelerate as we continue to grow. \"Confronting\", as you put it, the way we live and consume is not something politicians want to do. Doing so would be immensely unpopular. And politicians do like to be popular. Indeed, our entire political systems are set up for the opposite: to promote and encourage us to increase our consumption and irresponsible behaviour. As for scientists – my colleagues, I should add – the vast majority choose to do what I have chosen not to do; to keep their heads well below the parapet on this lot. Do you think Thomas Robert Malthus was wrong only in terms of timescale? The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus (FRS, no less) was wrong about many things. Indeed the chap held a fairly broad range of opinions which fell into the \"dubious to odious\" categories. But on population, his basic argument – that when the population exceeds the means to sustain it, the result is going to be \"misery\" (in Malthus's words) – remains remarkably difficult to reject. It's interesting that he wrote this despite being witness to the benefits of the agricultural revolution, and the emergence of the industrial revolution, which to most were seen as \"a new age\" of human progress. So, was he wrong only in terms of timescale? Well, he doesn't really set out a timescale in his 1798 An Essay on the Principle of Population, so the answer has to be no. When did you first become engaged with these issues? Was it something you dwelt on, growing up in Yorkshire? Up until a decade ago this was not natural scientific territory for me. I am a neuroscientist by training. But my life for the past decade has been devoted to creating and leading a new laboratory dedicated to better understanding the systems we all rely on, and which are changing rapidly: the climate, the global carbon cycle, the planet's ecosystems. Although I don't have a particularly optimistic view of our future, as a scientist I have a responsibility to do all I can to try to find solutions. So we also do research into energy, specifically a potentially radical new form of energy – artificial photosynthesis, and into \"programming life\" – that is, the rational design of biological function, to, for example, \"program\" plants to be resistant to water stress, pests and fungal diseases. Is your conclusion, that \"we are fucked\", a good place to start the debate from? The problem is that I don't see much debate happening. So it's hardly surprising that I think we're fucked. The whole point in writing the book is to try to get us to think about the problems we face in a way we just haven't thought about them before, and hopefully to act as a catalyst for a global debate. But this needs to be a different debate than just some one-dimensional discussion about \"population\" or \"climate\" or \"going green\". The debate we urgently need to have is about us – about how billions of us live, behave, consume irresponsibly, about how billions more want to live, behave and consume. And about how another 3 billion that have not yet been born will, or want to, do the same. You mention that your lab is engaged in replicating photosynthesis. How close to that goal are we? Not as close as I would like. We have a research effort under way in artificial photosynthesis, in collaboration with some brilliant colleagues at the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge University. I am aiming to have a proof of concept of a scalable system in under five years. Ours is not following the typical approach, that of the search for a solid-state material to split water and extract the resulting hydrogen, but the direct production of electricity by exploiting the kind of quantum-coherent effects that photosynthetic organisms (plants and bacteria) employ. I think this is a better direction to pursue but it is also an incredibly ambitious one. You presented Ten Billion on stage at the Royal Court in London last year. Was the theatre a good medium for this message? It was enjoyable. The obvious limit of theatre is that it imposes a fairly heavy constraint on getting the message out – only a small number of people can listen. Interestingly, overwhelmingly, the people who came to speak to me at the talk, and everyone in my lab, and all my friends, all said: \"Everyone should hear this message. You must write a book.\" So I did. If you had been around the table at the G8 last week, what three priorities would you have been pressing for? First, to get all those chaps to get their ties put back on. It looks wrong, that open-shirt caper. Or perhaps to have taken Barack to one side and reminded him that the chancellor is not called Jeffrey. Can I have four? The two most important priorities would have been to urge them to treat the situation we're in with the same urgency we'd give if we'd just discovered an asteroid on a collision path with Earth, likely to wipe out 70% of all life. And I'd have pressed them to live up to their role as leaders, and marshal government, businesses and scientists worldwide into unprecedented action to address the problem with the same seriousness we would give to the asteroid scenario. Do you drive a car? Yes. Once a week I drive a used hatchback I bought secondhand about five years ago to Waitrose. And back. Should we forget about windfarms and put our energies into nuclear power? We should put a lot more of our energies into reducing our consumption of energy, not least the energy needed to produce and transport and power all the stuff we consume that we don't need. But given that it's safe to assume that this isn't going to happen, then the answer to the specific question you ask becomes somewhat complex. Windfarms are definitely not the answer. They (and other \"green technologies\") might turn out to be part of the answer, but I struggle with claims that this is likely. Nuclear power could solve our energy challenges for the next half-century or so, but where's the massive building programme needed for this to become a reality? Nuclear power is so unpopular that I don't see it happening. In fact, rather than doing all we can to reduce our reliance on carbon and hydrocarbons, we're increasing our efforts to find, extract and use them. We (in Britain) look to the US shale gas and oil \"revolution\" and want to do the same. Our government recently issued 197 new licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea: the largest number since 1967. And our use of coal for electricity production increased by no less than 31% last year. The market economy and the insistence on growth is clearly currently a large part of the problem. Can it ever be part of the solution? That's a very good question. Our entire market economy and the way corporations work need to be changed. We need to urgently move away from corporate success being based on who is most effective in influencing government regulation, avoiding taxes and obtaining subsidies for harmful activities to maximise the returns of just one stakeholder – shareholders – to one based on resource conservation, genuine innovation (not just technological innovation) and the satisfaction of multiple stakeholder demands. Given the apparent impossibility of educating people to stop, say, using plastic water bottles, shouldn't politicians be legislating them out of existence? Many people will say that, on the contrary, it's anything but impossible to get people to change their behaviour, with current thinking being that this can be achieved through \"nudge\" efforts. Isn't there a \"nudge unit\" in No 10? I struggle with much of the rhetoric of the nudge claims. Legislation has to be part of the solution. The principal reason lung cancer has declined is because of legislation on smoking. Would you favour the adoption of Chinese-style birth rate policies across the world? No. Did your work influence your own decisions about family? I don't have children. My work has not influenced this outcome (other than perhaps as a consequence of doing little other than working). Are you vegetarian? I'm an omnivore. That said, I don't eat a lot of meat. All cultures and societies throughout history have had a strain of apocalyptic prophecy – why should we think we are different? There is no evidence that we have reason to believe we are different. How has the financial crisis affected this debate? It's had no effect whatsoever. This is remarkable since it's patently clear we're creating the equivalent of this so-called \"once in a century\" financial crisis every year in terms of the purely economic cost of the degradation and loss of the services nature provides for us, and which we are entirely dependent upon. It's just that we don't have to pay the cost of this now. But the cost of the loss of the things that nature provides for us will have to be paid for – by our children and grandchildren. How do you sleep at night? I've usually been working from 8am to 1am, so getting to sleep isn't a problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2013/oct/29/natural-disasters","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T07:10:00Z","webTitle":"St Jude storm: south wakes up to trail of death and damage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/natural-disasters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/natural-disasters","fields":{"headline":"St Jude storm: southern Britain counts the deaths and damage","bodyText":"Britain faces further disruption through Tuesday following the most powerful storm to hit Britain in years. Authorities continue to clear away debris and fallen trees while engineers work to restore power to hundreds of thousands of homes and rail services slowly return to normal. A 17-year-old girl was among four people killed as hurricane-force winds battered England and Wales, leaving a trail of destruction. Dubbed St Jude after the patron of lost causes, the storm caused transport disruption on road, rail, air and sea, and power cuts for hundreds of thousands of homes. National Rail said it was not yet able to say how services would be affected on Tuesday but urged travellers to check with their train operator, while ferry services from Dover are still delayed because of rough seas. Up to 166,000 homes across England were still without power over Monday night. The storm, which is now over Scandinavia, will be replaced with far lighter winds and rain in Britain but dozens of areas in southern England remained on flood alert, the environment agency said. Insurers were counting the cost of the storm but said it was too early to tell whether it would compare with the multi-billion pound hits caused by previous severe weather events. Initial estimates of the level of financial damage wrought are not expected until later this week, the Association of British Insurers said. During Monday morning winds of up to 100mph swept through the south-west, south, south-east, the midlands and the east of England after first hitting land in the early hours. Up to 2.4 inches of rain – half the monthly average – fell in a few hours during the storm in areas including Hampshire and Devon, causing flash floods. Bethany Freeman was crushed and killed as a 30ft tree fell on the caravans she and her family were living in while renovation work was taking place at their home at Edenbridge in Kent shortly after 7am. Known as Gia, she was a \"universally respected\" sixth-form pupil at Tunbridge Wells Grammar School who \"had everything to look forward to\", the school's website said. There were tragic scenes as her driving instructor arrived at her home in Lydens Lane to pick her up without knowing she had died. Father-of-three Donal Drohan, 51, originally from Waterford in Ireland, died after his car was hit by a tree at the bridge over the river Colne in Watford. An officer who attended the scene said that a millisecond's difference would have made for \"a different story\". The Harrow council worker's family said: \"He was the best husband and father anyone could wish for. You couldn't find anyone who had a bad word to say about him.\" In Hounslow, west London, three houses were completely destroyed and two more were damaged by an explosion, thought to have been caused by a ruptured gas main. Officers were called to Bath Road at around 7.30am and at noon they found a man's body at number 47 amid \"scenes of devastation\". An hour and a half later a woman – whom investigators were trying to identify – was found dead at the same property. Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young warned the public to remain alert in the storm's aftermath. John Lee, a forecaster for the MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said it was the most powerful storm in years. \"There will no doubt be some disruption still following the damage caused by strong winds and heavy rain, but the weather will be quite different,\" he said. \"It will be blustery with some showers, especially in the west, but a lot lighter. \"On Friday there is an indication that stormy weather could return, but it's likely to bring heavy rain rather than strong winds.\" The Energy Networks Association said 459,000 homes suffered power cuts across England, with 166,000 still disconnected. The port of Dover in Kent had to be shut, train and tube services were disrupted, more than 130 flights at Heathrow airport were cancelled and many roads were impassable due to fallen trees. Debris falling on to powerlines caused a nuclear power station in Kent to automatically close down both its reactors, leaving its own diesel generators to provide power for essential safety systems. Experts said the gales were relatively weak compared with the Great Storm of 1987 but the event showed how much weather predictions had improved compared with 26 years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2013/may/22/iran-nuclear-iaea-report-plutonium","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-22T22:38:44Z","webTitle":"Nuclear watchdog raises Iranian plutonium concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2013/may/22/iran-nuclear-iaea-report-plutonium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2013/may/22/iran-nuclear-iaea-report-plutonium","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear watchdog raises Iranian plutonium concerns","bodyText":"While the presidential election campaign gets underway in Iran, the International Atomic Energy Agency has produced its latest quaterly report on the country's nuclear programme, which does so much to shape the backdrop to Iranian politics - and not in a good way. The IAEA Safeguards Report has been leaked, as tradition dictates, and is available online here courtesy of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). The most important single indicator that tells us how close to a conflict we might be, shows there is still breathing room for talks when the elections are over. The report says that Iran's stockpile of 20% enriched (a half-way house between low enriched uranium for nuclear power stations and weapons grade stuff for bombs) is now 182kg, which is up 15kg from the last report three months ago but still well below the 240-250kg that would be enough to make an initial warhead, if the Iranians decided to go for making nuclear weapons. That threshhold is where Binyamin Netanyahu lay down Israel red lines before the UN General Assembly last September. The Iranians have made a total of 324kg of this medium enriched uranium, but continues to process much of what it makes into oxide fuel, which is less of a proliferation concern, so it is not counted as being part of the critical stockpile. The rest of the report, however, makes clear that there is plenty more to worry about. It goes into particular detail about the heavy water reactor under construction in Arak. That has not been in the spotlight much until now because the uranium enrichment programme has been seen as a far more direct route to making a nuclear weapon. It still is. The Arak heavy water reactor, when operational, could produce plutonium if the spent uranium fuel was reprocessed, and plutonium can be used to make smaller, even more powerful nuclear warheads than weapons-grade uranium. To make it, however, Iran would need to build a reprocessing plant and there is so far no sign of that. But the reactor is getting closer to completion. A huge reactor vessel has arrived at the site but has yet to be installed, but a lot of other things have been put in place. [T]he following major components have been installed at the IR-40 Reactor: the containment overhead crane; the moderator and primary coolant heat exchangers, circuit piping and purification systems; the moderator storage tanks; and the pressurizer for the reactor cooling system. The Iranians predict the reactor, which they say is for research purposes, will be operational by the third quarter of 2014. Most observers don't think they will make that deadline. There is still a lot of stuff to be built, like the control room, the mechanism for refuelling the reactor and the cooling pumps. Still, by next year, if work proceeds at the current pace it is easy to see Arak become an serious source of international friction. The report also notes that IAEA inspectors have not been allowed to visit the production plant - which will supply the deuterium oxide (heavy water) for the reactor to function - since August 2011, and since then the agency has had to rely on satellite images. The IAEA goes into more detail that usual about its disagreement with Iran over when the government is supposed to tell the agency about new nuclear facilities. Under the original IAEA rules, a country only had to tell the agency about a new plant six months before nuclear material was due to be delivered for the first time. This was called Code 3.1. In the 1990's a modified Code 3.1 was introduced which said a new facility had to be reported as soon as the decision to built it had been taken. In 2003, Iran agreed to the new Code 3.1, but in 2007, it suspended its implementation, and now refuses to abide by it. You can read more about it here. This is important because of the suspicion that Iran could be building secret facilities. If tomorrow it was discovered that Iran had built a new underground enrichment plant like the one revealed at Fordow in 2009, Tehran would argue it was completely in its rights as it was not bound by the new Code 3.1. Thus the refusal to agree to the new code increases suspicion that there might be a parallel covert nuclear programme under construction. This uncertainty is heightened by the fact that various Iranian officials have announced in recent months that Iran is building four new research reactors, ten new enrichment plants and 16 new nuclear power stations, without saying where any of these facilities are located. All this, along with a complete lack of progress on agreeing guidelines for the IAEA's investigation into Iran's alleged past weaponisation work, adds up to a fairly negative report. It's not bad enough to get the war drums beating again, but sufficiently worrying to underline the importance of reaching some kind of compromise on the Iranian programme soon after the election is over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/29/nuclear-power-loses-appeal-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-29T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power loses its appeal after Japan crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/29/nuclear-power-loses-appeal-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/29/nuclear-power-loses-appeal-japan","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power loses its appeal after Japan crisis","bodyText":"Moves to cut carbon emissions in line with international targets have come under renewed strain since the nuclear crisis in Japan led some countries to shelve plans to use the technology. Switzerland became the latest country to decide to phase out nuclear power last week, citing concerns over the accident at the Fukushima plant that was left stricken by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in March. The Swiss decision not to build any new nuclear stations – three were in the pipeline – follows similar announcements in Germany, Italy and further afield in Thailand and Malaysia, where governments have opted to freeze or forgo plans to build nuclear power stations. The Swiss government said it would phase out nuclear power by 2034, a decision that requires the closure of five nuclear plants that provide 40% of the country's electricity. No plants will be phased out of use ahead of schedule, however. An estimated 20,000 people protested in Switzerland last weekend against nuclear power in the country. To make up the shortfall, Switzerland will be forced to rely more on hydroelectric power, much of which it now exports as green energy to neighbouring countries, including Germany and Italy. In Germany, Europe's largest economy and power market, seven nuclear power plants have been closed and plans to extend the running life of the remaining reactors have been put on hold pending the formation of a new energy policy due in July. The International Energy Agency warned on Friday that Germany's moratorium on nuclear power will add 25m tonnes a year to the country's carbon dioxide emissions. Plans to build nuclear power stations in earthquake-prone Italy have been halted, as have projects for five plants in Thailand. Malaysia, which had hoped to switch on its first nuclear station in 2021, will reconsider after reviewing the crisis at Fukushima. Ruling out nuclear power will make countries more reliant on low-carbon alternatives, some of which have yet to prove themselves on an industrial scale, such as carbon capture and storage, which removes carbon dioxide gas from fossil fuel power stations. \"The decision you make by excluding a technology is that you have to rely on the others. It doesn't necessarily mean your energy system is more carbon intensive or more costly, but you have to replace that excluded technology with something else,\" said Jeff Hardy at the UK Energy Research Centre. \"Some of the alternatives, like burning fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, are not yet proven at full scale, so if they don't deliver, or deliver late, that can affect your plans,\" he added. In a report by government advisers last week, nuclear power was singled out as the cheapest way for the UK to grow a low-carbon energy supply, at least over the next decade. The influential committee on climate change envisaged nuclear and renewable energy as having a 40% share each of the energy mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/dec/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-07T15:13:21Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake and tsunami triggers Fukushima fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-fears","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake and tsunami triggers Fukushima fears","bodyText":"Japan escaped largely unscathed on Friday after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake shook the north-east coast. It was, however, a chilling reminder of the 9.0 quake that struck the area in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and a triple meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Initially, the appearance on TV screens of a tsunami warning, and repeated announcements to remember last year's tragedy and flee the coast, prompted fears of a second disaster in less than two years in the worst-affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. Less than an hour later, a tsunami washed ashore in Ishinomaki, one of the hardest-hit towns in last year's tragedy, where the rebuilding process has barely begun. Mercifully, this time the wave was just a metre high. Two hours after the quake struck 150 miles offshore at 5:18pm local time, the meteorological agency cancelled its tsunami warning. Narita airport closed briefly for safety checks and phone lines were temporarily jammed by the large volume of calls. Several, much smaller, tsunamis lashed other parts of the coast, including Soma city, which lies just outside the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone imposed around the Fukushima plant. On Friday, as on 11 March 2011, the earthquake appeared to have cause minimal damage – testimony to the unrivalled ability of specially designed Japanese buildings to withstand violent seismic activity that could potentially kill thousands in many other countries. Buildings swayed for several minutes as far away as Tokyo; nearer the epicentre, where coastal towns and villages are largely deserted swaths of flattened land, people fled to higher ground. For all the relief that catastrophe had been diverted, Friday's earthquake would have added to the anxieties of the 325,000 people in the region still living in temporary accommodation. \"I was in the centre of the city the very moment the earthquake struck,\" Chikako Iwai, a resident of Ishinomaki, told Reuters. \"I immediately jumped into the car and started running towards the mountains. I'm still hiding inside the car. I have the radio on and they say the cars are still stuck in the traffic. I'm planning to stay here for the next couple of hours.\" Thoughts quickly turned to the Fukushima plant, declared stable by authorities a year ago but where workers have yet to begin the dangerous task of removing molten fuel from damaged reactors and the long, costly process of decommissioning. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said workers had been ordered to shelter inside buildings around the plant, but added that there was no sign of damage or radiation leaks. Police reported that five people had been injured, including a 75-year-old woman who fell while heading for higher ground. Thanks to Japan's warning system, people in the area had up to six minutes to take precautions between the first estimate of the quake's intensity and the moment it struck. The earthquake measured a lower five in Miyagi prefecture on Japan's scale of one to seven, which measures the amount of shaking a quake causes rather than its intensity. Earthquakes of that strength can damage older buildings and roads, which do not have the strict quake-resistant features introduced after more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in Kobe, in January 1995."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/03/nuclearpower-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-03T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"The incalculable cost of nuclear power | Thomas Noyes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/03/nuclearpower-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/03/nuclearpower-japan","fields":{"headline":"The incalculable cost of nuclear power","bodyText":"George Monbiot caused quite a stir recently when he declared that the Fukushima Daiichi disaster had confirmed him as a supporter of nuclear power as part of the solution for reducing carbon emissions. But the costs and uncertainties of the industry cast serious doubt on the prospects for a nuclear renaissance. Monbiot is not the first climate advocate to call for more nuclear power. Steward Brand, famous as publisher of the Whole Earth Catalog, has announced that he favours building more nuclear power because, as he puts it, \"coal is so awful.\" Such declarations are taken as evidence that environmentalists are becoming more hardheaded about energy economics. Monbiot complains that renewable energy advocates are using a double standard in assessing the economics, but nuclear power has never been able to stand on its own without government backup. If the costs and benefits of nuclear power are so attractive, where are the investors? At least with wind and solar power, it is possible to see the cost curve dropping to the break-even point in the near future. Nuclear power, by contrast, may never be able to convince investors to put their money down without government guarantees. The prospect of cost overruns, waste disposal and extended shutdowns are daunting enough. But mostly, it is the potential cost of catastrophic failure that scares away investors. Large-scale disasters, however rare, are colossally expensive, as well as dangerous. The first estimate of entombing the Fukushima plant is $12bn. And this doesn't include the other liabilities that could force the Japanese government to nationalise the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). Several years ago, I heard Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, say that commercial nuclear power won't be developed in the US without federal liability or financing guarantees. The risks, however remote, are so expensive that investors don't want to take them on, no matter what the return. Monbiot, Brand and others rightly point to the heavy health and environmental costs of coal power. Researchers from Harvard recently published a study titled \"Full cost accounting for the life cycle of coal\" (pdf) that calculates the full health and environmental costs of coal power in the US to be $175bn to $523bn annually. The costs in China, with its lax or nonexistent health and environmental protections, may well be much higher. Reducing the use of coal is perhaps the single most important thing we can do to reduce air pollution and protect our climate. The total costs of coal may be high, but the total costs of nuclear power are, in any meaningful sense, incalculable. Investors face cost overruns that could burn through even the deepest pockets. The true cost of waste disposal still is not known. The cost of decommissioning, even decades away, is also a big unknown. And the cost of catastrophic failure is more than a company as large as GE is willing to face. How can any investor calculate the return on investment with such large uncertainties? And yet the cynics still assert that nuclear power is more practical than renewable energy. Renewable advocates are finding ways to promote solar and wind energy – without requiring the feed-in tariffs Monbiot cites as too expensive. Looking at the bigger picture, I don't see why I or anyone should apologise for advocating developing energy resources that don't blow up and take their investors with them. The renewable energy advocates I work with are willing, and even eager, to discuss the full costs and benefits of all sources of energy. Supporters of nuclear power should be willing to hold themselves to the same standard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2014/may/20/good-energy-eco-technology-people-electricity-gas-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-20T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Good Energy: it’s not about technology anymore, it’s about people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/20/good-energy-eco-technology-people-electricity-gas-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/20/good-energy-eco-technology-people-electricity-gas-bills","fields":{"headline":"Good Energy: it’s not about technology anymore, it’s about people","bodyText":"“When you look at markets, the best thing is not to know what you know now. Because otherwise you just wouldn’t do it. If you knew everything, you would never make a decision.” Juliet Davenport set herself a simple but gargantuan task: to supply customers with renewably sourced energy. Her company, Good Energy, is one of a very few companies who do this – Co-op is another, Ecotricity is the one my mum uses, but the strides these companies have made between them are incredible. Davenport herself is a fascinating mix of hard-boiled analysis and lavish optimism, not so much feel the fear but do it anyway as finely calibrate the fear with mathematical modelling, map the fear in a number of different scenarios, then still do it anyway. We currently look at the energy market and see the Big Six in control of everything, consumers impotent in the face of price rises, competition between the companies scarcely functioning, and a market that has always sold itself on price point alone becoming ever more expensive. But 15 years ago, this situation wasn’t as pronounced, and the energy market was a pretty curious place for an environmentalist to start. It’s a testament to Davenport’s vision, therefore that, driven by climate change, this is where she began. “I wasn’t really a business person. I was interested in climate because I did atmospheric physics; as I got interested in the science, I could see that something had to happen here.” She went on to do a masters in economics and from there, she went to the EU and afterwards became a consultant; the final spur to setting up an energy company was a particular debate in the House of Commons, just before the Labour victory of 1997. “Essentially, they were meant to be discussing energy policy in the UK, and new technologies, where were we going in the future. There was a whole document, this huge file, inches thick, put together to discuss energy efficiency, energy futures … and they didn’t touch it, they didn’t even get to it, they just descended into a conversation about coal versus nuclear power. I just felt so depressed, and thought individuals were probably more interested and better informed in our energy future than anyone in politics.” Good Energy now has 40,000 customers, £40m in annual revenue, owns the UK’s first commercial windfarm, and has come top in the Which? survey for customer satisfaction in energy provision three years running. Karl Harder, co-founder of Abundance, has worked for years in this sector, and recalls, “I did quite a lot of work with Juliet when she was based in this council building, a little office with about six or seven people. Now they’re next door, with several office blocks, hundreds of staff, it’s been an incredible journey. If you didn’t have brands like Good Energy, environmentalism would just be charities and good intentions. She’s shown that it’s a business. A lot of the debates we’re having now, the pain we’re going through, because of the changing needs of the energy market, she recognised really early on. And she recognised that if you’re going to navigate through it, you’re going to have to connect people to the power they’re using.” Three primary goals The company is pretty stringent about what counts as a renewable; unlike some soi-disant renewables suppliers, it won’t use unsustainable biomass, and it won’t use unseparated waste (on the grounds that burning plastic is not that different from burning fossil fuels, even if it is a waste product and you didn’t dig it up just to burn it). Otherwise, they will take pretty much anything, from solar and wind to anaerobic digestion and cheese factories (yes, really – “When they clean the factory, it generates a load of bacteria. It’s called washing. You can reap power from it”). Good Energy itself has three simple aims: “To provide individuals with the opportunity to be part of this market, whether as investors or customers; to redirect some of the capital from the wrong place into the right place; and to try and make sure that legislative processes don’t exclude this marketplace, they allow it to work properly. I’m not always saying we do a brilliant job on that last point, but we do what we can.” That first aim is possibly the simplest of the three, both to explain and to execute: customers don’t really have to be brought in on environmental grounds. Good Energy’s average tariff is slightly cheaper than that of the Big Six; if they wanted to, they could sell themselves on price. But that’s not really the purpose of the enterprise, which is more about creating a new market, with a much broader base of generators, as well as some principles and maybe a concern for the future. Good Energy customers need very little persuading of the value of this vision: last time the company created a bond for people to invest directly in production (as well as choosing this for their supply), they had to close it after three weeks because they’d raised £15m (these instruments are limited by amount; they’d been aiming for £5m). That second aim is more contentious, the redirection of capital – Good Energy is a PLC, not a cooperative. There are ethical/green investors who question the role of profit in this sector, asking essentially, what’s the point of revolutionising energy if it’s going to be along traditional lines? “The whole reason we are a for-profit business is so that we redirect some of that massive capital that’s going off somewhere else, into this marketplace.” I agree with this; as much as I respect the more radical agenda of many greens, it tends towards a suffocating purism, dictating that you can’t start anything until it can overturn everything that went before. Davenport’s way seems faster. And the third point is perhaps the most crucial, even though – containing as it does the word “legislative” – for some it might sound like the most boring, but it is key because of the growing scale of renewable energy provision. There are a few things standing in the way of renewables getting the credit and funding and appreciation they deserve. The first is just a failure to celebrate the sector’s successes loudly enough. “In the early 90s, the renewables industry could collectively get into a room above a pub, and it’s now an international industry, a direct employer of 100,000 people in the UK. In 2012, it was producing around 10% of our usage in the UK – it’s bigger today. In the 90s, it was 2-3%.” Solar shines out Solar is a particular success story. “It’s had an incredible couple of years. It’s an amazing, disruptive technology in terms of what it can do. Suddenly, you’ve got up to half a million homes generating probably about 50% of their own power. That’s a complete mindset change. We’ve built an energy market over the past 50 years that assumes large central power stations with big wires transmitting. Suddenly, in the last two years, we’re delivering I think nearly 2GW of power from people’s homes.” This love affair with solar is reciprocated – Leonie Greene, from the Solar Trade Association, says of Davenport: “She’s absolutely brilliant, I have to say. She’s so knowledgeable on the market and how incredibly complicated grid systems work. I can’t rate them enough.” Along with the failure to champion the success of renewables, there’s been an perennial problem with the way the debate is framed. You hear constantly about green subsidies, and almost nothing about the financial support that goes from government to fossil fuels, which amounts to more money, with a different name. Furthermore, says Davenport: “People talk about feed-in tariffs not being socially progressive but you can make it socially progressive, if you just tweak it slightly. You can support a lot of people in fuel poverty by making them a priority in solar provision.” The reliability of renewables is constantly called into question, while nuclear energy and fracked gas, both years away from being market ready, are treated as money in the bank. “And people like to disbelieve, because in a sense, you can’t be wrong if you disbelieve. That’s what a lot of lobbying takes advantage of. It’s so difficult to know what’s going on behind closed doors, but I’ve heard the edges of conversations in which this new technology is being dismissed, and you’re thinking: ‘Of course it can work. Of course it can deliver. That dismissal tactic is used quite often in terms of keeping everyone else away.” Throughout the discussion, whether we’re talking about the frustrations of politics – the fact that the more successful renewables become, the more politicised their use – or the impossibility of knowing just how much vested interests will work against you, Juliet Davenport maintains a brisk confidence, an expectant, infectious certainty that it’s all going to work out. “We don’t have to do it the same way as we’ve always done it. We can change the way we run our economy; we don’t have to run it the way we’re running it now. One of the biggest changes of a decentralised energy economy is that you wouldn’t have six big powers, you’d have lots of people, and we as a society need to get comfortable with that. My view is that it could happen very fast. It’s not about technology anymore. It’s about people.” Visit the Good Energy tent at the Hay Festival from 22 May – 1 June.

If the proposed new reactors do generate 3.2GW, it should be noted that this is still only about 1.6% of UK energy, rather than electricity, needs. Though 3.2GW is not an inconsequential figure, there are three key weaknesses with new nuclear: cost, waste and long-term low-carbon goals. In terms of cost, it should be remembered that just five years ago the Department of Energy confidently asserted new nuclear would come in at around £33 to £41 per MWh. As your report has noted, EDF is seeking a £100 per MWh \"strike price\", locked in for 40 years, costing tens of billions to the taxpayer in subsidy. In addition, the planning inquiry did not have the opportunity to take into account that there is now no part of the country volunteering to host a deep-underground radioactive waste repository. This means neither the existing radioactive waste legacy, nor new Hinkley waste, has an effective long-term storage solution. The government can't simply ignore this fact. Finally, if we do spend so much money on a project lasting just 60 years, with such significant environmental risks, are we really pursuing long-term sustainable goals to reduce carbon emissions? I think not. We should pursue the renewable energy options that most of our economic competitors are successfully developing, with the vigour and political will being put into new nuclear. Councillor Bill Brown UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities Steering Committee • Ed Davey gives planning permission to the Hinkley C nuclear power station when scrutiny of the design safety (generic design assessment) remains uncompleted, when the location, design, safety, cost or even the availability of a final repository for the high-level waste it produces remain huge uncertainties, when the spent fuel from the plant will remain on the site for over a century, way past the date by which EDF will have faded from memory, when electricity demand is falling, when the links between ill-health in local children and routine emissions are being more strongly identified, when the emergency plans designed to evacuate large numbers of people in the event of a major off-site radiological accident remain unimplementable and when the ability to meet the two goals upon which nuclear's reintroduction were based – a reduction in climate change impacts and the bolstering of energy security – look increasingly thin. As I write, Fukushima is on the verge of yet another catastrophe. What sort of head-in-the-sand government have we lumbered ourselves with and what can we expect from a supine opposition? Pete Wilkinson Wilkinson Environmental Consulting Ltd • There will be absolutely no subsidy for nuclear power has been the constant reassurance from ministers for at least the past year. Now two new reactors are to be built at Hinkley Point and guess what – with the aid of massive subsidies. Yet again the government has caved in to relentless lobbying from multinational corporations.

The row, which jeopardises international negotiations on climate change, has been generated in part by the UK Liberal Democrats' U-turn on renewable energy. At stake is whether the EU opts for a 35% or 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and whether the bloc sets a firm target for renewable energy generation by 2030. The UK government is strongly opposed to a target for renewable energy generation, and its opposition has led to the impasse. At least five commissioners are understood by the Guardian to be holding out against the 40% target, encouraged by the UK's stance. The Guardian understands that the European commission's president, Jose Manuel Barroso, is now poised to intervene in the row, and may ditch plans for a renewable energy target in order to seal a deal on the 40% emissions reduction. The proposal for a new 2030 target of a 40% cut in emissions has been in the works for two years. . Several studies, including one undertaken for the EU, show that the EU could meet a 40% target without economic difficulty. But some commissioners are understood to be still arguing in favour of an emissions cut of only 35% by 2030, which opponents say is inadequate. The bloc is already on track to exceed its current target of cutting emissions 20% on 1990 levels by 2020, and will likely reduce emissions to 25% by then. However, as the biggest economies within the EU – including Germany, France and the UK – are all agreed that the 40% target should be accepted, the likelihood that the final proposal from the unelected commission will go against this is very small. The main row is now over the renewables element of the package, which Barroso is considering watering down or dropping to broker a compromise. The renewable energy target is strongly supported by major member states including Germany, France and Italy. The row has global resonance. Governments around the world have committed to publish pledges within their next year on their greenhouse gas emissions cuts beyond 2020, when current commitments expire, in preparation for a global conference on climate change to take place in Paris in 2015. At the Paris meeting, governments are expected to forge a new global agreement on climate change, binding both developed and developing countries to cut emissions in order to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The commission proposals have reached stalemate at this late stage in part because of the UK's insistence that there should be no renewable energy target for 2030. The current EU 2020 targets include a goal of producing a fifth of energy from renewable sources by 2020, an aim that is credited with assisting the substantial growth in clean energy across the bloc. Many countries want a similar – but more stringent – goal to be included in the 2030 climate and energy package. However, the UK is holding out against a 2030 renewables goal, preferring an emissions target alone. By contrast, major economies in the EU – Germany, France, Italy and five other member states – have taken a strong stand in favour of a renewables goal, writing to the European commission to say it was \"crucial to provide certainty ... [to] ensure cost-effective investments in energy systems\". Their support for such a target comes despite the claims of Edward Davey, the UK's Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, that his opposition to a 2030 renewables goal was \"getting traction\" among other member states. He only named one, Spain, whom he said was also behind the UK. The Spanish government did not reply to a request for comment. The countries signing the letter in favour of a renewable energy target included Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Portugal as well as Germany, France and Italy. The Liberal Democrats have previously strongly supported a renewable energy target, and their current stance against such a target has been criticised by green campaigners. The UK government's opposition to a renewables target, understood to be the result of a compromise within the governing coalition over climate policy – many right wing Tories are sceptical of climate change science, and the prime minister has been quoted as railing against \"green crap\" including renewable subsidies on energy bills – was first revealed by the Guardian in 2012. It is understood that the Treasury wants to be able to include nuclear power and fears that a renewable energy target would mean less investment in its favoured alternative, shale gas. Green MEPs and environmental campaigners are arguing in favour of much stronger target on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a strong renewable energy goal. Claude Turmes, vice chair of the Green Group of MEPs, said: \"This cynical intervention by Barroso to drastically scale back EU climate and energy policy at the behest of UK prime minister Cameron smacks of political desperation. Failure to include a binding renewable energy target would completely undo the indisputable success of the existing 2020 target in driving forward renewable energy. It is a sop to those countries like the UK that want to pursue risky or dirty energy from nuclear, coal and shale gas, and will totally undermine investor certainty.\" He added: \"All of this would fly in the face of the commission's own impact assessment, which highlights the clear economic and employment benefits of pushing for ambitious binding targets for greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy and energy savings.\" Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Genuine commitment on climate would see binding carbon cuts of at least 70% by 2030, as well as mandatory targets on energy efficiency and renewable power. But despite all the rhetoric about the need to slash emissions, the commission is still dancing to the tune of big polluters and energy-guzzling firms.\" A study by several academic research instutions, under the banner of the Stanford Energy Modelling Forum, found that increasing the current target of a 20% emissions cut by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, to a 40% target by 2030 would cost less than 0.7% of economic activity. Leading companies under the umbrella of the Prince of Wales EU Corporate Leaders Group have also endorsed the 40% target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/2012/jul/06/energy-green-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-06T11:46:04Z","webTitle":"Up in smoke: how efficient is electricity produced in the UK?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/06/energy-green-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/06/energy-green-politics","fields":{"headline":"Up in smoke: how efficient is electricity produced in the UK?","bodyText":"Huge amounts of energy are wasted every day in our gas, coal and nuclear power stations. Over half of the energy in gas and around two thirds of the energy in nuclear and coal used to produce electricity is lost as waste heat. Information is Beautiful has created a graphic for Friends of the Earth that illustrates just how much energy is lost in production and compares it to renewables sources, which lose less than 1%. It makes particularly interesting reading when considered alongside Good Energy's (one of our partners on the Clean British Energy campaign) recent graphic showing where our energy comes from. This graphic was produced using Government figures and also shows how electricity is used in the home as well as some information on how much money can be saved by taking some simple actions to reduce electricity use. Friends of the Earth's Clean British Energy campaign is calling for a transformation in the way Britain produces and uses energy. Their message is clear: Burning fossil fuels is a very inefficient way to generate electricity - much of the energy contained in the fuel is lost as heat. Renewables are much more effective at converting energy into electricity. That's one of the reasons why we need to shift the way we produce our electricity in the UK - away from fossil fuels and nuclear to a future of renewables. Switching to renewable energy and cutting energy waste is our best hope of affordable fuel bills in the future. If you feel strongly about this issue then Friends of the Earth suggest you: email Energy Secretary Ed Davey now and ask him to switch the UK's power supply to renewable energy. make a personal commitment to cleaning up British energy by switching your own energy to a green supplier.

On the eve of a damning judgment by the Green Alliance on the Tories' record in government, Conservatives alarmed by the threat of climate change are pledging that they will not be \"rolled over\" by sceptics. But the green Tories acknowledge that as they move on from the era when David Cameron rode with huskies on a visit to a Norwegian glacier in 2006, they need to recalibrate their message to respond to consumers struggling with rising energy bills. \"People don't want the green economy to live in a bubble,\" one source said. A first step in the fightback is being taken by Greg Barker, the climate change minister, who writes in a Guardian article that the government will help drive down energy costs by prising open the energy market to challenge the \"big six\" suppliers. \"The big six need to become the big 60,000,\" Barker writes. \"This is a vision that happily unites the drive to get a better deal for hard-pressed consumers with ambitions for a greener, more local energy sector. To achieve this we need a new generation of energy entrepreneurs and disruptive, local new entrants.\" But signalling new sensitivities among green Tories, Barker says alternative technologies such as offshore wind and new nuclear power stations are important but \"not the entire recipe\". The minister says environmentalists should stop seeing gas as the \"bogeyman\" and should instead focus on unabated coal. \"There is a lesson here for the environmental lobby. Gas is not a bogeyman. If used to the highest environmental standards, gas can be our ally,\" he writes. \"If we are to scale up distributed energy and, crucially, at a time of a rising cost of living, ensure that energy bills are affordable, over the medium term in a way that is compatible with our climate targets, we will need more gas not less. Unabated coal should be the committed environmentalist's number one target, not the cleanest and most efficient of fossil fuels.\" George Osborne raised questions about the Tories' commitment to the green agenda in his speech to the party's 2011 conference when he said the planet would not be saved by putting Britain \"out of business\". The chancellor announced that Britain would cut its carbon emissions \"no slower but also no faster\" than other EU countries. The Tory green campaigners believe their plans should please Osborne because they fit with the party's traditions. They want to deregulate the energy market, in contrast to Labour which would, according to Barker, regulate the market even further. Barker writes: \"Conservatives are forging an agenda to encourage competition, innovation and greater consumer choice by attracting new entrants into the market, banking on more competition, diversity and choice to deliver a better deal for consumers.\" But the campaigners are prepared to confront some figures in the party who used the Osborne speech to dismiss the need for action on climate change. They highlight an article by Tim Montgomerie, founding editor of the ConservativeHome website who is now comment editor of the Times, who called for the repeal of green energy laws. Montgomerie wrote in July that he did not deny that the climate may be changing. But he added: \"Britain's statute book is still creaking under the weight of yesteryear's laws and their commitments to invest in expensive green energies. Until those laws are repealed, British businesses and consumers will be paying a very high price for no earthly benefit.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/25/europe-divided-nuclear-power-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-25T18:41:08Z","webTitle":"Europe divided over nuclear power after Fukushima disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/25/europe-divided-nuclear-power-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/25/europe-divided-nuclear-power-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Europe divided over nuclear power after Fukushima disaster","bodyText":"Europe's nuclear power faultlines in the wake of the Fukushima disaster were exposed on Wednesday as Switzerland moved to phase out its nuclear power plants and the extent of British and French lobbying to water down nuclear safety checks was revealed. The UK, with the backing of France and the Czech Republic, managed to have terror attacks excluded from a series of new nuclear safety tests ordered after the Japanese tsunami led to radiation leaks from Fukushima nuclear reactors in March. The Swiss cabinet called for the decommissioning of the country's five nuclear power reactors and new energy sources to replace them. The recommendation will be debated in the country's parliament, with a decision expected in June that could see the reactors go offline between 2019 and 2034. European regulators struck a deal on \"stress tests\" of how the EU's 143 nuclear power plants would withstand natural disasters, but terror attacks were reportedly excluded because of the UK argument that they lie within the purview of national security authorities and not the European commission or national nuclear regulators. \"The reason why we excluded terrorism from the tests was mainly, although not 100%, down to UK resistance,\" an EU official said. \"The UK authorities argued that there was a difference between safety and security.\" The anti-nuclear green pressure group Greenpeace also accused the UK of leading the opposition to including terror attacks in the safety test simulation criteria. Europe's divisions over nuclear power have deepened since Fukushima, with Britain and France remaining steadfast supporters, Italy shelving plans to build new plants and Germany taking steps towards a phase-out. Plants must now prove they can withstand worse earthquakes and other natural disasters than in the past, such as a quake of magnitude 8 instead of 6, although the precise definition of \"higher safety margin\" will be left up to national regulators. \"One of the most important lessons to be drawn is that the unthinkable can happen – that two natural disasters can hit at the same time,\" the commission said, announcing the agreement. But manmade disasters proved to be the sticking point. Scenarios such as aeroplane crashes and explosions near a plant such as from a gas container or oil tanker will be included in the stress test criteria, but, in a victory for London, the question of terror attacks is to be dealt with separately, by anti-terrorism experts and national security officials. One UK source said: \"We've always said that assessment of safety and risk is fine, but security questions should remain the preserve of national security experts. I don't think this counts as watering down the criteria at all.\" The tests, to begin on 1 June, require plant operators to answer a questionnaire on the various scenarios, supported by engineering studies. National regulators will assess whether their reports are credible, and they will be subject to a peer review process by seven-member teams from the European Nuclear Safety Regulators' Group. The commission does not have the legal power to shut down nuclear plants and is depending on citizen pressure once the results are published by the end of April 2012."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-post-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-03T15:07:40Z","webTitle":"Japanese energy policy stands at a crossroads | Comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-post-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-post-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Japanese energy policy stands at a crossroads","bodyText":"Japan will close its last nuclear power plant on Saturday, at least temporarily. Before the Fukushima disaster in 2011, there were 54 reactors providing one-third of the country's electricity. The unprecedented speed and extent of Japan's current denuclearisation offers an important lesson: society is a powerful force for implementing policies it supports, but also for blocking unwanted policies. What stands out when comparing the response of the UK, Germany and Japan to Fukushima is Germany's responsive governance, which translates its citizens' concerns into opportunities for Germany PLC. The opposite is the case in Britain, where governance tends to strangle innovation and continues to push an increasingly untenable nuclear strategy, despite the preference for renewable energy of most of its citizens. Japan itself is at an energy crossroads. Over the past 14 months, Japan's reactors have been closed one-by-one after routine refuelling and maintenance checks. This has occurred partly because new safety tests put in place since Fukishima have neither been agreed nor approved, but also because local opposition means the consent of local government can no longer be assured. Japanese policy is now stuck between public opinion, which is increasingly opposed to nuclear power, and the energy industry, which remains in the hands of the large centralised utilities who want a continued role for nuclear power. Unsurprisingly, the loss of one-third of electricity generation in Japan is leading to massive changes in energy supply and demand, including the weekend and night operation of factories to spread the electricity load, much less use of air conditioning and the greater use of fossil fuel plants. The efficiency measures are delivering major changes in the targeted areas, such as in Tokyo, with reductions of 18% in peak demand in August and the actions of people at home leading to an 17% reduction in consumption. Japan also installed 1,000MW of solar photovoltaics in 2011 and is introducing new legislation to double the use of renewables and introduce German-style feed-in tariffs. Analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggests that 20GW of solar and wind could be in place by 2014. So one upside of the tragedy is a much greater public engagement with their energy use – something which seems to be a central but elusive requirement in achieving a successful energy transformation. Another implication is that for the first time, Japanese consumers are making their energy views known. It is unclear whether, even if it wanted to, the Japanese government could restart a supportive post-Fukishima nuclear policy. The response to the Fukushima disaster by Germany and Britain were starkly different from each other. Germany permanently closed eight reactors in the summer of 2011, with the gradual phase out of the rest expected by 2022. This was adopted by all major parties – the only party who objected thought 2022 was too slow – giving political stability and consensus. Critics who argued that carbon dioxide emissions would rise, that Germany would have to import electricity, and that there would be a negative impact on energy prices have been proven wrong. Germany remains a net electricity exporter and CO2 fell by 2.4% in 2011, with public opinion remaining supportive of the phase-out. However, it is the decision to turn the nuclear phase-out into an opportunity for German manufacturing and employment which is so bold. This includes a significant increase in renewable energy deployment: 35% of electricity by 2020 and 50% by 2030, as well as significant new investment in energy efficiency, infrastructure and energy storage systems and the construction of highly efficient fossil fuel plants. This represents a national response of far greater depth and breadth than a narrow decision to support nuclear power or not. It reflects a country commitment to staying at the forefront of technological development and innovation. This requires flexibility not just in technology use and in valuing the wider benefits technology can bring to society, but also in its governance process which enables a quick but legitimate policy response. On the other hand, the British government response to Fukushima incident was a rapid public reassurance that no such nuclear accident could occur in Britain, followed by a statement of support for its ongoing policy to build a new generation of nuclear power plants, now stuttering as companies cancel their planned reactors. What are the lessons which can be extracted from these three separate histories? One obviously is that if there is political consensus and will, incredible and rapid change can occur to a country's energy system which can not only be environmentally, but also financially, beneficial. Germany has built, step by step, an integrated but pragmatic energy system. It has transformed support for domestic renewable energy into a long-term strategic goal of society, avoiding destructive opposition along the way. One aspect of this has been to stop incumbent energy companies from controlling the development of the energy system, although it has allowed them to benefit from those changes. It has fused citizen aspirations for the long-term goal of society with legitimacy and technology policy, thereby enabling it to harness post-Fukishima opportunities. Britain on the other hand has focussed on short-term economic, technology options that are beneficial to incumbent companies, with minimal consideration of societal or consumer concerns for either the short or long term. This means it neither has the imagination nor the ability to be opportunistic for the benefit of Britain. Back to Japan and its crossroads. Its response to the 1970s oil shock was both technology-led and centralised through a world-leading programme of industrial energy efficiency and solar panel development, and the development of a huge nuclear sector. Today's energy crisis offers new challenges and new solutions. On the one hand technology must play a fundamental role and once again Japan can be on the forefront of research, development and deployment. However, the new energy future will also require much greater societal support and involvement – which is what Japan now has as a result of Fukushima. Working with this, rather than against it, could well be the opportunity needed to deliver a secure energy future. • Catherine Mitchell is professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter.

Every day brings a new Israeli warning that the situation is intolerable and that they will attack Iran's nuclear sites if nothing is done. These warnings have been met with obfuscation and bluster by Iran, as the two states have ratcheted up their shadow war of assumed assassinations against each other around the globe. The actual evidence behind the Iranian threat is murkier than many realize: Friday's IAEA report suggested that there are many outstanding questions about Iran's uranium enrichment program, but US intelligence agencies remain unconvinced that Iran has an active program to convert that material into a bomb. But much like Iraq, the debate over the actual facts has been sidelined by one over the wisdom of striking first before the threat manifests itself. But an Israeli attack on Iran would be neither as clean nor effective as its proponents suggest. And the events that unfold afterwards are likely to be a strategic disaster for Israel and the United States. Proponents of an Israeli attacks against Iran's nuclear facilities have described it as a surgical strike that would destroy or seriously damage the Iranian nuclear program without significant \"collateral damage\". The clear precedent for such a strike would be the Israeli airstrike on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981, which destroyed a nuclear reactor and set back Iraq's nuclear weapons program by several years. That attack was conducted in a few hours, with a relatively small number of planes, at the cost of 11 casualties. More crucially, it was conducted without an Iraqi military response, and the international outcry was relatively muted. A similar successful strike against an apparent Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 appears to have created a presumption among some Israeli leaders that surprise air strikes can so stun and disable their target that no serious military response will be attempted. While these assumptions have set the stage for the debate over an Israeli strike on Iran, there is no reason to believe that a replay of these events is likely in this instance. In contrast to the small numbers involved in the Osirak strike, American defense officials have estimated that Israel would need to use at least 100 planes and would have to fly a relatively complicated route, most likely across Iraqi airspace, to conduct an attack on Iranian facilities. Given Iran's capabilities and the prospect of retaliation during and after the strike, Israel is unlikely to focus exclusively on destroying the dispersed and often protected nuclear facilities, but will probably extend its target list to include radars and other air defenses, as well as much of Iran's air force, its command and control structure, and some key facilities for elite military units (such as the Quds force). Israel is also unlikely to take unnecessary risks with retaliation against its civilians and may try to destroy any conventional missile capacity that Iran retains with additional air strikes or covert operations. Such an extensive military operation – involving dozens of attacks and an attempt to destroy a hostile neighbor's air force in a sudden attack – bears less of a resemblance to the Osirak strike than it does to the first operations of the Six Day War in 1967. The strategic consequences of such a massive strike against Iran are serious. There is a real danger that such an attack creates an escalatory spiral of conventional strikes which rapidly gets out of hand. Assuming that the air strikes did not destroy all of Iran's capacity for launching missiles, Tehran could launch limited conventional strikes against Israeli cities, which would put pressure on the Netanyahu government to respond in kind or to escalate to punish Tehran. If this occurs, one of the key assumptions of Israel's plan – the attack will be clean and surgical and not kill a large numbers of civilians – comes into doubt. At least publicly, Israel has estimated that it may have to \"absorb\" 500 casualties in the war, while Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said that \"there won't be 100,000 dead, not 10,000 dead, nor 1,000 dead.\" But these calculations are based on a weak or incompetent Iranian response, and assume – perhaps incorrectly – that Israel's current domestic preparedness will mitigate the effects of Iranian counterstrikes. Also, these estimates do not take into account the fact that the human cost of war can radically change the calculations of governments. If Israel bears significant civilian casualties in an Iranian counterstrike, what limits will the Netanyahu government observe in response? How will the extent of Iranian casualties change the calculus in Tehran? If hundreds or thousands of Iranians are left dead, does Iran's increasingly desperate government try to draw Israel into a messy war of tit-for-tat missile strikes over weeks, rather than days, in the hopes of imposing such political and human costs that Israel gives up? One of the most alarming aspects of the current debate over a strike on Iran is the extent to which Israeli leaders appear to have discounted this possibility. According to journalist David Ignatius, some Israel leaders have imagined that this operation will probably be a \"short war\" scenario, where five days of strikes are followed by a UN-sponsored cease-fire. But Israeli leaders made a similar calculation when they attacked Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon in 2006 – and that war dragged on for 33 days, with a much higher Israeli and Lebanese death toll than originally envisioned (pdf). Wars rarely follow the scripts or timelines that leaders set out for them. It's hard to believe that Iran – given weeks of notice of impending strike by Israel – would play along with the script that Israeli leaders have laid out. Similarly, there is no reason to assume that Iran will respond in the same stunned way that Iraq and Syria did after Israeli's strikes on their facilities. Iran's well-publicized and extensive nuclear program – currently, the subject of intense international scrutiny and a matter of national pride – is of a different nature than the secretive and singular programs held by Iraq and Syria. At the time of the Israeli attack, neither Iraq nor Syria had made their nuclear programs the public centerpiece of their foreign policy. But Iran has done so, and it has proven willing to bear crippling sanctions and international condemnation to sustain its nuclear ambitions. While Iraq and Syria were willing to take the punch and not fire back, it is hard to imagine Iran doing the same – given how much it has invested politically in nuclear power. Iran's government, already paranoid and facing widespread domestic discontent, may also calculate that it could not afford to let such an affront stand without some kind of military response. The domestic pressure to respond from a furious population could even back Tehran into a corner where some kind of violent response is necessary, rather than optional. It is also probably not lost on the Iranian leadership that striking back against Israel has political benefits in producing a \"rally around the flag\" effect and that such a show of defiance may even extend its shelf life. Assuming that Iran was incapable of a conventional response, Iran has a series of other options, through its proxies, to respond to Israel. Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli civilian targets are possible, though not guaranteed, as Hezbollah may be wary of inviting an Israeli military response just for the sake of defending its foreign patron. Hamas may also be willing to join the fray and launch rocket attacks or suicide bombers against Israel. In addition, Israeli intelligence has estimated that Iran has as many as 40 sleeper cells around the world, which could launch attacks against Israeli targets, such as embassies. There is no guarantee that these attacks will be limited to the region, as Iran has promised to extend its retaliation to any country that might allow bases to be used for an Israeli strike. Iran could also decide to activate its dense networks of intelligence operatives in Iraq and Afghanistan and attack US personnel or facilities in both countries. The Iranian government has also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in order to drive world oil prices even higher, a decision that might precipitate a confrontation with US naval vessels determined to keep the shipping lanes open. Israeli officials have concluded that these nightmare scenarios are highly unlikely, and that Iranian promises of retaliation are bluffs designed to weaken support for a military Israeli action. They may be right, and much of this may never come to pass. But again, miscalculation is important here: if Israel is wrong about even one of these potential retaliatory options, there is a risk of a long and messy conflict that spreads beyond borders. Moreover, what happens the day after an attack matters a lot. It is not hard to imagine that Hezbollah attacks on Israel would precipitate a limited Israeli military operation against its forces in Lebanon or that Iranian strikes against American embassies or targets abroad may push the US into responding militarily to Iranian provocation. Former chief of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, may be wrong that such a strike will lead to a full-fledged regional war, but there are a lot of terrible options short of that that could come to pass if Iran retains even one of its retaliatory options. Assuming Israel did launch this attack, it is also not clear that it would be effective in stopping the Iranian nuclear program. In the Osirak case, the record is mixed: the air strike did temporarily set back the Iraqi program and bought some time, but Saddam Hussein redoubled his efforts to rebuild his nuclear capabilities throughout the late 1980s, until the program was discovered after the Persian Gulf war. There is some evidence that the strike itself reinforced his determination to get the bomb as an insurance policy against future action by Israel and later the United States. In this respect, there are some similarities with Iran today. Even favorable assessments of an Israeli strike suggest that at best it would set back Iran's program by three to five years. Moreover, an Israeli military operation short of outright regime overthrow is likely to entrench support for a nuclear program among the Iranian political leadership, who will see the race to the bomb as the only way to protect themselves against similar attacks in the future. In other words, an Israeli attack may temporarily set back the program, but hasten Iran's nuclear ambitions in the long term. The final piece of this strategic disaster for Israel is what a strike would do to Israel's regional position. An Israeli strike on Iran may rupture Israel's shaky relationship with Egypt and possibly Jordan. Amid a violent confrontation between Israel and Iran, Syria's crisis may deepen, as the Assad regime may decide to crush the revolt against its rule while the world is distracted by the crisis over Iran. Many of the emerging democracies in the Middle East (such as Tunisia, Iraq and even Libya) could find it harder to establish diplomatic ties with Israel if there is widespread popular outrage over the attack. An Israeli strike on Iran may also stoke new fears in the region, and radically reorient alliances and jeopardize some of the fragile gains of the Arab spring. When the dust has settled after such an attack, Israel may find itself even more isolated, and in a weaker strategic position in the region, than it is today. For the US, this entire scenario presents real strategic costs, as well. If the US backs Israel but does not participate directly in the operation, it will also find itself increasingly isolated as Russia, China and some European governments will move to condemn the attack and to accuse Israel of destabilizing the Middle East. If the crisis lasts longer than the few days envisioned by Israeli officials or causes substantial civilian casualties on either side, ongoing US political support for Israeli operations could lead to the kind of rifts between the US and Europe not seen since the Iraq war. There is also a distinct possibility that the spillover effects of such an attack may make the growing violence in Afghanistan worse, if Iran decides to escalate its campaign of subversion and launch or sponsor fresh attacks against US soldiers. Even silence by the US over an Israeli strike would be interpreted as a green light by much of the Middle East, and the US would bear some of the blame – and cost – for Israel's strategic miscalculation, even if it was never informed or consulted beforehand. Given the costs of the scenarios laid out above, it is clear that the US needs to tell Israel to allow the diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions against Iran to run their course. Many American politicians are fond of saying that they are firm friends of Israel and strongly support its security. But in this case, being a friend of Israel's does not mean marching in lockstep with them towards a strategic disaster. A true friend of Israel speaks the truth, no matter how unpleasant, in order to stop it from talking itself into a false choice and making a grave mistake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/aug/20/fukushima-leak-nuclear-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T10:46:28Z","webTitle":"Fukushima operator reveals leak of 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/fukushima-leak-nuclear-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/aug/20/fukushima-leak-nuclear-pacific","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima operator reveals leak of 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water","bodyText":"Frantic efforts to contain radioactive leaks at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been dealt another blow after its operator said about 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water had seeped out of a storage tank at the site. The leak is the worst such incident since the March 2011 meltdown and is separate from the contaminated water leaks, also of about 300 tonnes a day, reported recently. Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said it did not know how the water leaked out or where it had leaked to, but it believed that the spillage had not flowed into the Pacific ocean. Tepco's spokesman, Masayuki Ono, said the water had seeped into the ground after breaching a concrete and sandbag barrier around the tank. Workers were pumping out the puddle and removing the remaining water from the tank, he added. Despite efforts to contain the spillage, the leak is already the most severe since the crisis began. News of the leak, which was discovered on Monday morning, comes after Tepco admitted that up to 300 tonnes of highly contaminated water from the site was seeping into the sea every day. Government officials said they could not rule out the possibility that the site had been leaking radioactive matter since the plant suffered a triple meltdown on 11 March 2011. An official from Japan's nuclear regulation authority said: \"We have instructed Tepco to find the source of contaminated water – from which tank the water is leaking – and to seal the leakage point. \"We have also instructed them to retrieve contaminated soil to avoid a further expansion of toxic water, and to strengthen monitoring of the surrounding environment.\" The authority classified the latest leak as a level one incident on the International Atomic Energy Authority's scale of nuclear and radiological accidents. The level is the second lowest on the scale. The 2011 meltdowns in three of Fukushima Daiichi's six reactors – caused when the plant was struck by a powerful tsunami that had been triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan's north-east coast – were given the highest severity rating of seven, the same level given to the Chernobyl disaster 25 years earlier. It is the first time Japan's nuclear regulator has deemed an incident serious enough to warrant an international classification since the country's triple disaster almost two and a half years ago. Tepco, which faces renewed criticism over its handling of the water leaks, has admitted that water in a puddle that had formed near the steel storage tank was emitting a radiation dose of 100 millisieverts an hour – five times the annual exposure limit for nuclear plant workers in Japan. Hundreds of tanks have been built at the site to store contaminated water that is being fed into reactor buildings to cool melted fuel rods, as well as underground water running into reactor and turbine basements.Tepco suspects that the water may have leaked through a drain valve connected to a gutter around the tank, which is located about 500 metres from the shore. Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, recently suggested he had lost faith in Tepco's ability to handle the water crisis without government help. The firm's failure to prevent leaks could frustrate his attempts to relaunch further reactors in Japan. The leaks are also causing concern abroad. On Tuesday, South Korea said it had asked Japanese officials to explain the leaks of contaminated water into the Pacific."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2013/oct/18/energy-consumer-affairs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-18T19:57:40Z","webTitle":"Ed Davey urges big six energy firms to come clean on size of their profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/18/energy-consumer-affairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2013/oct/18/energy-consumer-affairs","fields":{"headline":"Ed Davey urges big six energy firms to come clean on size of their profits","bodyText":"The energy secretary, Ed Davey, called on electricity and gas suppliers to act rapidly to reveal their true profitability to customers and the energy regulator, as the government spent another day on the defensive over soaring bills. Davey's aides urged Ofgem to complete a review of the industry's profitability and explain how it managed to produce its estimates of the cost of government green levies. He said: \"We need more transparency from the big six.\" He argued that companies such as Centrica, which owns British Gas, \"need to be held to account for the profits they make and they need to declare them in a much clearer way\". Davey has singled out British Gas, saying his department estimates that ECO – the energy company obligation, money used to help insulate homes – makes up £47 of the average annual energy bill. But when British Gas announced a 10% price increase on Thursday, it put £40 of that rise down to ECO, a calculation not accepted by the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change. On Monday, ministers will hope to move the debate away from energy prices. Davey will announce the crucial contract that paves the way for the first nuclear power plant to be built in a generation, by unveiling the \"strike price\" at which a consortium led by France's EDF will be able to sell the electricity generated at the new Hinkley Point to the national grid. Sources say the two sides are inching close to an agreement based on a figure of about £90–£92 per megawatt hour – a floor that would be almost twice the present wholesale price of electricity. The new nuclear energy programme is at least five years behind schedule and the new Hinkley plant will not be feeding into the grid until 2020. In a sign of how toxic the issue of energy bills is becoming for the Cameron government, the Scottish National party, at its last conference before the referendum on independence, promised cheaper energy bills if Scotland votes to break away. The SNP deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said an independent Scottish government would cut energy bills by 5%, remove levies for tackling fuel poverty and improving energy efficiency from people's bills, and instead fund the scheme directly. The money an independent Scotland would receive from the European Union's emission trading scheme would at least partly cover the cost of it, according to the SNP. The party clearly hopes the promise could be a game-changer in the debate over independence in the same way that a similar promise by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, appears to have had resonance on the English political stage. Coalition ministers freely admit they do not even know if, or by how much, the remaining energy companies such as EDF are likely to raise bills this winter. Only two – SSE and British Gas – have so far announced winter price rises, leaving Downing Street braced for further waves of bad news in the weeks ahead. The energy firms have no legal duty to inform the government in advance, although in practice Davey has so far been given overnight market-sensitive warnings. One source at the Department of Energy likened it politically to waiting week after week for bank bonus figures. But despite the prevailing environment, No 10, following a political agreement across the coalition, has decided not to try to match Miliband's call for a 20-month price freeze. That decision leaves ministers only able to urge customers to shop around for cheaper prices. In a sign of the sensitivity of energy prices, Downing Street was reluctantly drawn into a row over whether people should wear jumpers to reduce their energy bills. The prime minister's spokesman said it was something people should consider if charities advised it was a good move, a day after Davey told Newsnight he wore jumpers at home to keep bills down. But No 10 later had to backtrack, saying: \"The prime minister would point people to a range of things being done to help people with their fuel bills, such as legislating to put everyone on the best tariff for them. He believes Labour's 'price-freeze' policy is a con, and certainly would not advise people on what they should wear.\" Miliband nevertheless seized on the remarks, saying: \"Their crime policy used to be: hug a hoodie. Now their energy policy appears to be: wear a hoodie. Never let the government tell you that there's nothing they can do, or that it's your responsibility to sort out the problems in our energy market.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2013/feb/11/hugh-muir-diary-sarah-teather","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-11T23:50:01Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary: more flip-flops than a shoe shop.

The Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans is now master of all he surveys, but there was a time when even he felt obliged to make a good impression. He arrived with shirt and tie for an interview at the then BBC Greater London Radio. Broadcaster Matthew Bannister, then the station head, was in the chair. But as Bannister told an audience at Northampton university, the tie Evans sported seemed strangely familiar. When challenged, Evans admitted he had indeed borrowed it from the person interviewed shortly before him, having met his rival applicant in the waiting room.

A senior BBC suit had to intervene and ask whether he might be allowed to do it all over again. Such understanding is never shown to mere mortals. But as Snoddy told the same Northampton university audience, studio was re-convened and the interview was re-taped for public consumption. Peter Horrocks, then head of the BBC newsroom, now director, global news, was much better second time around. • Time now for Thought for the Day, with Rt Rev Nick Baines, bishop of Bradford. \"How can there possibly be any objection to eating one animal rather than another?\" blogs Nick. \"Whenever I find myself in central Asia, we eat nothing but horse.

On the Marr show on Sunday George Osborne said: I’ve always been someone who thought it’s not a weakness to listen to good arguments. That was a euphemistic way of saying, ‘When I’m wrong, I’ll admit it.’ And today George Osborne performed the biggest U-turn we’ve seen from the Treasury since Alistair Darling had to find £2.7bn to compensate those losing out from Gordon Brown’s abolition of the 10p rate of tax. To his credit, there was no weaselling, or fudging, or pretending “circumstances had changed”; Osborne just accepted the tax credit cuts were a non-starter and chucked them overboard. (Rupert Harrison, his former chief of staff, says that Osborne is a great believer in accepting when you’re going to lose – see 1.02pm.) In what is being dubbed as another U-turn, Osborne has also shelved the proposed police cuts. The whole performance has been funded by a surprise £27bn fiscal windfall, although Osborne is also raising taxes, principally on big business which will have to find almost £3bn a year from 2017 to pay an apprenticeship levy. Tory MPs seemed delighted. By rights, it should have been a bit of a humiliation (not least because Osborne will have to go to the Commons to seek permission to breach his own welfare cap) but Conservatives seem happy to forgive him for extricating himself from a mess that they were applauding when he created in his summer budget. It just goes to show that sometimes politicians have a memory span that would shame a goldfish. More seriously, it illustrates how ministers with authority can get away with almost anything. And political figures without authority … well, just ask John McDonnell. In other circumstances his Mao’s Little Red Book gag might have worked, but if you are a shadow chancellor trying to shake off assertions that you are a far-left obsessive, quoting Mao in the Commons chamber is probably not a wise idea. Earlier I said it did not matter much because no one ever paid any attention to the shadow chancellor’s response. Sorry, that was wrong; on this occasion they will. That’s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments. He doesn’t really need the money, but George Osborne could consider picking up a lottery ticket or two on the way home tonight - as he’s clearly on a lucky streak. The Office for Budget Responsibility got the chancellor out of a sticky spot tonight, with a surprisingly upbeat view of the economy and unexpected changes to its modelling; which worked out in Osborne’s favour. They also caught out those of us who, ahem, thought this year’s deficit target was in doubt #meaculpa The OBR’s upward revisions are good news - there’s an extra £27bn of revenue to tap into. The big picture hasn’t changed - growth will only be around trend levels over the next five years, and the national debt will reach a hefty £1.7 trillion by the time the books are balanced. But there are significant differences between the measures announced today, and those implemented in the last parliament. Osborne 2.0 is taking a different approach than the original version. As this chart shows, the consolidation in this parliament relies more on welfare cuts and tax receipts, and less on spending cuts (despite the swingeing measures outlined today) And the government has also lifted and smoothed the path of current spending; it’s no longer planning the severe squeeze outlined in March’s budget: The City has taken today’s statements in its stride. Housebuilding shares jumped by around 3%, on the back of the plan to boost home construction. But the pound is calm tonight at $1.512 to the US dollar, and borrowing costs (yields on UK gilts) are little changed. Two sectors of the UK economy are griping tonight. The first - buy-to let and second-home owners - may not get masses of sympathy over the stamp duty hike. It’s not clear how those changes will pan out; it could make buy-to-let much less attractive, and push down house prices. Or landlords could squeeze renters with higher bills. Business leaders are also grinding their teeth, as they wonder how they’ll find £11bn to cover the Apprenticeship Levy to fund 3 million trainee workers from 2017. Obvious targets include squeezing wages, cutting back on investment, and trimming dividends. They would all be counter-productive for growth. And spare a thought for students, hit with funding cuts and the prospect of paying back their loans sooner (once they find a job) Ultimately, even Lucky George can only do so much -- Britain is still vulnerable to global forces, and a Chinese “hard landing”, or severe geopolitical upheaval, could knock the OBR’s forecasts offline. The Resolution Foundation has led the way in campaigning against the tax credit cuts originally planned by Osborne. Here is the verdict on today’s autumn statement from Torsten Bell, its director. On tax credits it is very welcome that the vast majority of families will not see losses next April. The chancellor has done the right thing by reversing these tax credit cuts entirely, rather than fudging the issue. However Universal Credit is the big loser because the cuts to it have not been reversed. Millions of low-income working families are still set to be significantly worse off by the end of the parliament if the Universal Credit roll-out goes ahead as planned. Pain tomorrow is better than pain today – but it is still pain.” The Chancellor has toned down his plans to shrink the state. But we will still see large cuts that radically change what that state does. By the end of the parliament, the state will be focused on delivering healthcare and paying pensions, but will do much less to support young people or those on low-incomes. And here is the Resolution Foundation’s full briefing on the autumn statement. The chancellor proclaimed in the autumn statement that the big rail electrification projects that were put on hold in the summer, the Midland mainline and TransPennine route, would now go ahead. The suspension of the schemes had threatened to undermine the “Northern Powerhouse” plan”. But they will still be finished late - and the money will mainly be raised by selling off railway land, and an extra £700m will be borrowed, adding to Network Rail’s £38.5bn debt. A review by Network Rail’s chairman Peter Hendy has now confirmed that the majority of the five-year plan can now go ahead with additional investment but found that the original plan was “unrealistic and undeliverable”. Depots, shop space at station and the land under railway arches is all expected to be sold off, to help plug the funding gap after massive cost overruns on electrification work. Hendy said no project would now be cancelled and the bulk of the work would be delivered by March 2019. He said “Some projects will cost more and take longer than originally expected but we will see the job through to deliver better journeys for passengers. My review has clearly found that the original plan was unrealistic and undeliverable.” A separate review by Dame Colette Bowe into the embarrassing Network Rail fiasco has also been slipped quietly out today. Earlier Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said police spending was only being protected in cash terms, not in real terms. See 2.59am. But the Treasury says that is not true. The autumn statement document says: The government will protect overall police spending in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019-20. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has just given an interview to Sky News. He said that Labour had three goals in its campaigning ahead of the autumn statement: to stop the tax credit cuts; to protect police budgets; and to get more money for social care. On the first two at least Labour has been largely successful. But he stressed that the devil was in the detail. Labour thought that families could still be losing out by up to £3bn, he said. Asked if his Little Red Book stunt was a mistake, he said it wasn’t. He was just making a point about how Osborne was opposed to the British government nationalising services while quite happy to let state-run Chinese enterprises operate in this country. He was not holding Mao up as a role model, he said. Conservative MPs have given the chancellor a thumping good welcome over at Westminster: (Desk-banging is a traditional sign of approval at the 1922 committee - the weekly gathering of Tory backbenchers). Mind you, those desks got a good banging back in July (when Osborne announced the tax credit cuts abandoned today), so the ‘22 aren’t infallible. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has not given any TV interviews yet about the autumn statement. His Labour colleagues are having to field questions about his Little Red Book stunt, and the general view seems to be that he would have been better off leaving that joke on the cutting room floor. Here’s a line from Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary. Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, has told BBC that it would be wrong to see the tax credits concession as a U-turn. That is because, as tax credits get phased out and claimants move over to universal credit, the new, less generous benefit regime will come into force anyway. Ben Richards, a researcher for the SMF thinktank, has explained more in a briefing from the SMF. He said: The chancellor performed a major U-turn on tax credits by cancelling the reforms altogether. Instead tax credit claimants will only be affected by the freeze in benefits over the next four years, rather than a cash-terms cut. However, cuts to Universal Credit will remain, and will mean that new Universal Credit claimants are likely to face much more meagre levels of support than those claiming tax credits. In the long run this will mean that the Chancellor’s tax credit cuts in effect are implemented anyway. In the short run, however, it will create a number of issues for claimants, and will make the task of communicating the benefits of Universal Credit an uphill struggle for the Government. First, there are likely to be large inequities between different areas, with areas that have already implemented Universal Credit offering much lower support. In 2016-17 for instance, a one-earner couple with two children would take home nearly £800 more if living in an area using the tax credit system, compared to an area using Universal Credit, if working full-time earning the minimum wage. This could create perceptions of regional unfairness. Second, tax credit claimants have a big incentive not to change their circumstances in areas in which Universal Credit is being rolled out. Since new claimants, and claimants with changed circumstances, are likely to be enrolled in Universal Credit, those already receiving tax credits would do well to stay on them by keeping their circumstances unchanged. This could mean refusing to take on more work, or refusing a promotion, for fear of being unable to reclaim tax credits at a later date. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Office for Budget Responsibility did George Osborne a big favour today, by adjusting their forecasts so dramatically: Chote’s team have had another look at their forecasts for likely tax revenues. They have done some modelling. And they have concluded that more money is going to come rolling in to HMRC over the next few years than previously envisaged. To be precise, an extra £2.5bn this year, £4.1bn next year, £6.3bn in 2017-18 and £5.4bn in the year after that. With all this lovely lolly flowing in, Osborne could get himself off the hook on tax credits. Provided, of course, that the tax really does come in on forecast. Chote will clearly be top of the chancellor’s Christmas cards list this year, because it has enabled him to execute a U-turn with the minimum of fuss. It has to be said, though, that the OBR’s forecasts have proved wanting in the past. They could easily be wrong again. “Funny-money forecasts”... “ Sheer brazen cheek”.... A “180-degree body swerve.” Just a few highlights from our expert panel’s verdict - read it all here. The OBR is assuming there will be another delay in the roll-out of universal credit. This is from the OBR’s report. We have added our own forecast judgement of a further six-month delay to the managed migration phase of the [universal credit, or UC] rollout. As usual, we have considered evidence from DWP and the latest assessment of UC rollout by the Major Projects Authority. While this indicates greater confidence in the ‘transition phase’ rollout plan, considerable uncertainty remains over the ‘managed migration’ phase. And of course the transition phase rollout schedule has just been pushed back six months, just a year after the previous delay. And this chart hightlights all the delays that have already occurred. (The line on the left shows what was originally meant to happen, and the lines on the right are the most recent forecasts.) Relieved that (most) tax credits aren’t being cut? Or perhaps you work in a public service whose budget is being cut - or a company being hit by the Apprentice’s Levy? Whatever the case, we’d like to hear how the spending review will affect your life: Not all of the tax credit cuts announced in the summer are being abandoned. The Treasury is still going ahead with a cut to the “income rise disregard” - the amount of extra a tax credit claimant can earn before losing benefits. In July Osborne announced that this was being cut from £5,000 to £2,500. That cut still applies, and it raises £170m. Moody’s, which stripped the UK of its AAA credit rating in 2013, has warned that Britain still faces a big fiscal challenge. Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, says: “While the autumn statement does not fundamentally change our overall view on the UK’s public finances, it again underlines the challenges the government faces in reducing the UK’s large budget deficit and doing so predominantly via spending cuts in a relatively small part of government spending.“ “We still believe that the government will manage to gradually improve its public finances and bring the public debt on a declining trend. That said, the OBR now forecasts a deficit of 2.5% of GDP in 2016/17, compared to 2% of GDP just eight months ago. This is partly due to the statistical reclassification of the housing associations into the public sector, but it also reflects higher departmental spending as some of the planned spending cuts, in particular the tax credit cuts, have been withdrawn.” Moody’s isn’t alarmed by those spending changes, though - as it already expected the government to impose its cuts more slowly than planned. Labour insiders are briefing that John McDonnell’s Little Red Book moment was a humorous aside, in case anyone was confused. They may be rattled by that Conservative attack note, outlining Mao’s record. Labour has strongly criticised the decision to cut Short money. (See 3.11pm.) This is from a party spokesman. This is another anti-democratic move by the Tories. Having already attacked the rights of working people they’re now coming forward with partisan moves to hit their opposition and give themselves another unfair advantage. If the Tories were really serious about cutting the cost of politics they would start with the bill for Tory special advisers which has rocketed under David Cameron. Labour says the bill for government special advisers rose by 35% to £8.4m from 2011-12 to 2013-14, the last year for which figures are available. Average earnings have been revised down partly because the OBR thinks that the apprenticeship levy means firms will have less money for pay rises. This is from the OBR’s report. We have revised average earnings growth lower relative to our July forecast. That partly reflects small adjustments to our productivity growth forecast, but also an assumption that the ongoing costs of auto- enrolment and the introduction of an apprenticeship levy will weigh on earnings growth. These are both economically equivalent to payroll taxes, so – consistent with evidence on the incidence of such taxes – we assume that most of the cost will ultimately be borne by employees. Together, auto-enrolment and the new apprenticeship levy reduce cumulative wage growth over the forecast period by 0.7 per cent. This estimate relies on assumptions about how firms respond to such changes, so is subject to considerable uncertainty. And the OBR report also shows that average earnings have been revised downwards for the next five years (by 0.2% in 2016, then 0.2%, then 0.3%, then 0.4%, and then 0.4%). Back at the OBR briefing, Robert Chote has outlined how the government’s Apprentice Levy will drag wages down this decade: According to the OBR, the level of real household disposable income has been revised down for 2015 by 0.5%. That means the OBR thinks we have had less money to spend this year than it previously assumed. We’ve had two U-turns from the government today - on tax credits, and police funding. And now there’s a third. It is not strictly autumn statement-related, but if you’ve got something embarrassing to announce, why now sneak it out when the nation’s journalists are already working flat out on a budget-scale event. “Burying bad news” it used to be called. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has been resisting calls to go to Acas, the conciliation service, for talks to avert the junior doctors’ strike. The BMA and Labour have been pushing for this, but Hunt said he want the BMA to talk to him first. Now, though, the Department of Health has agreed to go to ACAS. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, is absolutely furious that the government is freezing the student loan repayment threshold, and not uprating it in line with earnings. He says: “This is a disgraceful move and a breach of trust by the government that betrays a generation of students. It has chosen to freeze the repayment threshold even though 95% of the consultation responses did not support the freeze - what was the point of a consultation if when there’s huge objection it does it anyway? According to Lewis, the freeze means 2 million graduates will end up paying £306 more each year by 2020-21 than they would have done without the change. (students must repay 9% of everything they earn above £21,000 (pre-tax salary) once they graduate) Lewis also accuses George Osborne of cowardice, for not mentioning the change in his statement: “It is risking fundamentally threatening any trust people have in the student finance system. It is one thing to set up a system that is unpopular but it is entirely different to make retrospective changes that mean you cannot even rely on what you were promised at the time you started to study. Even though it was warned of the huge dangers of doing this, it’s still blundering ahead, ignoring all right thinking concern. “The fact that the Chancellor didn’t even have the balls to put it in his Autumn Statement speech shows that he knew how unpopular it would be. If a commercial company made retrospective changes to their loan terms in this way they’d be slapped hard by the regulator – the Government shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it either. The government has quietly announced that it is hitting students in the pocket, by not raising the threshold for repaying their loans. The BIS department says: To reduce government debt, the student loan repayment threshold for Plan 2 borrowers will be frozen until April 2021. Plan 2 borrowers are those who took out loans from 2012 onwards. Previously, the threshold for repayments was meant to rise in line with earnings. Labour MP Wes Streeting (a former president of the National Union of Students) says it’s a betrayal, given the government consulted about the move: And here is a Guardian video with Osborne’s best jokes. They don’t miss a trick at CCHQ. Someone has been busy with Wikipedia, and the Tories have just sent out a full-page briefing note about the evils of Chairman Mao, including the claim that 45m Chinese died during the famine caused by Great Leap Forward. Here is the John McDonnell moment they are referring to. Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, is briefing the media now: The BBC has taken the unusual step of resorting to Twitter to invite anyone from Labour to appear on the autumn statement programme. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, says they don’t know whether John McDonnell will turn up. George Osborne announced a new top-up stamp duty, 3% above the current rate, for people buying homes for buy to let. Bad news, if you’ve got the money and plan to splash; the new rate will cover all second homes, not just ones that are being let. This new levy will raise £625m next year, rising to £880m by the end of the parliament. According to the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope, unmarried couples will be able to avoid this. The CBI is also concerned that businesses are being squeezed too hard: The Institute for Directors has sounded the alarm about the government’s new Apprentice Levy. This new scheme puts a tax on firms’ payroll — to fund Britain’s apprenticeship system. Simon Walker, Director General of the IoD, isn’t impressed: “The major business tax announcement of this Autumn Statement was the Apprenticeship Levy, which can only be described as a new payroll tax. At 0.5% of payroll it will be a big new cost for many companies, including medium-sized ones. We are very concerned by the Government’s assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy. Firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in, but it’s not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy. As flagged earlier, the Levy is expected to raise more than £11bn. And the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted it will lead to “lower nominal wages and profit margins” -- bad news for workers and shareholders. That’s pretty significant for a major retailer such as Tesco: It is often claimed that we don’t have state funding for political parties in the UK. But we do, on a modest level, because opposition parties get so-called Short money (named after Ted Short, a former leader of the Commons) to fund what they do in parliament. Currently this is worth more than £6m a year to Labour, and more than £1m a year to the SNP. All political parties can also get policy development grants, which add up to another £2m a year in total. This money is now being cut. The Tories will lose a bit through the changes to policy development grant funding, but Labour will be hit the hardest. This is from the autumn statement document. Therefore, subject to confirmation by Parliament, the government proposes to reduce Short Money allocations by 19%, in line with the average savings made from unprotected Whitehall departments over this Spending Review. Allocations will then be frozen in cash terms for the rest of the Parliament, removing the automatic RPI indexation. Policy Development Grant allocations will also be reduced by a similar proportion, ensuring that political parties in receipt of taxpayer-funding contribute to the savings being asked of local and central government. Transport has been dealt the biggest cut of any government department as a proportion of its day-to-day spending, with 37% slashed from the DfT’s resource budget by 2020, reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. Most of the savings will come from London. Transport for London’s operational budget of almost £700m a year will be entirely wiped out by the end of the decade, leaving TfL to fund its services through commercial investment, cuts or potentially higher fares. But the chancellor said that transport cuts would be offset by money earmarked for infrastructure funding, up 50% from the last parliament to £61bn over the next six years, including 2020-21. Much of the later spending will go on HS2 - whose price tag has been officially increased to £55.7bn at 2015 prices. Road building will account for £15bn in spending, which George Osborne hailed as the largest road investment programme since the 1970s. London will still receive a total £11bn to continue upgrades and new infrastructure, including Crossrail. The chancellor said the increased capital budget would ensure that critical rail projects such as the electrification of the Midland mainline and Transpennine route can go ahead, after they were shelved earlier this year to outcry in the north. The DfT forecasts that rail franchising will deliver bigger returns to the Treasury than it currently receives. The DfT’s budget will fall from £2.6bn this year to £1.8bn in 2019-20. Its departmental administration budget will be cut by 12% in real terms, a slightly less severe cut than the 18% average across government. The most startling hit for energy and environment in the spending review is £132m pulled from energy efficiency schemes, announced on the day that a huge leap in winter deaths was revealed, says our environment editor Damian Carrington. Osborne sold the change as a £30 cut to consumer bills, but customers in leaky homes will pay much more in the long run. The chancellor also slashed 40% - £700m - from a scheme backing green heating systems, lowering the chances the UK can hit its climate change targets. Meanwhile, heavy industrial energy users got a £20m exemption from green taxes. But Osborne, known as a technology geek, also announced “at least £250m over the next five years in an ambitious nuclear research and development programme that will revive the UK’s nuclear expertise”. This will include a competition to identify the best value “small modular reactor design” - mini-nuke - for the UK, which Osborne said would pave the way to building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s. The £2bn Osborne announced for flood defences is not new and the £1bn Shale Wealth Fund remains theoretical, as no fracking has yet happened. Both the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have taken heavy cuts to day-to-day spending, meaning job losses. For DECC in particular, this is likely to undermine the government’s ability to get the best value for taxpayers in deals with the private sector, such as subsidies for expensive future nuclear power plants. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, claims the decision to protect police budgets is a win for Labour (which has been campaigning on this.) But he says it is not quite as generous as Osborne implied, because police budgets will be protected in cash terms but not in real (ie, inflation adjusted) terms. UPDATE: The Treasury says that is not true. The autumn statement document says: The government will protect overall police spending in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019-20. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee and who led opposition to the tax credit cuts, is claiming that some families claiming the new universal credit could still lose more than £2,000, the BBC reports. Britain’s fiscal watchdog has admitted that it has underestimating the amount of money brought in through VAT. It has changed the way it models VAT deductions, providing an extra £400m this year - rising to £3.3bn (!) by 2020. The OBR has also changed its modelling for national insurance take, and again, they work out in the government’s favour - with an extra £2.8bn coming in by 2020. Here’s John McDonnell quoting Mao’s Little Red Book. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has just been on the BBC explaining how George Osborne has been able to fund his surprise “good news” announcements. Asked if the sums were credible, Johnson said: [Osborne] has got a bit lucky, in that there are some more tax revenues expected to come in by the OBR. And he’s got a bit lucky because he’s going to be a spending a bit less on debt interest. He has also increased taxes reasonably significantly. There’s a £3bn impost on business to pay for the new apprenticeships. And there are some increases in council tax, probably. And there are some other tax increases there. So he’s done two things. He has taken advantage of increased revenues and reduced spending on debt interest. He’s increased taxes a bit. And he’s essentially used most of that money to damp down the cuts in spending. And because those cuts in spending were on a relatively limited part of government, the effect of that bit of extra money is to significantly reduce the overall level of cuts. The OBR has revised up its forecast for income tax and national insurance contributions this parliament by almost £15bn. That has helped to chancellor to stick to his deficit reduction targets despite raising spending - so there could be problems if they’re wrong... It’s official, the cap doesn’t fit. The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that the government will fall into its welfare cap trap several times. It says: Our central forecast shows that the terms of the welfare cap are set to be breached in three successive years from 2016-17 to 2018-19, with the net effect of policy measures raising welfare cap spending in each of those years, and to well above the 2 per cent forecast margin in 2016-17 and 2017-18. The terms of the cap are set to be observed by very small margins in 2019-20 and 2020-21, with spending above the cap but within the forecast margin and with the net effect of measures in those years reducing spending. The OBR has calculated that today’s measures will raise gross tax take by £28.5bn by 2020. It says: These include the new apprenticeship levy (£11.6 billion), higher council tax (£6.2 billion), and the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty land tax for second homes and buy-to-let purchases (£3.8 billion). That’s a major tax hit on businesses, who are being forced to take on the cost of creating millions of extra apprentices. This chart shows how tax changes (in yellow) will pull down the deficit, while public spending changes (in grey) will push it up (as well the u-turn on tax credits). Today’s detailed forecasting by the OBR has some grim news for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, by warning that income from taxes controlled by the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh are likely to be lower than it thought. Raising fresh questions about the Scottish government’s future finances, the OBR forecasts that tax income from Swinney’s flagship replacement for stamp duty, introduced on new house sales earlier this year, will be 20% lower over the next six years than it predicted in July. The OBR estimates revenues from the new land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) will be £926m lower by 2021, contributing directly to a £485m fall in overall tax receipts for the Scottish government compared to the OBR’s forecast in July. Holyrood will start to take nearly complete control over income tax in Scotland from April 2016 – helping it raise some £6bn a year by 2021. But the OBR now believes that based on current tax rates, Scotland’s income tax receipts will only rise by 0.7% compared to its July forecast. Here is a quick round-up of what political journalists and writers are saying about John McDonnell on Twitter. Mostly they are not complimentary. (The consolation for McDonnell is that it does not really matter. Almost all the media focus today will be on Osborne.) From the Times’s Patrick Kidd From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves From the Guardian’s Rafeal Behr From Sky News’s Faisal Islam From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From the FT’s Jim Pickard From the author Robert Harris From Newsnight’s Allegra Stratton The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that it has raised its forecast for tax receipts, allowing George Osborne to ease back on austerity. In the first combined Spending Review and Autumn Statement since 2007, the Government has taken advantage of an improvement in the outlook for tax receipts – concentrated in the middle years of this Parliament – to further loosen the impending squeeze on public services spending, to increase capital spending and to reverse the main tax credit cuts it announced in July, while still delivering a modestly stronger budget balance in most years on a like-for- like basis. As the boost to receipts begins to ebb, the Government increases departmental spending by less and relies more on tax increases to maintain the bottom line improvement. There is still a major squeeze on departments, though -- Osborne’s latest cuts are roughly than a third smaller on average than those delivered over the last Parliament. But in aggregate, the OBR says the chancellor is actually spending more than he’s getting in from the improved fiscal outlook: Taken together with the other measures in the Autumn Statement, the Government has announced a net fiscal giveaway of £6.2 billion next year, more than half of which is the cost of reversing the tax credit cut. This outweighs a £2.9 billion improvement in the underlying forecast in that year and thereby pushes up the deficit. McDonnell is still speaking. He says this statement was part of Osborne’s leadership bid. The statement will be seen as the apex of Osborne’s career, he says. He describes Osborne as Icarus - flying too close to the sun. He says Labour’s advocates investment instead. It wants high skills, high investment, and high wages. That is what Labour will secure when it returns to office, he says. And that McDonnell response is over. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is responding to George Osborne now. Having to respond to statements of this kind is the hardest task any parliamentarian ever has to undertake (because the opposition gets no advance warning of what is in these statements) and no one ever really triumphs in this role. McDonnell started by taunting Osborne for the fact that he failed completely to cut the deficit in one parliament as he promised in 2010. McDonnell’s argument was sound, although his attempt to lecture the Tories on deficit reduction and economic credibility prompted laughing from the government benches. McDonnell is going through cuts in the announcement now. He says that he Department for Business is almost being closed down, and that the solar energy industry is being killed off. He says he never expected to be outdone in nationalisation by Osborne. He says he, McDonnell, wants to nationalise rail. But Osborne wants to sell British assets to Chinese state companies. McDonnell brandishes a copy of Mao’s Little Red Book, and he quotes from it: “We must learn to do economic work from all, no matter who they are.” He thought this advice would come in handy for Osborne, McDonnell says. He says this is not an economic plan but a political fix. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s new Economic and fiscal outlook is online too. Now we can see the details of today’s figures.... Economic and fiscal outlook – November 2015 The Spending Review and Autumn Statement are online here. John McDonnell has just stood up to respond to George Osborne. He has got quite a task, because there were some genuine political surprises there, as well as at least two leaps into Labourish territory. Quite how Osborne will fund his “good news announcements” is a total mystery, on the basis of what Osborne said, but after a few hours with the red book we should find out. But Osborne does probably deserve some credit for abandoning his tax credits completely, instead for opting for a fudge. If you are going to do a U-turn, you may well do one properly, and Osborne pulled this off with some aplomb. His announcement on police funding was a real surprise too (although we need to see the small print). More interesting were the apprenticeship levy - a £3bn tax on big business, not unlike Gordon Brown’s 1997 windfall tax, and more ambitious than anything Labour proposed at the election - and the punitive 3% stamp duty for buy to let landlords, another move that sounds Jeremy Corbyn than Ed Balls. Here’s Heather Stewart on today’s Autumn Statement: George Osborne has executed a complete U-turn on his controversial cuts to tax credits, as he delivered what he called, “a big spending review from a government that does big things”. Osborne had promised to modify the plans, which would have seen 3m low-income families lose an average of £1,000 a year, after they were rejected by the House of Lords, and criticised by Conservative backbenchers. Delivering his combined autumn statement and spending review, the chancellor said higher than expected tax revenues and lower interest payments on government debt had opened up an extra £27bn of fiscal wriggle-room, which would allow him to cancel the £4.4bn cuts altogether..... You always expect a few white rabbits from George Osborne. But this time, the Office for Budget Responsibility handed the chancellor a plump bunny, with better growth forecasts despite recent signs of weakness in the global economy. And that means the chancellor has wrong footed City economists who expected slightly worse deficit figures today. Low global interest rates have probably cut the bill for servicing the national debt. The OBR must also be more optimistic about tax receipts - despite the surprise fall in October. That adds up to an unexpected windfall for the chancellor, allowing him to stick to that surplus target in this parliament and also avoid cuts to the police. But the axe has still swung elsewhere. The OBR are releasing its latest economic and fiscal forecasts now, so we’ll soon be able to see the details [it’s also complicated by reclassifications to the national debt]. Past history shows that the statement may look less rosy under closer examination.... The spending cuts outlined today mean the chancellor is persevering with a Thatcher-style reshaping of the UK economy, cutting the state: And while the the tax credit u-turn will be welcomed by poorer workers, let’s not forget that pensioners can also look forward to more money - thanks to the ‘triple-lock’. Osborne says the Tories were elected as one nation government. And they are governing as such, he says, as “the mainstream representatives of the working people of Britain”. Osborne says the counter-terrorism budget is going up 30%. Osborne says some people have said police budgets should be cut by 10%. (This is a reference to Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, who said the police could live with cuts of 10%.) But he disagrees, he says. Police budgets will not be cut, Osborne says. Osborne says the police protect us, so we will protect them. Is the party over for buy-to-let landlords? Newsnight’s Duncan Weldon suggests so: Conservative backbencher David Davis (former shadow home secretary) has also given Osborne the thumbs-up: Osborne turns to security. It is in the national interest to spend on aid, he says. Aid budget to rise to £16.3bn by the end of the parliament. The Foreign Office’s budget to be protected. Osborne turns to house building. Some details of his plans emerged overnight. He says he wants to do much more than in the past. Housing budget to be doubled, to £2bn a year. This will fund 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade - affordable to buy, not just to rent. Help to Buy shared ownership will relax the rules around shared ownership, ensuring more people can take advantage. From tonight the tenants of five housing associations will be able to exercise their right to buy. London Help to Buy will allow people in the capital to get a loan to help buy a home. A new stamp duty rate for people buying homes as buy to let will be 3% higher than normal stamp duty. The revenue will be reinvested back in local communities. We are the builders, Osborne says, using the slogan he used in his party conference speech. Osborne says under-used courts will be closed. The £700m saved will be used to introduce new technology into the court service. Nine new prisons to be built. Holloway prison, the biggest women’s prison in Western Europe, will close, he says. The women will serve their time in more modern prisons. Osborne turns to apprenticeships. The apprenticeship levy to raise £3bn a year. It will be set at 0.5% of the payroll bill. But there will be a £15,000 allowance, so 98% of employers will not pay. Part-time students will be able to receive maintenance loans, Osborne says. Osborne says the arbitrary schools funding system will be replaced. He commends MPs from all parties who have campaign for this. New school funding system to come into force from 2017. Nicky Morgan to launch a consultation on the new funding formula next year, he says. Osborne says sixth form colleges will be able to become academies, so they do not have to pay VAT. Councils running schools will become a thing of the past. Schools funding will increase by £10bn. Osborne says free school meals and the pupil premium will be maintained. He says the national citizen service will be expanded. By the end of the decade, there will be places for 300,000 students. Osborne says the government is making the largest ever investment in free childcare. It will be available from 2017. But it will only be available to families working a certain number of hours per week. The Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Owen Smith, warns that low-income households on Universal Credit are still vulnerable: Osborne says sound public finances can help the most disadvantaged. Inequality is down, and child poverty is down, he says. The other side talks of social justice; the Conservatives deliver it, he says. Osborne says this is similar to the way Libor fines are used to help service charities. He names various ones that will benefit from Libor money, including the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. And there will be a memorial for the victims of 7/7. Osborne says there are many charities that support vulnerable women. Some 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for the removal of the tampon tax. The government wants to change EU law so it can abolish that altogether. But, until then, the £15m raised from the tax will go to women’s charities, he says. Osborne says cuts in arts funding are a false economy. The DCMS’s administrative budget will be cut by 20%. But the Arts Council’s budget will be protected, and free museum entry will be maintained. He says Alan Johnson has lobbied him for money for Hull’s year of culture. He will oblige, he says. He says Johnson has contributed to arts, while his front bench has contributed to comedy. Osborne says the Department for Business budget is being cut by 17%. In the last parliament the budget for science was protected in cash terms. In this parliament it will be protected in real terms, he says. The Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge will be transformed. Paul Nurse, a Nobel laureate, has just published a report into research laboratories. Its recommendations will be published. Professor Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University, tells us: “New freedoms have been given to councils to realise income generated through sales of property. Useful, but can only be done once.” Osborne says the small business rate relief scheme is being extended for another year. Osborne says support for climate finance is being increased. A new energy scheme will save £30 a year from the energy bills of 30m households, he says. The rules affecting the compensation culture around minor motor industries are changing. That should cut car insurance, he says. Osborne says Defra’s budget is falling by 15%. But there will be £2bn for flood defences. Mentioning forestry, he says the government will not be making them mistake of trying to privatise them again. And the government will carry on with the scheme that cuts South West Water bills by £50. Osborne says Britain topped the league table of best places in the world to invest in infrastructure spending in a survey last week. Department for Transport spending will be cut by 37%, he says. But its capital spending will go up by around 50%. And London will get an £11bn investment in transport infrastructure. Kent will also get £250m to deal with the problems associated with Operation Stack. Mary Ann Seighart, who chairs the Social Market Foundation, isn’t impressed by Osborne’s plan to allow local councils to sell off surplus properties to fund day-to-day spending: Osborne says he wants a deal for Scotland that is fair and fit to last. If Scotland had voted for independence, it would have its own spending review this autumn. With oil revenues down by around 90%, there would have been catastrophic cuts. But luckily that was avoided, he says. Osborne says Northern Ireland’s block grant will be over £11bn by the end of this parliament. And he says he is giving a funding floor to Wales, set at 115%. And the government will legislate so the Welsh assembly can get powers over income tax without a referendum. Welsh assembly to get powers over income tax without needing a referendum. Osborne says local government is sitting on property worth £250bn. So councils will be able to keep 100% of the receipts from the assets they sell, he says. By the end of this parliament local government will be spending the same in cash terms as it does today. Osborne turns to his northern powerhouse vision, and his plans to devolve power to local authorities. Some 26 new or extended enterprise zones are being created, he says. As he said at the Tory conference, he is abolishing the uniform national business rates. Power over business rates will be devolved. Osborne says the new rate for the basic state pension will be £155.65. Osborne says the basic state pension will increase by £3.35 a week next year, to £119.30 a week. On Twitter Rupert Harrison, Osborne’s former chief of staff, has explained why Osborne abandoned the tax credit cuts. Labour MP Alison McGovern, of Wirral South, credits tax credit campaigners: Osborne turns to social care. He says he is increasing the better care fund, to help the integration of health and social care. By the end of this parliament health and social care spending will have risen, he says. Osborne turns to mental health, and he praises Andrew Mitchell, Norman Lamb and Alastair Campbell for their campaigning on this. Mental health will get an extra £600m. Osborne says Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, says the NHS is being funded appropriately. NHS funding to rise from £101bn this year to £120bn by 2020-21. One of the Conservative rebels over tax credits, Stephen McPartland of Stevenage, has welcomed the decision to abandon the cuts Osborne says the NHS is the first priority of the government, and the British people. Health spending was cut by the Labour administration in Wales. But under the Tories it is rising in England, he says. Osborne says there is currently a cap on the number of student nurses. That cap will be abolished, and student nurses will have to apply for loans. Osborne says day to day spending in government departments is set to fall by an average of 0.8% a year in real terms. The government is still spending £4 trillion over the next five years, he says. Osborne says the cuts are half what they were in the last parliament. Osborne says total managed expenditure - the government’s total spending - will be £756bn this year, rising to £773bn next year, £787bn the year after, £801bn in 2018-19 and £821bn in 2019-20. Osborne says government spending was 45% of GDP in 2010. Now it is just under 40%. But the end of the spending review period it will be down to 36.5%. At that level it is affordable, he says. Osborne turns to tax avoidance measures. The government will build one of the most digitally advanced tax systems in the world. Everyone will have digital tax accounts by the end of this parliament, he says. And that means capital gains tax will have to be paid quickly. The cost of Whitehall administration will be cut by £1.9bn, he says. Osborne turns to the deficit forecast. Deficit forecast to be 3.9% this year, falling to 2.5% in 2016-17, 1.2% in 2017-18, and 0.2% in 2018-19. In 2019-20 there will be a surplus of 0.5%, followed by one of 0.6% the following year. Osborne says he can help with tax credits. People have argued the cuts should be phased in. But the simplest thing is to avoid them altogether. Osborne abandons tax credit cuts. He says they are being phased out anyway when the universal credit comes in. Osborne confirms that this mean the welfare cap will be breached in the early years of the parliament. But it will be met in the later years of the parliament, he says. Osborne says he has cut his borrowing plans by £8bn. And he will be able to achieve a surplus by cutting less, he says. Debt forecast to be 81.7% next year, 79.9% in 2017-18, 77.3% in 2018-19, 74.3% in 2019-20 and 71.3% in 2020-21. Osborne says housing associations have been brought onto the public balance sheet. That statistical change will be backdated to 2008. The OBR has produced new forecasts. Debt was meant to be 83.6% this year, he says. On the new measure, it is 82.5%, he says. Those growth forecasts mean the UK should grow a little faster than expected in the next two years, before slowing towards the end of the decade: 2015: 2.4%, matching the 2.4% predicted in July’s Budget 2016: 2.4%, up from 2.3% 2017: 2.5%, up from 2.4% 2018: 2.4%, matching the Budget forecast 2019: 2.3%, down from 2.4% Osborne says he is still committed to delivering a surplus in 2019-20. The OBR has approved the forecast. Osborne says Labour claims about the government plans have been proved wrong. The OBR says the economy will grow robustly every year, and living standards will rise every year. OBR says 1m jobs will be created over the next five years, Osborne says. Osborne reads out the growth forecast. Growth forecast to be 2.4% this year, 2.4% in 2016, 2.5% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018, and 2.3% in 2019 and 2020. Osborne says the OBR says debts are too high, and the deficit remains. Expectations for world growth and world trade have been revised down. That is why it is important to protect economic security. Osborne is turning to the new OBR forecasts. Since 2010, no economy in the G10 has grown faster than Britain. That growth has not been fuelled by an irresponsible banking boom, he says. The north has grown faster than the south. This will be a recovery for all, he says. The strongest job growth is not just in the capital, but in the Midlands, which is creating jobs three times faster than London and the south east. Osborne says he will extend opportunities for all. This is a big spending review, by a government that does “big things”, he says. Osborne says the £12bn of welfare savings will be delivered in full, “and delivered in a way that helps families as we make the progression to a national living wage”. Osborne says he is committed to a surplus. His plans will deliver that, he says. And he will bring debt down. This year debt will fall, and it will keep falling in every year, he says. Osborne says five years ago the economy was in crisis. As Labour’s letter said, there was no money left. Then the job was to rescue Britain. Now it is to rebuild Britain. Osborne says the spending review (SR) will put security first. Economic and national security provide the foundations for everthing the government wants to support, he says. We are tracking all the key points from the chancellor’s statement here: George Osborne, the chancellor, is just about to start his statement. It should last for almost an hour. This is what Cameron said at the start of PMQs about Chris Martin. Everyone in this House and many people watching at home know from Yes Prime Minister the central role that Bernard, the Prime Minister’s Principal PPS plays in the life of the Prime Minister and of Number 10 Downing Street. Well this morning my Bernard, my Principal Private Secretary died of cancer, Chris Martin was only 42. He was one of the most loyal, hardworking, dedicated public servants that I’ve ever come across. I’ve no idea what his politics were but he would go to the ends of the earth and back again for his Prime Minister, for Number 10, and for the team he worked for. Today we’re leaving the seat in the Officials’ Box where he used to sit empty as a mark of respect to him. We think of his wife Zoe, his family, the wider Number 10 family because it is a bit like a family and we feel we’ve lost someone between a father and a brother to all of us, and whatever happens we will never forget him. Cameron says we will be hearing more about the infrastructure plan soon. In a Guardian article, my colleague Juliette Jowit explains why people should be sceptical about government infrastructure plan announcements. Here’s an extract. Chancellor George Osborne has promised to put people such as Dave at the heart of his spending review on Wednesday, when he will unveil plans to spend £100bn in this parliament on new infrastructure: roads, railways, power stations and smart meters, flood defences and broadband. But there should be widespread suspicion of the pledge. Osborne has published national infrastructure plans every year since 2010. These and the latest plan underpin the chancellor’s central themes: that he is investing to create jobs and wealth, giving his party the right to be trusted by voters with the economy. Analysis of these plans by the Guardian, however, shows these promises are artificially inflated by rising prices, changes to the rules and a host of expensive but still uncertain schemes. In reality, government spending on infrastructure fell in the last parliament. David Cameron began PMQs with the very sad news that his principal private secretary, Chris Martin, died of cancer today. He was just 42. In a moving tribute, the PM compared Chris Martin to ‘Bernard” of Yes Prime Minister, saying he was: One of the most loyal, hard working, dedicated public servants I have ever come across. He would go to “the ends of the earth and back again” for his team, and he’ll never be forgotten, Cameron added. Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute, saying Chris Martin has played a valuable role when Labour was in power too (he served as Press Secretary to both Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.) More tributes are coming in: David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn both paid tribute earlier to Chris Martin, Cameron’s principle private secretary, who died this morning at the age of 42. The news has prompted Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, to post on Twitter. PMQs - Snap verdict: A relatively low key exchange, but Corbyn chose two subjects where Cameron was vulnerable and he scored some modest hits (although he could probably have pushed Cameron harder about the Rudd leak). Cameron clearly felt a little frustrated about not being able to say more about the domestic violence announcement coming in the autumn statement, but he and Corbyn both know that what they said will be soon forgotten in the light of the big announcements coming shortly. Corbyn says today is the international day for the elimination of violence against women. Why are one third of those referred to English refuges being turned away? Cameron says the government has put more money into refuges, and that Osborne will say more about that in his statement. Corbyn quotes a domestic charity worker saying domestic violence victims have a right to the best treatment. The government signed the Istanbul convention making the right to women’s services statutory. When will the government ratify that? Cameron says the government is going further. He says Osborne will address this in his statement. No government before this one has a stronger record, he says. Corbyn says a UN chief scientist has said Britain has gone backwards on renewable energy. Cameron says he does not accept that. When the cost of renewable energy falls, subsidies should fall too. Otherwise the cost of energy to taxpayers rises. He also says he his building the first nuclear power station for a long time. Corbyn says 1,000 jobs have gone from solar panel firms. He reads out a question from a solar panel apprentice asking why Cameron is throwing away the progress made in this area. Cameron says more than 1m homes were fitted with solar panels in the last parliament. But the cost has fallen, so the subsidies should fall too, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says 55 Labour councils have made a commitment to run their areas on green energy by 2050. Will Cameron commend them, and urge Conservative councils to do the same. Cameron says he wants to promote green energy. He will be taking part in the Paris climate talks. But action must be taken locally as well, he says. In the last parliament there was a trebling of the introducing of renewable energy. Corbyn says Cameron used to say his was the greenest government ever. Does Cameron agree with Amber Rudd that the government will miss its renewable energy target for 2020? Cameron says his last government was the greenest government ever. It also helped other countries go green. He ignores the point about Amber Rudd completely. Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, asks if the announcements in today’s autumn statement will pass Cameron’s “family test” (ie, that they should support families). Cameron says George Osborne will have something to say about families later. David Cameron is now taking prime minister’s questions. I will just be focusing on the exchanges with Jeremy Corbyn, and any autumn statement-related material. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says we could hear pension tax relief changes for top earners, and a potential increase in fuel duty: Rumours are rife with news that Osborne will be stopping higher earners from cashing in on pension tax relief before he reforms the way this works next Spring. Hopefully he’ll step up to the plate and sort out the pension exit fees that are punishing over 55’s that take advantage of his new pension freedoms rise too. While he’s likely to back peddle on his tax credit reforms, he could end up hitting the same households if he targets housing benefit instead. A trip to the pump this morning could be worth your while as a fuel duty hike seems inevitable. Petrol and diesel prices are the lowest we’ve seen for a long time so drivers should expect a second shock after already swallowing the £13 av. increase in insurance premium tax. Evgeny Lebedev, who owns the Evening Standard, looks as if he has just tweeted an autumn statement announcement. And George Osborne has been tweeting ahead of his statement too. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has tweeted about the autumn statement. Torsten Bell, a former Treasury civil servant and Labour adviser who now runs the Resolution Foundation, has this take on the importance of autumn statements. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is surprisingly sceptical about the plans that George Osborne is due to announce for 400,000 new homes. This is from Jeremy Blackburn, the RICS head of policy. A push towards affordable home ownership should not come at the expense of affordable homes for rent. If cities such as London are to thrive, we need to ensure that housing can be provided for all of its workforce - home ownership can only go so far and even shared ownership may prove too expensive for some. We would like to see the chancellor incentivise affordable homes for rent in both public and private sectors. George Osborne is essentially subsidising one sector of the housing market over all others, in an area that already benefits from significant Government funding. Although the announcement is on the face of it encouraging for certain sectors, the devil will be in the detail. Anyone got any spare metallic paint? George Osborne has just left the Treasury (no, not permanently), and hopped into his limo for the short journey to parliament: Fingers crossed that we avoid a second prang. Lord Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, has told the Guardian in an interview that some councils could effectively go bust if the cuts in the spending review are as deep as expected. Britain’s barristers are worried that the justice system could be imperilled if the chancellor swings the axe in its direction today. Chairman of the Bar Council, Alistair MacDonald QC says: “It is because citizens have access to justice that big businesses pay their small firm suppliers in good time, that parents can get the right pay and leave from their employers, and that elderly people get the care to which they are entitled. “The idea that people who need to use the courts are being subsidised by the tax-payer is completely wrong. When people use the courts and other legal avenues to enforce the law, it helps to ensure that we all play by the rules. Without access to justice, everyone will suffer because the rules will cease to matter.” Our colleague Martin Kettle has written a piece this morning saying we would be better off just abolishing autumn statements and spending reviews. Here’s an extract. There is a very strong case for saying that both rituals are largely unnecessary and that, in particular, they allow the Treasury and the chancellor to get far too tough a grip on the government’s strategy and approach. While accepting that today’s speech and announcements are indisputably important as framing exercises, it is also important to stress that they don’t need to be treated as respectfully as they are. In short, we might be better off without either of them. But surely we have to have them? No we don’t. Unlike the annual budget, the autumn statement and the spending review are recent inventions: the autumn statement dates from 1976; the spending review only from 1998. Neither of them is an ordained or ancient part of the way UK government works. The autumn statement is a purely political confection. It has no economic purpose. It exists primarily to allow the chancellor to command a second big parliamentary event of the year (indeed this is the third of 2015, in which Osborne has already delivered two budgets, one of them only four months ago). In essence the same applies to the spending review, which was invented by Gordon Brown ostensibly to give the appearance of having a sensible long-term economic strategy. It succeeded in that political aim, though the strategy didn’t turn out as cleverly as Brown claimed and most observers accepted at the time. In reality, the spending review was conjured up to enable Brown to bind all his rival departmental ministers into decisions from which they could not escape. The spending review is about the assertion of political power — the chancellor’s power — not economic strategy. Here is Patrick Wintour’s full story on how the government is planning to breach its welfare cap. There was a slight prang in Downing Street earlier. Bad omen? If George Osborne does breach the welfare cap it will be all the more remarkable because even Jeremy Corbyn said he accepted it; he said so in an interview to the New Statesman in September. Here are some pictures of ministers arriving and leaving Number 10 for today’s autumn statement cabinet meeting. Theresa May, the home secretary, is braced for cuts - and did not look overly cheerful. Health is getting more money, which may be why Jeremy Hunt looked more upbeat. The Department for Business is expecting cuts. Here’s Sajid Javid, the business secretary, and Priti Patel, the employment minister. God knows what’s happening to the small business budget, but Anna Soubry, the small business minister, looks like she’s had a shock. Unlike David Cameron who looks, well, as smug as ever ... Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabians, has blogged about how breaching the welfare cap would ‘liberate’ the chancellor: it was Osborne’s pre-election promise of £12 billion of cuts to welfare that really did the damage and led inexorably to the tax credit reforms. First Osborne made the welfare pledge, then he protected pensioners and the severely disabled, and finally he realised that a Tory-only Treasury could not impose cash cuts on the very worst off who are not in work. There was no choice left but to hit the working poor. It is sometimes said that George Osborne never expected to implement the £12bn promise. It was designed only as a negotiating position in advance of post-election coalition talks. Whatever the truth in that, now the chancellor must let it go and cancel the cuts planned for existing tax credit claimants. And that also means increasing the value of the ‘welfare cap’, Osborne’s self-imposed straightjacket which he tightened at the last Budget and he can now loosen again. Ditching the welfare pledge would be liberating, because if Osborne scraps that one promise he will suddenly have lots of options before him. More here: The welfare pledge: Osborne is a prisoner of his own imagination Does every u-turn have a silver lining? Nick Clegg’s former special advisor, Polly Mackenzie, reckons it might: . Rupert Harrison used to be George Osborne’s chief of staff. He is working in the City now, and using Twitter to advise people not to be taken in by Treasury “expectation management” ahead of the autumn statement. Jonathan Portes also hopes that the welfare cap might be dropped altogether: The Welfare Cap shows the dangers of ‘soundbite’ driven fiscal policy, argues economist Jonathan Portes, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research: One of the criticisms of George Osborne as chancellor is that he can be too clever by half, that some of his political schemes are so devious that they can backfire. For anyone advancing this theory, the welfare cap now looks like an ideal example. Osborne announced a welfare cap, a cap on the overall amount the government can spend on certain welfare payments, in the budget of 2014. It is not the same as the benefits cap, the cap on the amount of benefits that an out-of-work family can receive (originally £26,000, but now being cut to £20,000 for families outside London.) The benefits cap proved remarkably popular with voters, and so Osborne decided to apply the same principle to overall welfare spending. At the time it was perceived primarily as a trap for Labour; Osborne was hoping that the opposition would vote against, thus allowing him to depict them as profligate with welfare spending. In the event this ploy failed, because Ed Miliband and Ed Balls decided their party should vote in favour of the welfare cap, and the issue quickly dropped out of the political headlines. As a restraint on government the welfare cap was always relatively ineffective because, under Osborne’s proposal, any government could break i and spend more if it wanted to. But it would have to go to the Commons to win approval in a vote. Osborne argued that this would prove embarrassing, and that the unappetising prospect of having to ask MPs to vote for extra welfare spending would act as a deterrent. In the debate on the welfare cap in March 2014 he said that breaching the welfare cap would be “a failure of public expenditure control”. Any chancellor taking this step would have to admit that what they really want is “higher welfare bills”, he said. The charter makes clear what will happen if the welfare cap is breached. The chancellor must come to parliament, account for the failure of public expenditure control, and set out the action that will be taken to address the breach ... The welfare cap brings responsibility, accountability and fairness. Those who want to undo our welfare reforms will now have to tell us about the other cuts that they will make, or else come clean and admit to the public that what they really want are higher welfare bills .. From now on, any government who want to spend more on welfare will have to be honest with the public—honest about the costs—and secure the approval of parliament in order to breach the cap. Expect those words to be flung back at Osborne this afternoon. Now it seems that he is going to have to go to parliament himself and admit that he’s the one asking for “higher welfare bills” because he’s failed to meet his own spending targets. The news that George Osborne is planning to breach his own welfare cap is causing a stir on Twitter: Financial Times political correspondent John McDermott says Osborne still has a little ‘wiggle room’, though: Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MPs for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, predicts two u-turns from the chancellor, on the welfare cap and on the 2020 budget surplus. George Osborne has set in train plans to breach the Treasury’s welfare cap after deciding it cannot find enough welfare savings to compensate for the decision to slow the pace of cuts to tax credits. The chancellor has held discussions with the Department of Work and Pensions to arrange a Commons vote that would give the government permission to breach the cap. The vote will be passed by MPs but the decision is likely to be seen as a political embarrassment for Osborne since he largely invented the self imposed cap in the last parliament as a trap to show Labour is lax on welfare spending. In the end the shadow chancellor Ed Balls embraced the cap. The request to the DWP suggests that cuts to housing benefit likely to be found in Wednesday’s Autumn Statement will fall short of the £4.4 bn that would have been saved by changing the threshold of tax credit payments. Osborne has many options to mitigate the impact of the tax credits and some would not require him to bust his plan to have the budget in overall annual surplus by the end of the parliament, probably the single biggest target he has set himself. Osborne, speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme on Sunday referred to the need to go back to parliament if we was to breach the welfare cap, but he was not pressed on whether he intended to do so. Overnight it emerged that housing will be a big focus in the autumn statement. As the Guardian splash reveals, George Osborne will commit himself to “the biggest affordable housebuilding programme since the 1970s – with over 400,000 new homes built across England”. Labour has dismissed this as hot air. This is from John Healey, the shadow housing minister. If hot air built homes, then Conservative ministers would have our housing crisis sorted. A matter of weeks ago the housing minister promised a million more homes, now George Osborne is saying they’ll build 400,000 more. George Osborne’s first act as chancellor in 2010 was to slash housing investment by 60%, and his plans today could still mean 40% less to build the homes we need compared to the investment programme he inherited from Labour. The Tories’ housing record speaks for itself. The lowest peacetime level of housebuilding since David Lloyd George was prime minister in the 1920s, home ownership fallen year-on-year to the lowest level in a generation, and alongside the lowest number of genuinely affordable homes built in two decades, the number of affordable homes to buy halved since 2010. The Centre for Economics and Business Research believes George Osborne could be facing a £30bn ‘black hole’ in his budget forecasts. Like many economists, the CEBR believes this year’s deficit will be higher than the £69.5bn forecast. But it also reckons that economic growth will be weaker than expected - leaving the UK with a deficit of almost £20bn in 2020, not the £10bn surplus currently pencilled in. The Cebr explains: “Because the Chancellor’s forecasts rely on an implausibly high rate of growth we think that the Government’s fiscal position is much less favourable than was set out in the July Budget. “The deficit will not be eliminated in the current Parliament.” That chimes with the IFS’s warning early this morning, although it doesn’t expect major revisions to growth forecasts today. Shares in Britain’s house builders are rallying this morning, on the back of reports that the chancellor will pledge an extra £7bn of fresh investment in housing. Trader have pushed Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard: Osborne is expected to promise 400,000 new homes, to “turn generation rent into generation buy”. The trick to successful trap-laying is to make damn sure that you lure your quarry, rather than falling into it. But Sky’s Faisal Islam believes that George Osborne may have snared himself with his decision to cap Britain’s welfare bill. He’s doesn’t appear to have left himself any margin to change course on tax credits, without pushing up the bill. Faisal explains: The problem arises because Mr Osborne, in addition to making sharp welfare cuts, chose to push down the welfare cap to the levels of welfare spending forecast in July by the Office for Budget Responsibility - £115bn in the 2016/17 financial year. This means there is no wriggle room for a significantly more generous phasing of tax credits in the coming year without busting the cap. The OBR assesses compliance with the welfare cap under the Charter for Budget Responsibility at every Autumn Statement. The policy was designed as a trap for Labour, but the Chancellor would appear to have been caught in it himself. “It’ll be breached ... he’s not going to get it for next year,” said one Westminster source. Under Osborne’s original plans to cut tax credits by £4.4bn, the Resolution Foundation said that 3.3m families would lose on average £1,300 a year. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, under the revised plans families earning around £20,000 a year could now lose “only” around £300 a year. The inverted commas around that “only” are important; the problem for Osborne is that the sums involved in the original cuts were so enormous that, even if he takes substantial steps to lessen their impact, they will probably still hammer the blue-collar, inwork “strivers” that the Tories claim to represent. You can also get up to speed on today’s events with our Q&amp;A on the spending review, explaining which departments could be hit hardest: Katie Allen has pulled together the most important charts to explain today’s autumn statement: It shows how Britain has rarely achieved a budget surplus. The last one was back in 2001: The most influential commentator on the autumn statement, by a mile, is the director of the tax and spending thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies. As all chancellors have discovered in recent years, if you can persuade the IFS that your numbers stack up, in the court of informed opinion you’ve won, regardless of what the opposition or anyone else has to say. But if the IFS is critical, you’re in trouble. The current head of the IFS is Paul Johnson and he was on the Today programme this morning. He made two key points. Johnson said that Osborne’s goal of running a surplus of £10bn by 2019-20 would be “close to impossible” to achieve if the economy underperformed. [Osborne] set himself a really tough target to get to this surplus in 2019, and the problem with this target is it’s very much unlike the targets he set himself in the last parliament; it is fixed and inflexible. So if it turns out that the economy does even a little worse than he’s expecting over the next few years, I think it will be close to impossible to meet unless he’s going to put some tax increases in place. If the economy pans out as he currently expects, and tax revenues come in as he expects, it might be just about reachable but only at the cost of really big cuts in things like the Home Office, local government and other departments. He said that in economic terms it would not matter much if Osborne missed the 2019-20 deadline for running a budget surplus. There is a reasonable case to be made for getting into surplus at some point because that increases the rate at which we pay down the debt we have, which is currently around 80% of national income which is quite a high level. But whether he meets that target in 2019 or 2020 or 2021 doesn’t matter terribly much from an economic point of view. From an economic point of view, even if you want to get into surplus and stay there, the speed in which you do it doesn’t matter that much, as much as getting there within some period. The latest borrowing forecasts are unlikely to bring much cheer. The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to revise UP its forecast for the deficit this financial year, from £69.5bn to perhaps £74bn. That’s because last month’s public finance figures were alarmingly poor, with Britain borrowing more than at any time since 2009 to cover weak tax revenues. So while this year’s deficit (the black line above) will still be lower than last year (the blue line), it might be several billion pounds higher than we were promised in the budget. That’s a blow to a chancellor who has welded his reputation to the cause of deficit reduction. It also gives George Osborne less wriggle room to soften austerity, if he remains committed to balancing the books his parliament. And crucially, the OBR (Britain’s fiscal watchdog) might conclude that borrowing will be higher in future years too. That would put Osborne’s goal of a £10bn surplus in 2019-20 in doubt. Although tax credits could dominate the headlines, economists are looking for some other measures to stimulate growth. We already know that the chancellor is planning to boost housebuilding, to address Britain’s affordable housing crisis. Businesses will be crossing their fingers that the government shakes up business rates; many are paying rates based on property values before the 2008 crash. Infrastructure spending - a perennial favourite. The chancellor will surely bang the drum for the Northern Powerhouse, while Labour’s John McDonnell will rebut that the UK is still spending less than the 3.5% of GDP which the OECD recommends Drivers have benefitted from a freeze on fuel duty. But prices at the pump are lower, now oil is trading below $50 per barrel, so Osborne might decide that the nation’s wallets and purses can handle a higher fuel levy. Today’s autumn statement from George Osborne was supposed to be the big political event of last quarter of the year. In the event, because of the Paris attacks, it does not quite feel like that, but nonetheless this is one of the landmark political moments of the year - and of the parliament too. This is what we’re getting. 1) An autumn statement - a mini budget in itself. 2) A spending review, covering government spending until 2019-20. Osborne wants to eliminate the deficit by the end of the decade and so his spending review is going to involve very, very deep cuts to departments that are not protected. It will change the shape of the state, and alter long-term what it does. 3) A solution to the tax credits crisis. The House of Lords rejected Osborne’s plan to save £4.4bn by cutting tax credits, and today Osborne will offer an alternative approach. In some respects this will amount to a U-turn.

Gordon Brown faced a similar problem when his abolition of the 10p starting rate of tax backfired, and that episode damaged his reputation almost beyond repair. 4) A settlement for the police.

The French president, who has been battling low approval ratings and dissent within his party as well as government ranks, used a TV interview for Bastille Day celebrations on 14 July to push a new optimistic official line, vowing to \"fight\" French pessimism. \"The economic recovery is here,\" he said, adding that it was \"very slight\" but insisting that industrial production had picked up, there had been a small recovery in consumption and job hires had started to increase. But commentators were quick to question the rise in industrial production this spring which had appeared to drop again shortly after. Hollande vowed to tackle France's standing as the most pessimistic country in Europe, \"perhaps in the world\", lamenting: \"There are countries at war who are more optimistic than us.\" He acknowledged that France was still struggling to get its deficit under control and that he could not rule out more tax rises to help balance the budget. But he said: \"I will increase taxes only if necessary, ideally as little as possible.\" Hollande also used the interview from the sun-drenched gardens of the Elysée Palace to contain a growing row over shale gas in France. \"As long as I am president, there will be no exploration for shale gas in France,\" he declared, putting an end to speculation that France might lift its ban on controversial drilling techniques. Ever since Hollande sacked his environment minister Delphine Batho this month after she criticised government budget cuts, the president has been under pressure to prove that he is serious about ecology and is not in thrall to the oil and gas lobby. Batho had said that her opposition to shale gas drilling cost her her job, and that lobbies in favour of shale gas and nuclear power had wanted her \"scalp\". The International Energy Agency has named France as a European country with some of the most plentiful underground reserves of shale gas. But France is one of the few countries that has outlawed the controversial and potentially polluting process of hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – in drilling for shale gas. The ban, which was voted in under Nicolas Sarkozy, has been continued by the Socialist Hollande, who has two Green ministers in his government. But a legal challenge to the fracking ban has been brought by a US firm which remains keen to explore in the southern French countryside. Debate was further stirred recently when the outspoken industry minister, Arnaud Montebourg, suggested creating a state-backed company to examine exploration techniques. Hollande also insisted on the importance of maintenance of French train lines after a passenger train derailment south of Paris caused six deaths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/24/merkel-searches-partners-build-coalition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-24T10:55:30Z","webTitle":"Merkel searches for partners to build ruling coalition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/merkel-searches-partners-build-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/24/merkel-searches-partners-build-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Merkel searches for partners to build ruling coalition","bodyText":"Angela Merkel fired the starting gun for weeks of negotiations as the candidates for a new coalition government jockeyed for position. Given that each of her previous coalition partners suffered massive losses because of allying with her, analysts predicted that parties are unlikely to rush into her arms. Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the Social Democrats, quickly dismissed speculation that a \"grand coalition\" would be a foregone conclusion. \"It's up to Merkel to tell us what she wants … we don't want to be the next coalition partner driven into ruin by her,\" he said. After Merkel announced in a lunchtime press conference on Monday that she had already contacted the Social Democrats and \"doesn't rule out taking these talks further\", Gabriel stated that he wouldn't be available for talks until Friday. Merkel led her conservatives to their best result in more than 20 years: the Christian Democratic Union and its sister party won 41.5% of the vote in Sunday's election. Final results gave the CDU/CSU 311 seats, the SPD 192, the Left party 64 and the Greens 63. A number of politicians on the left called for coalition talks between the SPD, the Greens and the leftwing Die Linke, a grouping which would have a theoretical majority over Merkel's party. \"Let's talk to all of the parties, including Die Linke,\" tweeted Green party veteran Christian Ströbele. \"The 'leftwing camp' has a majority in parliament.\" Cem Özdemir, the Green co-chairman who is on his party's more conservative \"Realo\" wing, on Monday implied in an interview that the Greens should make use of the Free Liberals' collapse and move into their place: \"There is such a thing as the legacy of political liberalism, which we have already partly inherited.\" A minority government for Merkel's CDU remains possible only in theory, after Merkel on Monday ruled out going alone while there remains a threat of further turbulence in the eurozone: \"We want a stable government,\" she said. While coalition speculation continues, a new generation of locally elected politicians will prepare themselves for their first stint in the Bundestag. The next German government will include Cemile Giousouf, the first Muslim MP from Merkel's Christian Democrats. It will also have its first two black MPs, a milestone in a country which is believed to be home to around 500,000 people of recent African descent. Karamba Diaby, born in Senegal, will be representing the town of Halle for the SPD in the former east Germany. A chemist, Diaby, 51, gained German citizenship in 2001 and pledged to fight for equal opportunities in education. \"Every child born in Germany should have the chance to be successful in school regardless of their social background or the income of their parents,\" he said. Charles M Huber, a TV actor born in Munich, whose father is Senegalese, will represent the CDU. For Merkel's party, finding a coalition partner may take weeks, if not months. After the last grand coalition, from 2005 to 2009, the SPD was punished with the worst result in its history. While the parties broadly agree on many policy areas, including Europe, there will be pressure from the SPD's left wing to get Merkel to concede on key policies such as the minimum wage and dual citizenship. Some Social Democrats have reportedly called for a member vote on a grand coalition. A coalition with the weakened Green party, whose leadership on Monday also offered its joint resignation after a disappointing result, could be a less fractious option. The former protest party has gravitated to the political centre over the years, and its key message of environmental responsibility could be said to chime with the CDU's emphasis on fiscal responsibility. The Green party has also been a vocal supporter of Germany's nuclear power phase-out under Merkel, and could help her realise her aim in a coalition. However, a mere glance at the two party programmes would highlight the possibility of several confrontations between themm parties: on gay marriage, dual citizenship, drugs policy or tax rates, the CDU and Greens positions are far apart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/apr/01/partisan-voices-in-energy-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-01T20:00:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Partisan voices in the energy debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/01/partisan-voices-in-energy-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/apr/01/partisan-voices-in-energy-debate","fields":{"headline":"Partisan voices in the energy debate","bodyText":"Decades of detailed academic, industry and government analysis has shown repeatedly that it is possible for the UK (and the world at large) to achieve sufficient, reliable, economically viable energy services entirely from renewables. Crucially, however, \"possible\" is not the same as \"easy\" or \"desirable\". Politics and values are also involved. It is also possible to pursue a variety of radically different energy futures, some including nuclear power. But we cannot fully realise all possibilities. When a democracy views such complexity, uncertainty and plurality, vital space is opened for debate. Partisan voices are inevitable – and necessary. Yet it is the role of government science advisers to inform (not deny or coerce) democratic choice. This may legitimately include expression of personal preferences. But it is deeply disquieting that UK chief scientists such as Sir John Beddington (and Sir David King before him) should so often misappropriate the voice of science as a whole, to assert falsely that an entirely renewable future is simply not possible (Letters, 29 March). That truth is such a frequent casualty at such levels is one of the strongest grounds for concern over the institutional implications of nuclear power. Andy Stirling Professor of science and technology policy, University of Sussex • It's not surprising that green measures are set to save householders money in the long term (Climate change policies 'will keep bills down', 27 March). But, while last week's government report acknowledges the financial benefits of climate change policies, the coalition appears hamstrung by George Osborne's obsession with burning gas, and by the snail's pace at which the energy savings we so urgently need are coming to fruition. The government admits that it will take another nine years for just half of us to have any major insulation measure in our homes. On top of this, the coalition's plans would have 20 new gas-fired power stations built in the UK, potentially burning away our hopes of meeting our carbon reduction targets. If the government takes its own research seriously it will redouble efforts to reduce energy demand and drive down fuel poverty by helping the least well-off insulate their homes properly. Additionally we need to see serious investment in renewables – something that was mysteriously sidelined in the budget – to provide secure energy for the future and thousands of jobs that are desperately needed right now. Keith Taylor MEP Green party, South-East England • The coalition's claims that its climate change policies will keep bills down sound remarkably similar to those made by the Conservative government in the 1980s. The claims then were that energy prices charged by the denationalised industries would be smaller than if the industries had continued in public ownership. Nobody in their right mind would agree that it happened. The claims then were just as specious as they are now. The best way, by far, to cut energy bills is to make sure that the country is energy-efficient, in particular, that buildings are properly insulated – something that could generate an industry overnight and an element of recovery. K Vines Yelverton, Devon • In response to your report that \"business could expect much bigger rises in energy prices\", Mark Swift is correct, this is \"a wake-up call\". However, there are simple measures that business can be taking to reduce costs and control their outgoings. Energy management standards such as ISO 50001 can reduce corporate gas consumption by providing a model for assessing energy baselines, determining how much energy an organisation should be using compared to its actual consumption. Energy saving steps include the installation of smart meters and improving insulation. This more pragmatic approach to energy efficiency should be taken by industry with immediate effect. It is important that businesses are nimble and implement simple measures to reduce their gas consumption before the expected rises impact their bottom line.

It is, in fact, embarking on a plan to build a network around bikes and pedestrians, linking car-free roads to parks and playgrounds, from the city centre to the suburbs. Welcome to Hamburg, an environmental pioneer in the mould of its regional neighbour Copenhagen. Its planned green network will cover 40% of the city's area. \"It will connect parks, recreational areas, playgrounds, gardens and cemeteries through green paths\", Angelika Fritsch, a spokeswoman for the city's department of urban planning and the environment, tells Guardian Sustainable Business. \"Other cities, including London, have green rings, but the green network will be unique in covering an area from the outskirts to the city centre. In 15 to 20 years you'll be able to explore the city exclusively on bike and foot.\" The green network will even connect animal habitats, enabling critters to crisscross the city without risk of being run over. Perhaps more importantly, the network will absorb CO2 emissions and help prevent floods when inevitable superstorms strike. \"Hamburg has always been a green city with lots of parks\", notes Jens Kerstan, leader of the Green Party in Hamburg's state parliament. \"The green network makes sense from a climate change adaptation perspective, especially since our residents are quite progressive when it comes to climate change adaptation. Many Hamburgers are willing to give up their cars, which is very unusual in Germany.\" Climate change will, in fact, leave cities little choice but to develop plans like the green network. Fritsch points out that thanks to its sea winds, Hamburg is better positioned to combat warmer temperatures than, say, Berlin. But increasing temperatures are already affecting this North Sea metropolis as well. \"Today the average annual temperature is nine degrees Celsius, 1.2 degrees more than it was 60 years ago\", reports Dr Insa Meinke, director of the North German Climate Bureau at the Institut für Küstenforschung (Institute of Coastal Research). \"When we have a cold winter there are always people saying, 'so where's your climate change now?', but the cold winters are simply fluctuations.\" According to data from the Institute for Coastal Research, Hamburg had five hot (above 30 degrees Celsius) summer days last year, compared to two in 1952. Climate change is already affecting the port city's water level as well. \"Compared to 60 years ago, the sea level here has risen by 20 centimetres\", explains Meinke. \"As a large city, Hamburg is truly at risk. Storm surges could rise by another 30 to 110 centimetres by 2100.\" Hamburg, in other words, needs its green network because it will help limit the effects of floods. There are benefits to tackling climate change early on. Cities know that if they make themselves greener and more pedestrian-and-bike-friendly, they'll attract more of the people they need to remain competitive. According to Fritsch, given that residents – especially children, the elderly and the ill – will suffer when temperatures rise, making the city climate as comfortable as possible is \"very important in order to provide quality of life for our residents looking ahead to 2050\". Dr Sven Schulze, an analyst at the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI), notes that the green network could take up space that's needed for housing and businesses, but \"on the other hand, it brings economic advantages because it attracts highly educated and competent people to the city.\" That's, of course, a recipe successfully pioneered by Copenhagen. But unlike Copenhagen, Hamburg hasn't got very far in implementing its grand design. \"The green network is an excellent idea, but we're still in the early stages\", notes Kerstan. \"The visionary thinking is done by the civil servants, not by the politicians currently in charge. Ever since Fukushima, the focus in Germany has been on moving away from nuclear power, not on climate change adaptation.\" Currently some 30 city staff are developing the green network, aided by personnel in the city's seven districts. When politicians make the green web a priority, it will be an extensive network indeed, covering some 7,000 hectares. And Fritsch's team envisions a network that doesn't just help residents get from point A to point B in a sustainable fashion. \"It will offer people opportunities to hike, swim, do water sports, enjoy picnics and restaurants, experience calm and watch nature and wildlife right in the city\", she explains. \"That reduces the need to take the car for weekend outings outside the city, which further reduces the damage to the environment.\" Modern city life: walking, biking, watching nature right where you live.

Is he godsend or Satan? When he said on Monday that Britain must take another £25bn in \"cuts\", half of them from welfare, was he declaring a manifest truth or peddling a tissue of electioneering mendacity? The trouble is the answer must be one thing or the other. It will depend not on the answer but the answerer, on tribal membership. There was no way that Ed Balls for Labour or Nick Clegg for the Liberal Democrats would yield an inch to Osborne. As a Tory he was not necessarily wrong, just wrong tribe. A horrible possibility is starting to dawn on Osborne's opponents. His classic election-cycle strategy – early austerity then boom as the next election approaches – might be working. His deficit and borrowing targets might be adrift and his cuts callous or chaotic, but growth has clearly returned. Politics is about ends not means. Britain's least popular man in recession could be forgiven a mild satisfaction in now giving his party at least a ghost of a chance in 2015. I continue to believe that Osborne was wrong in his approach to the recession. Guided by City friends, he pretended to extreme austerity to maintain \"credit confidence abroad\", but he thereby wrecked credit confidence at home. He imposed on the economy a savage liquidity squeeze, with 20% VAT on high-street spending, with commodity prices rising and credit drying up. Osborne forced banks to build up reserves, and when he printed \"new money\" it was not for the public to put into circulation but for banks to save. When triple-dip recession threatened a year ago, he simply threw billions into inflating the housing market, his one successful act of monetarism. Osborne was like his predecessor, Alistair Darling, in not calling on the intellectual muscle to challenge the City and the Bank of England as they collapsed under the twin burdens of impending bankruptcy and Sir Mervyn King. The \"regrets\" of departing monetary policy committee members – among them David Blanchflower, Kate Barker and Adam Posen – should enrage Britain's bankrupts and unemployed. The poor got nothing and the bankers got billions. Yet at the same time, and contrary to political lore, Osborne did not cut public spending. In 2009, at the high point of Gordon Brown's squandermania, total government spending was £633bn. After four years of supposed \"austerity\" it has risen to £718bn, and in 2015 it will rise to £728bn. Even in real terms it dipped only marginally between 2011 and 2012 (by 1.5%). The British people have seen nothing to compare with the real cuts imposed on Greeks or Spaniards, or on Canadians to balance their books back in the 1990s. Any critic wanting to portray Osborne as a \"son of Gordon Brown\" would have no trouble. His borrowing is exorbitant, hovering around £100bn. He has been fiscally reckless in safeguarding the NHS budget, education and overseas aid. The state pay bill was sustained at least until this year, despite a \"pay freeze\". The Office of National Statistics showed government workers moving ahead of private sector ones by 8% by 2012, the gap narrowing only in the past year. This was never true under Labour. Most departments are still outspending what they did in the lavish Blair years. Even the much-abused culture budget was £6.7bn in 2012 (excluding the Olympics) against just £4.9bn in 2008. The big loser has been local government. There have been annual cuts of up to 15% in the quarter of public spending that passes through local councils. They have borne the lion's share of the burden so as to relieve Whitehall budgets of real pain. Not since Margaret Thatcher has \"local Britain\" been so abused as under this coalition. Osborne and David Cameron regard it as politically expendable territory. But the result is for a largely phoney \"cuts narrative\" to be overwhelmed by real cuts in day centres for the elderly, childcare, sports clubs, museums and theatres. Frontline services that people notice have truly suffered. Behind all this lies a gigantic irony, that while Osborne's squeeze extended the recession in high-street spending and thus hit the private sector, his relative leniency towards the public sector rescued demand from even worse suffering. It was Osborne the spendthrift who nursed eventual recovery. To this extent he was more a Labour chancellor than a Tory one. Indeed, after listening to Balls evade every question put to him this week, I realised he would have done much the same as Osborne, mistakes and all. Balls never challenged Osborne's subservience to the City and the Bank. He never questioned the liquidity squeeze or demanded risks be taken with inflation. He pretended Osborne was fiscally austere, when he must have known he was not – hence his waffling response to Osborne's remarks on welfare. What has made Osborne an easy target for his enemies – and deflected attention from what is good in his policy – have been his crude lapses into favouritism. He reduced top-rate tax for the rich. He refused to revalue expensive homes for council tax. He has given billions of pounds to wealthy land-owners for wind turbines. He continues to spend insane sums on nuclear power stations, aircraft carriers and high-speed trains. Last year he squandered cash on housing developers just when the housing market was recovering. He thus played to Balls's one strong suit, that Osborne's economics are \"unfair\". This should still not affect the validity of Osborne's basic message, that Britain's debts are cripplingly expensive and will get more so as interest rates rise. While they could be ignored in recession, they must be tackled in recovery. As Keynes said: \"The boom not the slump is the right time for austerity.\" Almost all independent opinion – on Monday, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies – accepts that £25bn of further cuts is a minimum to begin to bring down the debt burden by 2018. Some cuts in welfare obligations are unavoidable to achieve it. However such cuts are dressed up, there really should be a degree of consensus on a prudent path for Britain from a terrible recession to the uplands of stable growth. As it is, this week's debate on the economy has been near illiterate. There was no argument, just tribal warfare."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/aug/01/howells-comments-tories-utter-contempt-northeast","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-01T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Howell's comments show Tories' utter contempt for north-east","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/01/howells-comments-tories-utter-contempt-northeast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/aug/01/howells-comments-tories-utter-contempt-northeast","fields":{"headline":"Howell's comments show Tories' utter contempt for north-east","bodyText":"We are dismayed by Lord Howell's comments that the north-east is \"desolate\" (Report, 31 July).

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the government rejected advice from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), regarding the lessons to be learned following Japan's Fukushima disaster. The regulator recommended restricting development near nuclear plants, advice that was overridden last week when the government approved the expansion of Lydd airport in Kent, a couple of miles from Dungeness nuclear power station. Mike Weightman, HM chief inspector for nuclear installations, wrote a report for the government about the lessons to be learned from the Japanese meltdown, which said: \"In light of the events at Fukushima, we consider that it is timely for the relevant government departments in the UK to examine the existing system of planning controls for developments in the vicinity of nuclear sites and consider the need for improvements.\" Weightman felt that the current planning control system did not go far enough. His argument was then backed by the ONR, which recommended to the Department for Energy and Climate Change that there should be \"a review of the adequacy of planning controls governing the construction of residential and commercial developments near nuclear power plants\". The regulator demanded that the constraints should be incorporated into the National Planning Policy Framework, the government's new overarching document which determines development and has proved controversial with some heritage and environmental groups because of what they perceive to be its \"pro-build\" ethos. The ONR also sought \"statutory consultee status\" so that its regulatory advice would be given more weight in planning matters, and even wrote to the Department for Communities and Local Government calling for national planning policy to treat safety and security developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities similar to flood risks. The regulator was determined to check future house-building and commerical expansion near nuclear plants. In 2010, the ONR had outlined the case against the building of new homes next to Aldermaston atomic energy facility, only for the secretary of state, Eric Pickles, to reject its objections. In a letter to DCLG, obtained by the Observer, the ONR explained that the Aldermaston case \"highlighted the fact that nuclear administrative arrangements for developments around nuclear installations have not been modernised and incorporated into the current national spatial planning framework. This means that appropriate weight is not given to nuclear safety and security concerns in the planning balance\". The regulator was clearly alarmed that the government's draft planning framework document failed to reflect its views. The ONR's letter explains \"the draft framework document makes no mention of any constraint to developments in the vicinity of nuclear facilities, nor indeed other high hazard facilities … While we recognise and accept the reasoning behind the government's policy presumption in favour of positive planning decisions, for these to be sustainable it is important to ensure that we do not undermine other important government policies, such as the need to control developments around nuclear installations that are designed to ensure that people and society are properly protected.\" But the energy department rejected the thrust of the regulation office's demands. Instead, the NPPF stated only that planning policies should be \"based on up-to-date information on the location of major hazards\" and that \"local planning authorities should consult the appropriate bodies when planning\". Documents released under freedom of information reveal the ONR's increasing alarm that its demands were being ignored as the framework was developed. In an email in December 2011, an ONR official asks his counterpart in the Office for Nuclear Development, part of the energy department, \"if there is any pressure you can apply in order to get us a meeting with DCLG?\" Louise Barton, of Lydd Airport Action Group, described the failure to rein in development near nuclear facilities as \"reprehensible\". She said: \"The recommendation was made to save lives. What right has Mr Pickles to sacrifice public safety for the sake of growth?\" A department spokeswoman said the letter of October 2011 had raised issues that had been addressed. \"For the first time the framework brings the requirements for local councils to work with the Office for Nuclear Regulation into one place,\" she said. \"This ensures that the presence of a nuclear installation is taken into account in all planning policy decisions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/earth-insight/2014/apr/07/ipcc-un-climate-change-mitigation-wg3-worsen-geoengineering","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-07T13:31:00Z","webTitle":"Leaked IPCC climate plan to worsen global warming - ecologists | Nafeez Ahmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/apr/07/ipcc-un-climate-change-mitigation-wg3-worsen-geoengineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/apr/07/ipcc-un-climate-change-mitigation-wg3-worsen-geoengineering","fields":{"headline":"Leaked IPCC climate plan to worsen global warming - ecologists","bodyText":"A British environmental organisation that has reviewed the draft of a forthcoming UN IPCC report on mitigating climate change has questioned many of the document's recommendations as deeply flawed. Dr Rachel Smolker, co-director of Biofuelwatch, said that the report's embrace of \"largely untested\" and \"very risky\" technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), will \"exacerbate\" climate change, agricultural problems, water scarcity, soil erosion and energy challenges, \"rather than improving them.\" A leaked draft of the as yet unpublished report by Working Group 3 (WG3) of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be officially released in mid-April, was obtained by the Guardian. Dr Smolker, a behavioural ecologist and biofuels expert, said that the alarming impacts of climate change identified by the IPCC's Working Groups 1 and 2 would \"worsen\" as a consequence of such \"false solutions\" which have been increasingly criticised in the scientific literature. Avoiding \"overshoot\" The IPCC projects that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to stabilise at 450 parts per million (ppm), accepted by the international community as the safe limit to ensure that global average temperatures do not exceed the 2 degrees Celsius danger level. It is more likely that concentrations could \"overshoot\" to around 550 ppm (if not higher by other less conservative projections). The leaked draft concludes that \"essentially any\" emissions target can be achieved \"regardless of the near‐term path\" of overshoot \"by shifting emissions reductions to the future\": \"There are no published scenarios depicting a pathway returning to 450 CO2‐e [emissions] by century's end without a negative emissions option when delayed participation is imposed. The vast majority of published 450 CO2‐e scenarios involve overshoot during the century and include a negative emissions technology.\" The draft thus recommends \"carbon negative\" energy technologies that might help to draw down carbon from the atmosphere. These include \"large scale utilisation of BECCS\"; coal and natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) - carbon emitted from burning fossil fuels is captured and injected underground where it is stored indefinitely; nuclear power; and large hydroelectric plants. Carbon capture, or multiplier? The problem, Biofuelwatch's co-director said, is that there is no scientific consensus on whether these technologies actually work. CCS technology is already being used to facilitate intensified fossil fuel exploitation. In bioenergy, it has involved \"capture of fermentation in ethanol refineries\": \"... so far much of carbon captured from bioenergy and other processes is ultimately used for Enhanced Oil Recovery – injected into depleted oil wells to create pressure enough to force remaining difficult to access oil out. This can hardly be considered 'sequestration' or an effective approach to solving the climate problem.\" She added that \"burning wood for electricity and heat releases up to 150% as much CO2 per unit of energy generation than does coal\" excluding emissions from \"deforestation, harvesting and transportation.\" According to Dr Smolker, CCS cannot be viewed as \"carbon negative\" due to \"the high costs, and associated high added energy demand for capture, transport, compression and injection.\" Even more problematic, she said, is that there is \"little real world testing\" of whether CO2 pumped into underground cavities \"will remain in situ\" indefinitely, or be released, which she describes as \"a dangerous gamble.\" Biofuelwatch also criticised the IPCC draft report's recommendation of large-scale bioenergy projects. Bioenergy \"should be considered a driver\" of emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use, Smolker said, \"not a means of mitigation.\" The growing use of bioenergy as a substitute for fossil fuels is encroaching increasingly on land use, and in turn escalating food prices, intensifying land grabbing, and increasing demand for crops, livestock, wood and so on: \"Lands and ecosystems cannot at the same time both provide large quantities of biomass for bioenergy, and still securely act as 'carbon sinks.' It is not possible to have it both ways.\" Currently, just under 40% of US corn production is dedicated to ethanol although it provides just \"a pittance of transport energy.\" The large areas of land required for meaningful bioenergy production means it would simultaneously undermine food production while contributing to \"escalating food prices.\" Although the IPCC proposes bioenergy as the solution to renewable energy, \"it can never provide more than a tiny fraction towards the current and projected growth in demand for energy.\" Broken climate needs fixing Stephen Salter, a professor emeritus of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh who has proposed cloud enhancement as one mechanism of geoengineering to address climate change, said that given the import of dangerous warming, techniques to reduce carbon in the atmosphere must be part of the toolbox. But he said the focus should be on the Arctic: \"Those working on geoengineering are largely doing so reluctantly. The concern is that we need to ensure technology is available in case events occur more quickly than expected. The IPCC has not fully accounted for certain feedbacks involving black carbon, methane release, and the rapid loss of the Arctic summer sea ice. A technique like marine cloud brightening by spraying seawater onto clouds to increase their reflectivity, could save the sea ice and help cool the climate with relatively little side-effects that can be controlled with careful application.\" But other geoengineering techniques suffer from less certainty, said Prof Salter, who is a member of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group (AMEG). \"Many major proposals suffer from debilitating costs and practicalities, and would take too long – up to a century or more - to work. And their risks are less understood.\" Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a geoscientist also at the University of Edinburgh specialising in CCS, said: \"Ultimately a full, immediate transition to renewables is the right imperative, but it cannot happen overnight due to the engineering costs and practicalities. So we must reduce our carbon emissions while we are still relying on fossil fuels. Our current emissions trajectory is heading for catastrophe. CCS would allow us to draw down emissions during the transition to renewables. Every component of CCS has been practiced separately in the industry for decades, so putting them altogether to minimise our carbon footprint makes sense. Several large-scale commercial CCS enterprises will become operational this year, such as the coal-fired plant in Kemper County. 100% renewable transition in 15 years: feasible? Danielle Paffard of the Centre for Alternative Technology's Zero Carbon Britain project, however, voiced further reservations: \"BECCS isn't useful as a central feature of a climate mitigation strategy, due to the scale of current electricity demand, and requires an enormous reduction of demand to be viable. Any proposal to rely primarily on biomass for baseload electricity generation is never sensible.\" Salter, Haszeldine and Paffard have not seen the draft IPCC mitigation report. In particular, Paffard criticised carbon capture for fossil fuel power plants as a \"red herring\": \"We can't hope to simply run over a carbon precipice and pulls ourselves back. Government targets must be much more ambitious. Our research has shown that we can run modern societies without relying on fossil fuels, and that transitioning to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is technologically and economically feasible with the right approach.\" Despite reservations, Paffard acknowledged a limited but \"very important\" role for BECCS. Other forms of carbon capture such as peatland conversion, biochar, and extensive reforestation will be \"crucial\" for energy transition, she said: \"Biomass does have the potential to be very destructive, but if used sparingly it has a place as part of a wider strategy involving renewables, to create synthetic fuels useful for industry and transport. Bioenergy is important as a flexible backup to address long-term energy storage due to the intermittency and variability of renewable sources - but its use must be sustainable, based on 'second generation' non-food crops [e.g. forest and crop residues, municipal and construction waste], not encroach on land-use for food, and combined with extensive reforestation.\" The IPCC draft report does emphasise the need to dramatically ramp up solar and wind power, pointing out the superior \"technical potential\" of solar compared to other renewables. Economic straitjacket? Dr Smolker of Biofuelwatch, in contrast, said that the IPCC's central emphasis on biofuels with carbon capture is a \"dangerous distraction\" from the task of \"deeply altering our entire relationship to energy consumption.\" She highlighted an unwillingness to recognise the \"fundamental link between 'endless growth economics' and ecological destruction.\" Working Group 3, she said, lacks sufficient expertise to assess the merits of its recommended technologies. Many critical assessments of bioenergy \"come from scientists with a background in ecology and related disciplines and those are barely represented within the IPCC\" - WG3 is staffed largely by economists and engineers: \"The underlying assumption appears to be that business as usual [BAU] economic growth must be sustained, and industry and corporate profits must be protected and maintained. But if we focus on 'BAU economics', seeking and accepting only bargain basement options for addressing global warming - the costs will be far more severe.\" Dr Nafeez Ahmed is executive director of the Institute for Policy Research &amp; Development and author of A User's Guide to the Crisis of Civilisation: And How to Save It among other books.

The bill still has to get through another three days of debate in the Commons, and then it will go to the Lords, but with MPs backing it by such a large margin it now seems certain to clear all its parliamentary stages by the beginning of March. This means Theresa May will be able to trigger article 50 as she plans before the end of that month, starting a two-year process that should lead to the UK being out of the EU before April 2019. Jeremy Corbyn has suffered a serious rebellion, with 20% of his parliamentary party, including 13 serving frontbenchers, defying the whip. (See 8.38pm.) Corbyn has said he understands why MPs representing remain areas found it hard to follow the Labour whip and vote for the bill and party sources are playing down the prospect of mass sackings. But the decision to back the Tories over Brexit has gone down very badly with the party’s activist base, and it is possible that the vote could traumatise the party for years to come, just as the vote for the Iraq war vote did in 2003. Here are highlights from the debate. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. A Conservative party spokesman said this about the vote. Forty seven Labour MPs voting against the article 50 Bill shows Labour can’t speak for themselves, let alone speak for the country. They’re hopelessly divided and can’t even agree whether they should back the Bill to implement the decision taken by the public to leave the EU. What we do know is that they aren’t interested in controlling our own laws or immigration and are completely out of touch with ordinary working people. We’ve found another shadow minister who voted against the bill (Lyn Brown, policing), and so I have updated the post below about the scale of the Labour rebellion and adjusted the figures. (See 8.38pm.) We now have 17 Labour frontbenchers (shadow ministers and whips) either resigned over the vote or defied the whip. The Lib Dem leader Tim Farron put out this statement after the result. The Tories and Labour have failed future generations today by supporting a hard Brexit. Labour’s leadership tonight have waved the white flag. They are not an opposition, they are cheerleaders. The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to give the British people the final say on the deal. The Labour party will not be taking any disciplinary action tonight against the frontbenchers who defied the whip and voted against the article 50 bill (see 8.38pm), ITV’s Chris Ship reports. Jeremy Corbyn has put out this statement about the vote. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: Labour MPs voted more than three to one in favour of triggering article 50. Now the battle of the week ahead is to shape Brexit negotiations to put jobs, living standards and accountability centre stage. Labour’s amendments are the real agenda. The challenge is for MPs of all parties to ensure the best deal for Britain, and that doesn’t mean giving Theresa May a free hand to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven. Here are the key figures that show the size of the Labour rebellion tonight. 47 Labour MPs defied the whip and voted against the article 50 bill on second reading. That’s 20% of the parliamentary party. Three members of the shadow cabinet resigned so that the could vote against the bill. They are: Jo Stevens, the shadow Welsh secretary, Rachael Maskell, the shadow environment secretary, and Dawn Butler, shadow minister for BME communities. Four frontbenchers resigned so they could vote against the bill. They are the three shadow cabinet ministers and Tulip Siddiq, who was shadow early years minister. Another 10 shadow ministers voted against the bill but so far have not resigned. The nine shadow ministers are: Kevin Brennan (culture), Ruth Cadbury (housing), Alan Whitehead (energy), Rupa Huq (crime prevention), Stephen Pound (Northern Ireland), Andy Slaughter (housing), Catherine West (Foreign Office), Daneil Zeichner (transport), Rosena Allin-Khan (culture) and Lyn Brown (policing). And three whips also voted against bull but have so far not resigned. They are Thangam Debonnaire, Vicky Foxcroft and Jeff Smith. A total of 17 Labour frontbenchers (shadow ministers and whips) either resigned over the vote or defied the whip. UPDATE: I’ve updated the paragraph about shadow ministers defying the whip to say there were 10, not nine. The Press Association points out that Lyn Brown, a shadow police minister, voted against the bill. The list I posted earlier, naming all 114 MPs who voted against the article 50 bill getting a second reading, has now been updated so that they are sorted by party. (See 8.03pm.) You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear. This is from the Labour Whips Twitter feed, an official party account. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, did not vote tonight. She was one of the members of the shadow cabinet who was known to be particularly unhappy about the prospect of voting for article 50 but, according to Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh, her office say she was stayed away because she was ill. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has tweeted this about the result. And here is a full list of the 114 MPs who voted against the article 50 bill getting a second reading.

For the bill Conservatives: 319 Labour: 167 DUP: 8 UUP: 2 Ukip: 1 Independent: 1 Total: 498 Against the bill SNP: 50 Labour: 47 Lib Dems: 7 SDLP: 3 Independents: 3 Plaid Cymru: 2 Green: 1 Conservative: 1 Total: 114 On the BBC Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said he does not know what will happen to the Labour frontbenchers who defied the whip. Here are the figures showing how MPs voted on the first vote, the SNP amendment. For the amendment saying the bill should be blocked SNP: 50 Labour: 33 Lib Dems: 7 SDLP: 3 Plaid Cymru: 2 Green: 1 Conservative: 1 Total: 100 Against the amendment Conservatives: 319 DUP: 8 Labour: 6 UUP: 2 Ukip: 1 Total: 336 Here is the result. MPs for the government’s article 50 bill programme motion by 329 votes to 112 - a majority of 217. The programme motion sets aside three days, but no more, for the remaining debates on the bill, meaning it will be ready to go to the Lords by Wednesday night. MPs are now voting on the programme motion. (See 6.30pm.) The tellers are the same as for the last vote: Gavin Williamson, the chief whip, and Jackie Doyle-Price, another government whip, are for the ayes; and the two SNP whips Marion Fellows and Owen Thompson are for the noes. Here is the result. MPs vote for bill giving May the power to trigger article 50 by 498 votes to 114 - a majority of 384. This is from the Sun’s Harry Cole. This is from the BBC’s Iain Watson. This is from the Sun’s Steve Hawkes. For the record, here are the current figures for how many MPs each main party currently has. Conservatives: 329 Labour: 229 SNP: 54 Lib Dems: 9 DUP: 8 This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Dawn Butler’s office has put out a statement about her decision to resign from the shadow cabinet. A spokesperson said: Dawn has said that it was an honour to be a part of the shadow cabinet doing a job that she loves. She could not in good conscience vote for a bill which is just a few lines. Since the referendum Dawn has made it clear to her constituents that she would respect the democratic vote of Brent, which voted 60% to remain. Dawn cannot vote for a bill which she is sure will make her constituents poorer. Following the referendum Dawn was clear that if parliament was presented with a vote on triggering article 50, she would vote against. Last night Dawn held a local residents meeting to discuss the intricacies of the various stages of the article 50 bill and she listened carefully to the views of her constituents. And assured her constituents that the Labour Party will put forward amendments that will improve this shame of a bill. Earlier today Dawn gave the leader of the opposition a full explanation of her position on this matter, which has not changed since the referendum, and she recognises that this stance makes her position on the Labour frontbench untenable and therefore resigned. The Conservative MP Chloe Smith has brought her baby into the chamber as she votes. John Bercow, the speaker, thought she might be hesitant and told her she was free to bring the little one in. This is from the Times’ Patrick Kidd. In the second vote the tellers for the ayes are Gavin Williamson, the chief whip, and Jackie Doyle-Price, another government whip. And the tellers for the noes are Marion Fellows and Owen Thompson, both SNP whips. Labour’s Lilian Greenwood says she will vote against the bill. Earlier in the debate she said she came into the chamber without having fully decided which way she would vote. MPs are now voting on the bill itself. This is the most important of the three votes tonight. See 6.30pm. Here is the result. MPs vote down SNP amendment opposing article 50 bill by 336 votes to 100 - a majority of 236. This, from the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush, helps to explain why this is such a difficult evening for Labour. As does this from ITV’s Chris Ship. This is from the Mirror’s Ben Glaze. The tellers for the ayes are Marion Fellows and Owen Thompson, both SNP whips. And the tellers for the noes are Gavin Williamson, the chief whip, and Jackie Doyle-Price, another government whip. MPs are now voting on the SNP amendment. See 6.30pm. Jones says MPs will have plenty of opportunities to scrutinise the great repeal bill. He says he agrees with Jenny Chapman. The people have made their decision. The government must act not for the 52%, or the 48%, but the 100%. And that’s it. MPs are now voting. Jones is now addressing the role of parliament. The prime minister has said parliament will have the final say on the deal, he says. He says the white paper will be published tomorrow. But it is entirely separate from this bill, he says. Jones says he hopes the UK will continue to have good relations with the EU as they work together on issues like security and immigration. Back in the Commons Jones says EU citizens living in the UK will continue to be welcome in this country, as it assumes Britons will be welcome in other countries. Jeremy Corbyn has put out this statement about the resignations of Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler. He said: I would like to thank Dawn and Rachael for their work in the shadow cabinet. They are great assets to the Labour party and to our movement. MPs have a duty to represent their constituents as well as their party, and I understand the difficulties that MPs for constituencies which voted remain have in relation to the European Union withdrawal bill. However, it is right that the Labour party respects the outcome of the referendum on leaving the European Union. We have said all along that Labour will not frustrate the triggering of Article 50 and to that end we are asking all MPs to vote for the bill at its second reading tonight. I wish both Dawn and Rachael well and look forward to working with them in the future. In the circumstances, that is a very warm letter. It suggests that this vote will not be held against Maskell and Butler for long, and that Corbyn would like them back in the shadow cabinet at some point. David Jones, a Brexit minister, is winding up now for the government. He says this is a simple bill giving the government the power to trigger article 50. It is not a bill to set the terms of the government’s Brexit negotiation. Back in the Commons Chapman says Brexit must work for all communities, especially the most disadvantaged. Labour will do its duty. Quoting FD Roosevelt, she says Labour must be a party of liberal thought, planned action, enlightened international outlook, and one that wants the the greatest good for all citizens. It is not a party just for the 48% who voted to remain, but for everyone, she says. Here is Rachael Maskell’s resignation statement. And here is an excerpt. I have consulted with my constituents and local businesses throughout the process and held a number of meetings for them to voice their opinions, read over one thousand pieces of correspondence just this weekend, and organised two packed emergency meetings on Monday night. I have listened carefully to my constituents, those I am entrusted to represent in Westminster, who voted strongly to Remain in the EU. In voting against the legislation, I am representing the will of my constituents, ensuring their voice is heard in Parliament. When I took the oath of allegiance upon swearing in to Parliament in May 2015, I broke with convention and swore my oath to my constituents first; I will not forget this. I believe that Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan’ is creating an unjustifiable level of risk at a time of national and international uncertainty and volatility, with silence on national security measures, no mention of climate change mitigation or environmental protections, and no guarantee of good jobs or employment rights. Most worrying of all is the rapidly changing social context which is leading to a rise of racism and hate crime in the UK. These are the very things that I have campaigned on all my life and believe are central to Labour’s values. Chapman says the vote for Brexit has deepened the sense that values we cherish, like tolerance, openness and solidarity, are under threat. There is a fear that xenophobia, fear and isolationism are drowning out our values, she says. Bigotry should have no place in our politics. She says there are very few MPs who do not fear about the threat to values we support. Labour will not neglect its duty to challenge the government when it thinks it is getting Brexit wrong. And the best Brexit will never come via a cliff edge, she says. She says Theresa May must get a deal worthy of this House. Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, is winding up now for the opposition. She says what is unusual about this bill is that MPs are voting on a matter which has been the subject of a referendum. The SNP’s Alex Salmond asks if Labour will vote against the “restrictive” programme motion. (See 8.30am.) Chapman says she wants the bill to proceed. Labour is an internationalist, pro-European party. That will never change, she says. The Evening Standard’s Kate Proctor has quotes from Dawn Butler’s resignation letter. Theresa May has now arrived in the chamber for the wind-up speeches. There will be three votes tonight. Here is a guide to what is coming. 7pm: MPs will first vote on the “reasoned amendment” tabled by the SNP. This says that the bill should not get a second reading, and explains why. Here is the full text. That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill as the Government has set out no provision for effective consultation with the devolved administrations on implementing Article 50, has yet to publish a White Paper detailing the Government’s policy proposals, has refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, has left unanswered a range of detailed questions covering many policy areas about the full implications of withdrawal from the single market and has provided no assurance that a future parliamentary vote will be anything other than irrelevant, as withdrawal from the European Union followed two years after the invoking of Article 50 if agreement is not reached in the forthcoming negotiations, unless they are prolonged by unanimity. The amendment has been signed by 66 MPs, mostly from the SNP, but including some MPs from Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SDLP and the Green’s Caroline Lucas. MPs in favour of article 50 will vote against. Around 7.15pm: MPs will then vote on the main motion - to give the article 50 bill a second reading. This is the main vote. The numbers will be much the same as on the first vote, although there may be a few MPs who want to vote against the bill at second reading but who draw the line at supporting an SNP amendment. Around 7.30pm: MPs will then vote for the programme motion. This is the motion that sets a three-day timetable for the debate on the rest of the bill. Without a programme motion the government would not be able to guarantee getting its bill through the Commons on time. Labour MPs are not opposing the programme motion, but there may be more MPs voting against the government on this vote than on the first two. That is because there are some opposition MPs who accept that the bill should go through, but who think more time should be set aside for debate. Dawn Butler has announced that she has resigned from the shadow cabinet so she can vote against the bill. That means, with Rachael Maskell (see 6.11pm) we have had two more Labour frontbench resignations within the last few minutes. Maskell was a full member of the shadow cabinet. Butler was not a full member, but she was on the list of those with a right to attend and was included in statistics about the number of women in the shadow cabinet. Two other frontbenchers (one of whom was in the shadow cabinet) had previously resigned. See 2.59am for more details. The shadow environment secretary Rachael Maskell has announced that she will vote against the bill and that she has resigned from the shadow cabinet. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. Labour’s Owen Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership last year, says he will vote against the bill. He says he thinks it will be his constituents who will suffer from Brexit. But this is not just about economics, he says. He says it is also about values. He believes in internationalism. He does not want to see the UK lining up alongside Donald Trump. He says he stands instead alongside Angela Merkel, who was willing to speak out against Trump. Labour’s Roberta Blackman-Woods has just told MPs that she will abstain tonight. Labour’s Stephen Doughty says he will vote against the bill. His constituency, Cardiff South and Penarth, voted to remain and he will vote in line with their wishes. He says Theresa May claims to be a leader. But she is a follower, following the siren calls of hardline Eurosceptics on her benches. Ben Howlett, a Conservative, says he is giving a speech he never wanted to give. He says he campaigned passionately for remain. And 70% of residents in his constituency, Bath, voted for remain. He says if the UK is to leave the EU, it should get on with it quickly, to reduce uncertainty. He will vote in favour, he says. The SNP’s John Nicolson says he is often asked why the SNP want to share sovereignty with the EU, but not with the UK. It’s a good question. He says pooling sovereignty can have its benefits. But that does not work for Scotland in the UK now, he says. He compares Scotland with Denmark, a country of roughly the same size. He says Denmark is in the EU, but it is better off than Scotland because it has more power over what happens to it. The Conservative Kevin Hollinrake says Labour MPs are demanding a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. But what they seem to want is a veto. And that would be a mistake, he says, because it would give the EU an incentive to offer a poor deal. MPs are now just getting three minutes for their speeches. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says this shows MPs should have been allocated more time. The politics professor Philip Cowley, who is an expert on parliamentary rebellions, says today’s debate and vote will provide a perfect case study for anyone interested in the theory of representative democracy. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says people in the UK should work as if they are in the early days of a Ukip United Kingdom, because that is what the country is turning into under Brexit. Labour’s Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, says up to 100,000 jobs in the City could be at risk from Brexit. That would affect her constituents. And she says it is not just top City jobs that would go. There are many ordinary jobs dependent on financial services, she says. She says she will vote against the bill. Labour’s Mary Creagh has just told MPs that she will vote against the bill. Voting in favour would be against her conscience, against her values and against her DNA, she says. Kevin Schofield at PoliticsHome has an interesting article at PoliticsHome looking at what Jeremy Corbyn might do if Clive Lewis goes ahead with this threat to resign from the shadow cabinet and vote against the article 50 bill at third reading if the government does not accept any of the Labour amendments. Here’s an extract. One well-placed source said: “Corbyn’s team are very irritated with Clive. By resigning, he will get the love and support of all the young lefty members who are appalled at Corbyn’s stance on Article 50.” The Labour leadership are well aware that Lewis - should he make good on his resignation threat - could well become the new standard bearer for the thousands of idealistic activists who have joined the party in the last 18 months, and now feel let down by Jeremy. Some party insiders now believe Team Corbyn could use Lewis’ departure as an opportunity to promote another bright young thing. “I think there’s a good chance they’ll move Rebecca Long-Bailey from shadow chief secretary to shadow business to replace Clive,” says one. “They are really pushing her - it looks like she is now Jeremy’s chosen successor. Shifting her gives her profile plus a platform to build alliances with the trade unions. Back in the Commons Labour’s Stella Creasy says her constituents want employment rights protected and the rights of EU nationals living in the UK protected. She says she cannot approve the government’s plans. She does not want to vote against the opportunities for the future that being in the EU offers. The government must go back to the drawing board, she says. Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will probably come under review by the European court of justice (ECJ) which may ultimately amend the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal, the institution’s most senior judge has said. As the Press Association reports, Theresa May made clear in a speech to the Conservative conference in October that a key priority in Brexit negotiations will be to take the UK out of the jurisdiction of the ECJ. But ECJ president Koen Lenaerts said it was likely that, before the UK leaves, one party or another in the two-year negotiating process will end up seeking the arbitration of the Luxembourg-based court on one of the many contentious subjects involved. Prof Lenaerts told the Reuters news agency that even “a lawyer with the wildest imagination” would not be able to anticipate precisely how the court would become involved in the Brexit debate. He added: It probably will, one day or another, end up on the docket of the court - not because of the court, but because of parties bringing the case. The SNP’s Hannah Bardell says she has recently seen Trainspotting 2 and she uses a parody of the “Choose life” monologue to mock the Brexiteers. (It doesn’t quite come off, partly because some MPs don’t seem to know what she is on about.) The BBC’s Mark D’Arcy has written an interesting blog with five take-outs from the debate so far. Labour’s Adrian Bailey says he will reluctantly vote for the bill. He thinks that, having had a referendum, it would be bad for democracy if MPs ignored the result. But he says his result does not mean he is committing himself to accepting the final result. He reserves the right to vote against the deal Theresa May obtains later. Labour’s Seema Malhotra says she will accept the result of the referendum and vote in favour of the bill. But she urges Theresa May to set up a national convention so that local government leaders and others can contribute to the debate about what kind of Brexit the country wants. I’ve been beefing up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes. You may need to refresh the page to get them to appear. The Conservative MP Bob Neill says he will vote for the bill. But he says the vote promised by the prime minister on the final deal must be a meaningful one. And MPs must get a vote before the European parliament votes on it. At the afternoon lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman was asked to respond to what George Osborne said about Theresa May not making the economy her Brexit priority. (See 1.39pm.) This is from Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh. Daniel Zeichner, the Labour MP and a shadow transport minister, says he will vote against Brexit. He is against it, his constituents are against it (he is MP for Cambridge), and he will not be moved. I’m fortunate that my personal, long and strongly-held views align with the three quarters of my constituents who voted remain. I will therefore be voting against the triggering of article 50 by whatever route someone is empowered to it - royal prerogative, referendum result, prime ministerial diktat, whatever. I’m against it, my constituents are against it and I will not be moved from that. He says his father came to the UK as a refugee fleeing the Nazis and he says the EU has been a force for peace. The Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth asks him if he accepts that the unemployment generated by Eurozone policies has made Europe less stable. Zeichner says he does not accept that. The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who was shadow environment secretary until she resigned last summer, has put a statement on her website explaining why she will be voting against the article 50 bill tonight. Here is an excerpt. At this point, however, we are not voting on the Brexit deal, i.e. the terms on which we will leave the EU. This vote is on whether the UK is ready to trigger article 50, which then gives us two years to negotiate our withdrawal. As far as we know – although there is a court case pending – this process is not reversible. I do not believe we are ready to trigger article 50 and I do not believe it would be right for me to vote to do so tonight. It would not be in my constituents’ interests and nor would it be in the interests of the country. Labour called upon the prime minister to publish a clear plan, in the form of a white paper, before triggering, but she has not done so. There is no clarity on any of the key issues, and I have no confidence that the government will be able to negotiate the sort of trade deals they talk about - we will not be in a strong position; in fact, as the prime minister’s recent visit to see president Trump suggests, we will be somewhat desperate to conclude a deal ... It is also worth noting that we have elections in France and Germany this year, and it seems to me there is little logic in triggering article 50, when we will not be able to start negotiations in any meaningful sense until those elections are over. Labour’s Chris Bryant says he is a democrat. But he believes in a form of democracy that accepts the rights of minority opinion as well as majority opinion. That is why he will be voting against the bill, he says. I am a democrat but I believe in the form of democracy that never silences minorities and I think the 48% in this country have a right to a voice and for that matter the 46% or the 45% or whatever the actual figure was in my constituency. Today I’m afraid I am voting and speaking on behalf of a minority of my constituents .. In the end there is no point in any single one of us being a member of this House if we don’t have things that we believe in and that we are prepared to fight for and, if necessary, lay down our job for. The Labour MP Madeline Moon says she does not trust the government to take the country to the right place. She will vote against the bill. Another Welsh Labour MP, Kevin Brennan, also told MPs that he would vote against the bill. Labour’s Mike Gapes says that, by triggering article 50 early, the government will be putting the UK on an escalator it will not be able to get off. It should have waited until the Irish court case determines whether or not article 50 is reversible, he says. The problem with the position taken by both front benches by triggering early, we are going to be on an escalator in one direction with no ability to get off. We need to not be on this escalator. We need to have a means to stop that process and that’s why we need clarity before we start triggering it. The Green MP Caroline Lucas has written an article for Guardian Comment criticising Labour’s tactics over the bill. Here is an extract. By promising early on that they would vote unconditionally to trigger article 50, the Labour party has capitulated to the government, as well as reduced its bargaining position on the things they want to secure from the bill. Labour’s amendments to the detailed content of the bill represent important safeguards against an extreme Brexit but their strategy of unconditional support delivered via a three-line whip, removes all incentive for the government to negotiate and thereby undermines their best chance of securing the changes we all want. And here is the article. The Labour MP Jim Dowd says he will vote for the SNP amendment and against the article 50 bill. He says he will not be complicit in something he knows to be wrong. And he is worried that many MPs will be voting for something that they do know to be a mistake. I will not be complicit in something that I know and feel to be wrong, and to be against the best interests of not just my constituents, and not just the city of which my constituency is a small part, but this country and all its people. Tulip Siddiq, who resigned as a shadow early years minister last week so she could vote against the bill, tells MPs that she cannot vote for the bill because that would not be in the interests of her constituents. The reason why I’m taking the stand I’m taking is because, in Hampstead and Kilburn, we do not wince when we hear people speak in a different language on public transport. We do not blame the very real pressures on our health system, on our criminal justice and on our housing by scapegoating others, just because they do not look like us and because they do not sound like us. In Hampstead and Kilburn, we do not indulge in baseless theories that our country is at breaking point. Siddiq is one of two shadow ministers who have already resigned ahead of this vote. The other is Jo Stevens, who was in the shadow cabinet (unlike Siddiq) and who resigned as shadow Welsh secretary. But there is speculation that there could be further resignations later. As my colleague Rowena Mason says, some shadow cabinet ministers have not yet said how they will vote. Other Labour frontbenchers, including at least three whips (these two, and this one), have said they will vote against the bill, defying orders from the party. It is not clear yet whether junior frontbenchers will be sacked if they go against the whip. In normal circumstances that is what would happen, but Jeremy Corbyn has said that he understands why MPs representing pro-remain constituencies may find it hard backing the bill. Here is the latest Guardian story about the prospective Labour revolt. And here is a New Statesman tally of Labour MPs likely to vote against the bill. Nadine Dorries, the pro-leave Conservative, criticised David Cameron for trying to get Paul Dacre sacked as editor of the Daily Mail. Graham Allen, the Labour MP, said parliament should be voting to trigger article 50. But it should only do so after MPs have exercised “due diligence” and scrutinised the government’s plans properly, he said. He also said MPs should be prepared to ignore the abuse directed at them on social media for the stance they take on Brexit. Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP who chairs the international trade committee, says that no one knows what sort of trade relations the UK will have after Brexit. He says only six members of the UN do not have regional trade arrangements. The UK will be going where even North Korea does not dare to go, he says. We are like someone who smashed up a Rolls-Royce and then goes to a second-hand car dealer to ask for a suitable replacement, he says. People assume the House of Commons knows what it’s doing. It doesn’t. It’s crossing its fingers and hoping for the best .. The best deal for the UK is after smashing up the Rolls-Royce. The best deal, we have it now, we have it with Europe. Now we are going to head down to a second hand car dealer and ask him for the best motor he has got because we have smashed up our Rolls-Royce. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative former education secretary, says parliament must be involved in the Brexit process. She says she hopes the government will say more about how this might happen, perhaps in the wind-up speech from the front bench tonight. The Labour MP Neil Coyle said he would oppose the bill. He said that Labour members opposed Brexit and they deserved something better from the Labour front bench. It should not just be accepting the government’s position, he said. Former prime minister John Major referred to the like of the former secretary of state for work and pensions as bastards. He could not have known that his party would become a whole government full of bastards who are absolutely causing economic damage for my constituents and for the whole country. At the risk of offending my own front bench as well as the government front bench, I say this - my members campaigned vigorously to remain in the European Union and they deserve a front bench position that is not to sign up to the government’s position, the government’s timetable and the government curtailing debate. It is a disgrace. Alistair Burt, the Conservative former Foreign Office minister, said that he opposed Brexit. But he told constituents that he would accept the result of the referendum, and so he will back the bill, he said. He also said that he would not be then campaigning for the UK to rejoin the EU in the future. He said Europe had divided the Conservative party for long enough, creating bitterness, and that he wanted the party not to have to face “the blight of this argument dogging them, their associations and their members and voters the same way it has dogged us”. The Conservative former minister Sir Gerald Howarth told MPs this was a historic day. Parliament would be sovereign again, he said. He also said Margaret Thatcher’s response to this bill would have been: “Rejoice!” (Howarth was her parliamentary private secretary.) The Labour MP Ian Murray said he would be voting against the bill. He said he wanted to be able to look his constituents in the eye and say he had done everything he could to stop Brexit. It’s with a heavy heart that I will vote against triggering article 50. But I will do so in the knowledge that I can walk down the streets of Edinburgh South and look at my constituents in the eye, and say to them I’ve done everything I possibly can to protect their jobs, livelihoods and the future for their family.

The Northern Ireland affairs select committee has been told by two customs lawyers with decades of experience of border controls that the continuing free movement of goods is legally impossible if the UK quits the Customs Union in a hard Brexit. Retired customs trade lawyer Michael Lux, who worked for the German ministry of finance, has said Theresa May can do what she likes once the UK leaves the European Union but that Ireland Taoiseach Enda Kenny will have to apply EU law with no choice but to have customs checks on the border. He said: If Northern Ireland is no longer part of the customs union, Ireland is obliged to apply all these rules, what is done on the UK side if it’s outside the EU they can do what they want. His two hours of evidence drew audible gasps from MPs as he told how every vehicle carrying goods worth more than €300 crossing from Ireland into Northern Ireland would have to be stopped, even if only “for a few minutes” and checked. Every driver would have to have an “export declaration” document before travel which would have to be cross-checked by a human being at a border check. “It is important to understand, it isn’t just about customs, it is also about VAT and excise on alcohol and cigarettes,” he said. Dux, who has 40 years experience in customs trade law, told how dogs taken for a walk from south of the border would need documentation as would horses being ridden for pleasure on the border region. This is currently the case on the German/Swiss border, he said. His comments do not bode well for May and Kenny who have warned that a return to the checkpoints of the past could imperil the fragile peace in the region. Asked by Lady Hermon what he thought of Theresa May’s comments this week in Dublin when she said she wanted a “seamless, frictionless border”, Dux replied: “Well these are nice words but what does that mean?” Even if the export declaration paperwork was electronic, a customs official would still be required to check the reference number for the freight and declare the “export movement closed” he said. Lux told how cross-border customs charges and possible tariffs could be the death-knell for cross-border dairy production. Medium-sized businesses might need two people to do the administration, or they could use an agent which would charge typically between €50 and €80 per consignment for an export declaration number, explained Lux. Even if shrewd businesses got the cost of the export declaration document down to €20, the cost of continually moving milk and milk products back and forth would be prohibitive, Lux said. Asked if Northern Ireland could get a “waiver” from the EU because of the special conditions pertaining to the island, lawyer Eric Pickett, an expert in World Trade Organisation rules and international trade law, said this was legally impossible. “It would be a strict violation of WTO law,” he said. As the debate goes on I will be updating some earlier posts, to include direct quotes from speeches initially just covered in reported speech. To get these to appear you may need to refresh the page. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative former environment secretary, said it was important for the government to recognise the role played by foreign workers in agriculture. She said it was important for the government to ensure farmers could still hire foreign labour after Brexit. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said the Lib Dems were a fiercely internationalist party. People may have voted for Brexit, but they did not vote for a destination, he said. That was why it was important to have a second referendum. The prime minister has made her choice. She has chosen hard Brexit. But if you are so confident that what you are planning is what people voted for, then you must give them a vote on the final deal. What started with democracy must not end up with a government stitch-up. Both the Labour front bench and the Conservatives don’t want to give the British people their say; they think they know better. It is an arrogance. It is anti-democratic and that is why Liberal Democrats are fighting for the British people to have a final vote on the deal that the government negotiates. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, told MPs in her speech that she would vote for the bill, even though she backed remain. She said voting against the bill would make it harder to defend faith in democracy. I think the challenge that we will face over the next few years in many European countries is how we defend those democratic values. For me in my constituency, that will be much harder to defend that faith in democracy if we ignore the results of the ballot box last summer. John Whittingdale, the Conservative former culture secretary, said he had hoped that David Cameron would return from his EU renegotiation with plans for proper reform of the EU. Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour former Treasury minister, said, having given the public a referendum, MPs had to accept the result. But he said it was important to get a soft Brexit, and a transitional deal. Anything else would lead to a harsh outcome, he said. Here is the key quote from George Osborne’s speech. (See 1.12pm.) He said that German and French political leaders have told him they are not interested in offering the UK a complex, hybrid agreement. The government has chosen not to make the economy the priority in this negotiation ... The European Union is not prioritising the economy either in these negotiations. Having spent the last couple of weeks in Berlin and in Paris talking to some of the French and German political leaders, it is absolutely clear that while they understand that Britain is a very important market for their businesses, their priority is to maintain the integrity of the remaining 27 members of the European Union. They are not interested in a long and complex, hybrid agreement with the United Kingdom. So therefore both sides at the moment are heading for a clean break from the European Union for the United Kingdom. And the only thing, I think, in the end the negotiation will come down to is how that break is achieved. Caroline Johnson, the new MP for Sleaford, has just given her maiden speech in the debate, backing the bill and backing Brexit. She said: As someone new to the world of Westminster, the greatest surprise to me was that so many seemed surprised by the result of this referendum. I was brought up to believe that a good democracy is ruled by the majority, with protection for minorities. As I talked to my constituents, however, I increasingly understand that they perceive we are ruled by a vocal, minority elite, who are disregarding the views of the majority - and they’re angry. Why is this important? Because so many seem to have been surprised by the Brexit vote, because they failed to understand the genuine concerns of the majority. John Bercow, the speaker, has just announced that 80 MPs still want to speak. He is imposing a four-minute time-limit on speeches, he says. Salmond says if Theresa May is determined to throw down the gauntlet to Nicola Sturgeon over Brexit, she can be sure that Sturgeon will pick it up. Salmond says Sturgeon is serious about her threat to hold a second independence referendum if May takes Scotland out of the single market. Salmond says Scotland has a great history. William Wallace was put in trial in Westminster Hall. He says he hopes he gets a pardon soon too. He says the Scottish government put forward a plan to keep Scotland in the single market. If Ireland can have a frictionless border with the UK, Scotland can have one with England too, he says. Salmond says the Tory 2015 manifesto is not his bedtime reading. But on page 72 it says the Tories say yes to the single market, he says. He says he debated Brexit with the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan during the campaign. Hannan told him no one was talking about leaving the single market, he says. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minster, is speaking now. He says it is good to follow George Osborne. Osborne speeches don’t come cheap now, he says. He says Ken Clarke said yesterday Theresa May was going down the hole like Alice in Wonderland. But Alice only took herself down the hole; May is taking everyone else, he says. My honourable friend ... asked me yesterday if I could remember in the last 30 years in this place of a time the House was gripped by collective madness. That time obviously was Iraq, when this House was mesmerised by a strong prime minister into the blood and disaster of the Iraqi war. But it’s certainly not mesmerising rhetoric that’s responsible for mad MP disease in this case. The right honourable member for Rushcliffe [Ken Clarke] yesterday compared it to Alice in Wonderland. But Alice only took herself into the hole. This prime minister is taking virtually all of the Tory party, half the Labour party and the entire country into the hole. It is politically crazy, what is being done. Osborne says the Brexit negotiations will be “rather bitter”. He spent four years negotiating with Michel Barnier, he says. He says he would advice David Davis to pack some Pro Plus, because there will be long nights. He says issues are going to come to parliament which will divide MPs sharply, including MPs from the same party. We are already seeing divisions over free trade. And there will be arguments about agricultural subsidies, and immigration, and state aid. He says he will be in those fights in the years ahead. Osborne hints he will fight any attempt by the government in future years to adopt protectionist policies. Osborne says the government has chosen not to make the economy the priority in the Brexit negotiations. Instead it has prioritised immigration control and escaping the jurisdiction of the ECJ. He says the economy will not be the priority for the rest of the EU either. Having spoken to EU leaders recently, he has learnt their priority it maintaining the EU. He says they are not interested in giving the UK a complex deal. Instead, they want a simple break. Osborne says EU leaders not interested in giving UK a complex deal. The negotiation will be a trade off, like all divorces, between access and money. George Osborne, the former chancellor, is speaking now. He says democracy is easy to defend when it produces results you like. It is harder to defend when it produces results you do not like. He says he fought hard for the UK to stay in the EU. He sacrificed his position in government in this case. He is a passionate believer in having an open democracy. But he is also passionate about democracy. Britain has helped to spread democracy around the word. That is why he will be voting for the bill. We have given the modern world a version of democracy that has spread far beyond our shores. And therefore to vote against the majority verdict of the largest democratic exercise in British history I think would risk putting Parliament against people, I think it would provoke a deep constitutional crisis in our country, I think it would alienate people who already feel they are alienated, and I am not prepared to do that. So I will be voting for the bill tonight. Miliband says he thinks the UK will be weaker internationally outside the EU. He says when he was climate change minister, he saw how the UK’s influence was increased by being a member of the EU. He says he accepts Theresa May’s argument that Brexit means Brexit. But he does not see why Brexit should mean Trump. I can go along with the prime minister that Brexit means Brexit but I cannot go along with the idea that Brexit means Trump. And nor do I believe that is inevitable and nor do I believe that is what the British people want either. The danger is this, the prime minister feels it is an inevitable consequence of the decision to leave the EU that we are driven into the arms of president Trump. In her Lancaster House speech, May set out her objectives. But they did not include maximising international cooperation, he says. He says the UK should be collaborating with its EU allies. Where has the coordinated EU response to the Trump travel ban been, he asks. He says he is glad Britons have an exemption. So does Canada, New Zealand and Australia. But he says EU countries are not covered. The UK should be standing in solidarity with them. Miliband says UK should be fighting for EU countries to get exemption from Trump travel ban. Ed Miliband is speaking now. He did not want a referendum, he says. He opposed calls for one in the last parliament. But he said he would accept the result of the referendum. And so he will vote for the bill tonight. He says MPs should not let people who may have voted for Brexit because they felt ignored think they are being ignored again. Part of the reason why I’ll be voting the way I will tonight is I think this referendum in part stemmed from a deep frustration about politics and the sense of disaffection from politics that there is in the country. Therefore I think a heightened reason for saying that this process must begin is we do not want to give the sense that people, having voted for Brexit because they felt they’d been ignored, are being ignored once again. But he says the government should not go into Brexit without an analysis of what it might mean. He says there must be a meaningful vote in the Commons on the outcome. Theresa May is just offering a “take it or leave it” option, he says, meaning MPs would have to accept the deal, or see the UK leave the EU on WTO terms. He says he hopes MPs will back the amendment calling for a meaningful vote. Labour’s Rupa Huq says there may be a “crock of something” at the end of Brexit, but that it won’t necessarily be gold. Miliband agrees. John Bercow, the speaker, starts by saying there will be an eight-minute time limit on speeches for backbenchers. He calls the first speaker, Ed Milband, the former Labour leader. I missed the questions from Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, because I was writing up the snap summary. Here are his questions. He started by asking how Theresa May would ensure the land border with Ireland stays open after Brexit. Given that people will be watching this not just in Britain but also in Ireland, would she take the opportunity now to say how she will deliver these sensible and important outcomes? May said she wanted the border to be “as frictionless as possible:. These are absolutely the outcomes that we want to see. I was very pleased to meet with the Taoiseach and discuss the joint intent to ensure we don’t see a return to the borders of the past. We focus on the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; of course, the issue of movements from Ireland affects ports in Wales and, of course, Stranraer. We have agreed the work we’re going to do to deliver what I believe will be as frictionless as possible a border. Robertson then used his second question to suggest that this meant the SNP’s plan for Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK left, migth be feasible. He said: The prime minister has very helpfully explained that it is perfectly possible for parts of these islands to be in the single market, with free movement of people and at the same time protect and enhance trade with one another. This is very, very welcome, Mr Speaker. But May did not accept this interpretation. Following the meeting of the JMC plenary sessions we did agree to an intensification of discussions. He really should listen to the answers that are given because he’s trying to imply something that isn’t there. We’re very clear we want to see a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic ... but I’m also clear another negotiation is to see as frictionless a border as possible with the EU ... and if he wants that, he shouldn’t want to take Scotland out of the EU by becoming independent. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Labour’s Naz Shah asks about a female constituent lured to Pakistan and killed. Will the government encourage Pakistan to ensure that justice is done? May says two people have been arrested and charged in Pakistan in connection with this case. The SNP’s Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh asks if the government will stand up for refugees, wherever they come from? And does she accept the right of women to wear the hijab? May says women should be free to wear the hijab. What a woman wears is a woman’s choice, she says. And she says the government is opposed to discriminating against refugees on the grounds of religion. Labour’s John Woodcock asks what the government is doing to ensure that the proposed Moorside nuclear power station remains on track. He says Toshiba is reviewing its commitment to this. May says the government remains committed to this. Nigel Adams, a Conservative, asks about the impact of the 2015 floods on Tadcaster. May says she is glad the Tadcaster bridge has reopened. John Bercow, the speaker, says the Lib Dems are here now, and he calls Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, to ask a question. Farron does not seem to be expecting this. He says the Lib Dems are doing the job that Labour should be doing, opposing the government on Brexit. May will come back with a Brexit deal. Who should agree it? Parliament, the government or the people? He thinks it should be the people. May says she has already said MPs will get a vote. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says the Lib Dems asked for extra time for the article 50 bill to be debated, but they were not there last night as it was being debated. May says she has fought the Lib Dems all her career, and nothing they do surprises her. The decision for MPs tonight is do they trust the people. May says there is a committee that will look at whether Sir Philip Green will lose his knighthood. It is waiting for the results of the investigation into BHS to conclude. Labour’s Stephen Hepburn says the association of directors of adult social care says £4.6bn has been cut from adult social care since 2010. Does the government accept responsibility? May says there is a longer-term issue here. The government wants a sustainable solution to social care. Labour ducked this for 13 years, she says. Labour’s Ruth Cadbury says air quality in London has recently been worse than in Beijing. So will the government shelve the plans to double the capacity of the M4? May says the government does want to do more to improve air quality. Alec Shelbroke, a Conservative, asks what May is doing to ensure that other Nato countries spend more on defence. May says the government has been pressing for this for some time. She agrees with President Trump that other countries need to do more. She will continue to raise this with other countries. May says Turkey is an important country to the UK, both in terms of security and because of its role in the migration crisis. She says she made it clear in her press conference in Turkey that she expected the country to uphold human rights. May announces the government’s Brexit white paper will be published tomorrow. Snap PMQs verdict: Strong and effective performances from Corbyn and May. Corbyn started with a superb, short zinger, and for the first four questions of the exchanges, as he quizzed May over Trump, he clearly had the upper hand. He asked a good question on the NHS and a UK-US trade deal too, but May was able to knock this back with a reply that was convincing rhetorically, if not necessarily technically and legally. (What on earth does “the NHS is not for sale” actually mean?) May only really got the better of Corbyn with her final answer, when she powerfully accused Corbyn of leftish grandstanding and of being not able to accept the realpolitik necessity of maintaining cordial relations with someone like Donald Trump. This is key to how she sees herself, while Corbyn rates ideological integrity much more. So both of them will be pleased with how PMQs turned out. Corbyn says he wrote to the PM about this. He holds in his hand her piece of paper (a discreet Neville Chamberlain reference.) She does not mention the convention in it. On trade, will May rule out opening up the NHS to US companies. May says she could give a complex answer. But a simple answer is required. The NHS is not for sale and never will be. Corbyn says he hopes that means US companies cannot come here. Trump has torn up international deals on trade and climate change, he has defended torture and demeaned women. What more does he have to do for his state visit to cancelled? May says Corbyn’s policy has been to insult our most important allies. Would he have been able to get a deal protecting British citizens? Would he have been able to get a commitment on Nato? No. He is leading a protest, but she is leading a country, she says. Corbyn asks why May refused three times on Saturday to condemn the ban. May says she has said it is wrong. Corbyn says May says the US is responsible for its policy on refugees. But surely we all have to defend the 1951 convention on refugees. Why did she not speak out? May says the UK has a proud policy on refugees. Some 10,000 Syrian refugees have come to the UK since the conflict began. She has said the policy is wrong. Jeremy Corbyn also denounces the attack in Quebec. And he pays tribute to Dalyell, who he says doggedly fought to expose official wrong-doing and cover-ups. Dalyell made this House a better place. And he recommends his autobiography, called The Importance of Being Awkward. Corbyn says last week May says she was not afraid to speak frankly to the US president. “What happened?” May says, given the number of resignations Corbyn has had, some of his colleagues have read Dalyell’s book. She says in the US she was able to build on our relationship with our most important allies. And she got some important commitments, especially on Nato. Corbyn says No 10 has not denied May was told about the travel ban. Did she try to persuade Trump otherwise. May says the government is clear that policy is “divisive and wrong”. As home secretary she never did that. She says she did not have advance notice of the restriction on refugees, or on the fact that UK citizens might be affected by the ban. But we all had advance notice of the other aspect of the ban, because Trump spoke about it during the campaign. What matters is how you respond? The government is protecting the interests of the British citizens. Peter Heaton-Jones, a Conservative, asks about a hospital closure in north Devon. He wants to be able to say the Tories are the party of the NHS. May says the government wants people to have the best possible health care. There are concerns about the future of the north Devon hospital. But there are no specific plans for it at the moment. Theresa May starts by offering condolences to those killed in the gun attack in Canada. And she offers condolences to the relatives of Tam Dalyell, who died last week. PMQs is about to start. Sir Ivan Rogers’ evidence on Brexit has been fascinating. It is probably one of the most revealing select committee hearings we’ve had on this topic since the referendum. Here are the key points. Rogers said that EU leaders will demand that the UK pays a huge price for leaving the EU. They could demand that the UK pays a sum between €40bn and €60bn, he said. He said that he does not know any EU leaders who think the UK will be able to sign a trade deal with the EU until well after 2020. Speaking about the memo he send to Number 10 on this he said: My summary of the senior beltway wisdom of the people I spoke to on a daily basis was that it would probably take until the early to mid-2020s for ratification. I have not found a single senior person in any of those organs who has diverged from that view. But he said he never said it would take 10 years to get a deal, and he thought it might be possible to go “much faster”. He insisted he did not leak his advice to the BBC, or to anyone else. I never leak, I never have, I never would. I can categorically deny and rebut that. He implied the leak came from Downing Street. He said he did not think the EU would agree transitional deals in stages. The EU would not agree sector-specific transitional deals until the overall transitional deal is sort, he said. He said the Brexit talks would descend into “name-calling” and “fist-fighting” (although he was being metaphorical when he spoke of fist-fighting.) He said the Brexit negotations would be a “humongous” task. [This will be] an unprecedentedly large negotiation covering large tracts of Whitehall ... on a scale we haven’t experienced probably ever and certainly since the Second World War ... This is going to be on a humongous scale. We are going to have enormous amounts of business running up various different channels and then involve difficult trade-offs for Her Majesty’s government and difficult trade-offs for the other 27 on the other side of the table. He said the UK could negotiate trade deals more quickly outside the EU, but that ti would have less clout. One of the key cases for leaving is the nimbleness and agility we would have (when) not a member state, on our own, to negotiate at speed with only our own priorities on the table. I have no doubt that we will negotiate FTAs (free trade agrements) with other partners outside the EU faster than the EU can do it. No doubt at all. The question is then the negotiating heft you have at the table in comparison with being part of a wider bloc. The advantage of being in the EU is not speed or nimbleness .... it is the size of the market. Why are the Canadians or South Koreans or others interested in the EU market? It’s the size and scale. He said he expected details of the Brexit negotiations to be copiously leaked. He said he was not not to blame for getting Cameron to downgrade his ambitions for his EU renegotiation. He said after the EU referendum Whitehall stopped focusing properly on day-to-day EU business. The Daily Mirror has also got a good summary of 11 things we’ve learnt from what it calls a “bombshell” evidence session. Rogers says that David Cameron’s conclusion about it being impossible to get a UK opt-out from free movement being impossible if the UK remained in the single market is one that Theresa May has also accepted. Labour’s Kate Hoey goes next. Q: In the period before the referendum, did you ever tell other EU countries there was a real chance the UK might vote to leave? Rogers says he said repeatedly that he thought the chances of the UK voting to leave were 50/50. He became notorious for that. Some people did not think the Conservatives would win a majority in the general election. But he said they might, and he said that if they did they would hold a referendum and that people might vote to leave. He says he said there was a “very, very serious risk” that the referendum would be lost. He said in parts of Number 10 people were much more sanguine. Some people thought the referendum would be won comfortably. Q: Did you tell the prime minister he might be wrong? Roger says he cannot talk about his advice to the prime minister. He did not know what would be in the Conservative manifesto. He says some people have accused him of downgrading what the prime minister hoped to achieve in the renegotiation. He rejects that claim. He says the ambitions for the renegotiation were set politically. Rogers says he was not to blame for getting Cameron to downgrade his ambitions for his EU renegotiation. Rogers says other EU countries are trying to include things in EU directives now that they know will cause difficulty for the UK. Whitehall has had a lot to do on Brexit, he says. He says in the six months after the referendum he saw Whitehall paying less attention to day-to-day EU business. He has officials telling him they were getting no instructions from London about what position they should be taking on routine EU business. He says he said that was not good enough. He told people in London that the government had to be able to “walk and chew gum” at the same time. Rogers says after the EU referendum Whitehall stopped focusing properly on day-to-day EU business. Rogers says at the EU other countries are now less willing to listen to what the UK wants, because they know it will be leaving. Here is some Twitter comment on Sir Ivan Rogers’ evidence. From Politico Europe’s Charlie Cooper From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes From the BBC’s Vicki Young Q: How robustly is the UK engaging in EU working groups at the moment? Very robustly, says Rogers. He says this did not change after the referendum. Q: How easy will it be to arrange a transitional deal? Rogers says the appetite for a bespoke, interim deal will be limited. The EU may push for transitional arrangements that would be wholly unacceptable. He says some leave campaigners have raised this prospect. He cites Richard North and his “flexit” idea. Rogers says he does not think the EU will agree sector-specific transitional deal until the whole thing is sorted. Rogers says EU not likely to agree transitional deals bit by bit. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP, goes next. Q: How legally binding are our financial obligations? If we don’t pay, will the EU take us to court? Rogers says he does not know how EU figures have come up with the €40bn and €60bn figures. But he can guess, he says. It is based on EU liabilities. That would produce a figure for Britain to pay of between €25bn to €30bn. Then there are other components, like unfunded EU pensions liabilities. Q: Are we liable for pensions? Rogers says this would be a complex question. But he can imagine how the other EU states would say the UK’s liabilities do not cease, particularly in relation to the period when the UK was a member. Rogers says there is a legal question. You do not have to be too cynical to see how the EU lawyers and the UK lawyers may come to a different view. They can reach a compromise. Or one side could walk. Or there could be a political solution. Here is the start of the Press Association story about Sir Ivan Rogers’ evidence. Negotiations to leave the European Union are likely to descend into “name-calling” and “fist-fighting” before any agreement can be found, the UK’s former ambassador to the EU has warned. Sir Ivan Rogers, who quit in January after telling Prime Minister Theresa May that Brussels diplomats thought it might take 10 years to reach a deal, said there was a “humongous” amount of work to do in what would probably be the country’s largest ever negotiation. Sir Ivan told the House of Commons European scrutiny committee that he did not leak his advice to May, which sensationally became public ahead of a key European council summit in December. “I never leak, I never have, I never would,” said the diplomat. “I can categorically deny and rebut that.” Sir Ivan denied that he had ever said that he personally believed a post-Brexit trade deal would take 10 years. But he said his private memo to May detailed the “street wisdom among the senior players” in Brussels and EU capitals, who thought trade negotiations would not start until late 2017 at the earliest and would not be concluded and ratified until the “early-mid 2020s”. Labour’s Graham Stringer is asking questions now. Stringer voted leave. Q: The more I listen to you, the more I think we should leave now. What would you say to MPs who think we should leave without a deal? Rogers says you have to took at the “real-world consequences” of leaving without a deal. People object to the fact that the EU has become something different from what it was in 1973. That is “indubitably” the case, he says. But he would say you cannot just cut the strings on something tied up so closely with UK life carefully. And you have to look at what the ‘default to WTO terms’ would mean. He understands why people want Brexit now. But the issue is how to minimise the costs and disturbances. You should look at what would happen sector by sector, he says. Look at aviation, or medicine, or pharmaceuticals. He says a lot of single market access depends upon trade being certified by bodies that the UK will not recognise after Brexit. So access to the single market will automatically lapse without new agreements. For example, medicines authorised by EU bodies will not be able to go on sale after Brexit without that authorisation. If the UK walks away without a deal, and is reliant on WTO terms, you need to understand what that means. Back in the European scrutiny committee Rogers says that, if the Trump administration rules out trade deals with blocs like the EU, that could lead to tensions, because the EU might resent the UK getting special treatment. But we are not at that point yet, he says. Elsewhere in the Commons Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is giving evidence to the international trade committee. As my colleague Dan Roberts reports, Fox started by taking a swipe at the former cabinet secretary, Gus O’Donnell, who has said publicly that setting up the new department was a mistake. Rogers is now setting out what would happen if the UK gave up single market membership. City firms would not have passporting rights, he says. That would matter more to some than to others. Then there is a question about whether they can rely on “equivalence” instead. But that is capricious and incomplete, he says, and “equivalence” can be withdrawn quite quickly by the 27 EU states. That is a big worry for City firms. If it were to be withdrawn quickly, that would create a big problem. So financial institutions will want a mutual recognition agreement that gives more certainty, and gives both sides some imput. But this could be difficult, he says. He says the UK should be looking for something unprecedented from the EU, a “deeper” free trade agreement, which benefits the financial services industry, but which also benefits the 27. Rogers says he has heard Angela Merkel says repeatedly over the years that the four freedoms of the EU - freedom of movement for goods, capital, services and workers - cannot be unpicked. Rogers says the UK will have exploded a bomb under the EU’s seven-year budget plan when it leaves. That is why getting the UK to pay a price for Brexit is so important to EU leaders, he says. Q: EU leaders are briefing that the UK will be required to pay billions when it leaves. Is that a real threat, or is it unreasonable? Rogers says it can be both. He thinks Barnier and other EU leaders think the UK should have to pay between €40bn and €60bn. He says it remains to be seen whether they will stick to these figures. But money will be an issue, he says. Rogers says EU will demand that UK pays a multi-billion euro price to leave the EU. Rogers accepts that one option for the UK would be just to walk away. But other EU leaders think the UK will not just walk away because the consequences would be so “unpalatable”, he says. Rogers says EU leaders do not believe UK would walk away from EU without a Brexit deal. Rogers says the EU will not be able to draw up a withdrawal treaty unless it knows where the UK is heading. So he thinks the EU will have to negotiate the UK’s withdrawal, and a future trade deal, at the same time. But Michel Barnier, the European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, wants to negotiate UK withdrawal first, and then the free trade agreement. Rogers says others in the EU think this too. So the first argument will be about whether to negotiate these two matters together, or separately. Rogers says he has no doubt that the UK will be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries more quickly than the EU. But there is also an issue about how much negotiating “heft” the UK would have on its own, he says. Q: Did you really say getting a trade deal could take 10 years? Rogers says he never said getting a trade deal with the EU would take 10 years. But what he did say was that if you spoke to senior people in Brussels and other EU capitals, they say a trade deal will be a single negotiation, it will start late in 2017 and that previous free trade agreements negotiated by the EU have taken “an awful lot of time”. So he told government that his summary of talks to “beltway people” was that the whole process would probably take to the early or mid 2020s. He says he did not use the term 10 years. But he was reporting what key people said to him. That was his job as an ambassador. He has not found a single person in a senior position saying something different. He says he has argued it could happen faster. But the “consensus wisdom” amongst the Brussels bureaucracy was that it could not all happen quickly. Rogers says all senior EU figures he has spoken to think the EU will not be able to agree a trade deal with the UK before 2020. Q: This was reported by the BBC. Did you give this information to the BBC? No, says Rogers. He says he never leaks information. Q: There is a view that you were involved. Rogers says he can categorically deny that. This information was based on something he wrote in a confidential memo to Theresa May on 14 October, before her first EU summit. He is known for writing very long memos, he says. He says he has “no idea” why this came out two months later. Rogers denies leaking information about how getting an UK-EU trade deal could take up to 10 years. Q: How important is confidentiality? Rogers says he thinks quite a lot of the negotiations will take place in public. But that is not always ideal for negotiators, he says. Rogers says it is not fully appreciated how important it will be for the remaining 27 members of the EU to decide what they want themselves before they start negotiations with the UK. Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s former ambassador to the EU, has just started giving evidence to the European scrutiny committee. He says the Brexit negotiations will be “on a humongous scale”. There will only be a deal if both sides want one, he says. You can watch the hearing here. The UK in a Changing Europe, an academic research project, and the Mile End Institute have conducted some research about the attitude MPs have to Brexit. They polled 101 MPs and then weighted them, by party, to make them representative of the Commons. And the conclusions are perhaps not that surprising; that there are significant differences between the views of leave and remain MPs. Here are some extracts from their news release. Of leave MPs, 72% prioritise controlling immigration or not paying into the EU budget over retaining access to the single market. MPs who voted to remain in the EU, however, are more divided, with under half prioritising access to the single market over either immigration control or paying into the EU budget, with the rest taking a variety of different positions ... A minority of MPs believe that the referendum result would not be honoured if Britain remained in the single market (just 26% think this would not honour the result) or continued to pay into the EU budget (35%). The latter contrasts with polling by Lord Ashcroft (in August) which found 81% of the public believed continuing to pay into the EU budget would not be compatible with leaving the EU. MPs see controlling immigration from the EU as key – with 58% viewing it as a condition for respecting the referendum result. However, when it comes to EU nationals already living and working in the UK, MPs say that allowing them to stay is compatible with the referendum result – only 5% say this is incompatible with leaving the EU. Pro-European Tories want more concessions from the government over the Brexit process, but they seem reluctant to commit themselves to voting with Labour when MPs debate detailed amendments to the article 50 bill next week. Here is an extract from a story in the Times today (paywall) about their thinking. Pro-European Tory MPs have warned ministers that they expect to see parliament given a “meaningful vote” on the outcome of Britain’s Brexit negotiations before a deal is ratified in Europe .. The government has said that it will give parliament a vote on the final deal but has made clear it would not represent a chance to veto Brexit or call another referendum. Privately, pro-European MPs do not believe this promise is meaningful but, having won a concession over the publication of a white paper, they do not want to be seen as disloyal by siding with the opposition amendments. However, they have made clear to the whips that they expect further concessions: a proper debate and vote in parliament before any deal is finalised is their key demand. “They have banked the white paper and now is not the time to be seen to be disloyal by siding with Labour,” one source said. “There will be no rebellion but that does not mean that people have changed their views.” The obvious problem with the approach as described here is that, unless they threaten to rebel, the pro-European Tories do not have any leverage they can use to get the government to offer more. The former head of NHS Digital has said he was put under “immense pressure” by the Home Office under Theresa May to release data on immigrants despite his concerns over its legality, the Press Association reports. Kingsley Manning said he was challenged for “daring” to question if there was a legal basis for handing over confidential patient data that would help the Home Office trace suspected illegal immigrants. Last month, the Home Office published an agreement showing the basis by which information can be requested from NHS Digital. But Manning said the NHS body has been forced to hand over data that the Home Office would find useful since “at least” 2005, sometimes to junior officials who would just “ring up” and ask for it. In an interview with the Health Service Journal (HSJ), Manning said: We said to the Home Office: ‘We need to understand what the legal basis of this is.’ The Home Office response was: ‘How dare you even question our right to this information. This is data that belongs to the public. It is paid for by the taxpayer. We should use it for public policy’ ... The Home Office view was that tracing illegal immigrants was a manifesto commitment. If I didn’t agree to co-operate [with the sharing of patient data] they would simply take the issue to Downing Street. Sir Anthony Seldon, who has written the official history of Number 10 as well as books on the last four UK prime ministers, has come up with a list of the 10 most important things for a prime minister to do and the 10 to be most avoided. He offered the advice in a speech to the Institute for Government in Whitehall yesterday, Professor Seldon was careful to avoid saying how Theresa May rated on these 10 yardsticks, but in questions after his lecture he said he was concerned that modern prime ministers travelled too much. Although he himself had favoured remaining in the European Union, the professor said that one advantage of Brexit would be that the prime minister would not have to travel to so many EU summits. He said that no prime minister should normally serve more than seven years and he revealed that David Cameron would have retired from Number 10 in 2018 if he had won the EU referendum last year. Most speculation had previously assumed Cameron would have stayed on until late 2019 before handing over in time for the next general election in 2020. Professor Seldon’s ten top Dos and Don’ts for a successful premiership were: Do “secure the citadel” at Number 10 by forging strong bonds of trust from the start with the cabinet secretary in order to drive priorities Do find your authentic political voice and stick to it. If you don’t, the press will find it for you. Leaders are most persuasive when they speak from the heart not the head. Do focus on the big things. You will only be remembered one or two things, perhaps three at best. So be macro not micro. Do control your time. Be spare about chairing cabinet committees. Carve out time for reflection and rest. Go on, and stay on, holiday Do be totally clear from the outset with the cabinet. Tell them what you want. Sack them quickly if necessary. Find an enforcer in your cabinet to do the machine work. Do set a clear relationship with the media. Either they are the masters or you are. Be aloof. Be regal. Pick a fight with the media early on, and win it. Do behave with dignity and decorum. A prime minister is only one rung down from a head of state. You are a big figure. Display gravitas to gain respect. Never snap back. Do seize the big moments and command them. Set the tone for the key issues, debates and unexpected events. Aim to use a crisis to leave your footprint on history. Do be lean and simple in your leadership. Think longterm. Avoid the impulse to react to everything. Be sparing with reshuffles and relaunches. Do choose a chancellor of the exchequer whom you trust, and with whom you can work well. Don’t choose either a poodle or a tiger. And here are his ten tips on things for a prime minister to avoid: Don’t spend your time fiddling with trivial issues Don’t overwork Don’t have silly fights with colleagues, which diminish a premier’s authority Don’t be angry or bad tempered, as Anthony Eden, Gordon Brown and occasionally David Cameron were Don’t put the micro side of government before the macro Don’t blur or conceal the truth. If there is a bad test launch of a missile, be open. Don’t react. Be active and optimistic Don’t abandon the dignity of the office Don’t lose the backing of your cabinet Don’t drink too much or preferably at all It’s the full Brexit again today. MPs will resume their debate on the second reading of the article 50 bill, or the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill, to give it its full title, and they will vote at 7pm. The bill is certain to be passed, but we will find out this evening how many Labour MPs are willing to defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote against it. Here is our live blog from yesterday covering what happened in the debate until it ended at midnight. But, before that, we’ve got two interesting Brexit-related committees. Sir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s ambassador to the EU last month with a parting email implicitly accusing Number 10 of “muddled thinking” on Brexit, will be speaking in public about this for the first time to the European scrutiny committee. And Liam Fox, the international development secretary, will give evidence to the first time to the committee set up to shadow his department. Oh, and there is PMQs too. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.05am: Sir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s ambassador to the EU earlier than expected last month, gives evidence on EU-UK relations to the Commons European scrutiny committee. 10.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the international trade committee for the first time. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 12.40pm: MPs resume the article 50 bill second reading debate. 7pm: MPs vote on the article 50 bill. They will vote first on an SNP amendment opposing the bill, then on the bill itself, and then on the government’s programme motion. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Israel has warned that it will not countenance an Iranian nuclear weapons programme, and the US has argued that, while it wants to give diplomacy time, all options remain on the table. The rhetoric was ratcheted up again last week with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington DC. But to what extent should we take the sabre-rattling at face value? And what's being said inside Iran? Join Iranian Guardian journalist, Saeed Kamali Dehghan, and security writer Richard Norton-Taylor, from 2-3pm GMT this afternoon when they will be live in the comment thread, answering your questions. Comments will be open from 1.30pm. redredrhine asks: Iran has dozens of nuclear sites, some of which are underground. How can bombing Iran serve to diminish their nuclear ambitions - won't it always just entrench them? Have they any hope of success, whether by Israel alone, or with American assistance? And if they fail, are we not just strengthening the position of radicals in Iran, such as Mahmoud \"I'madinnerjacket\" SaeedKD responds: Well, bombing Iran is illegal under international law in the first place. Little has been said about the legality of the issue, so one might mistake it as to be justified, where as it is not. When we talk about Iran's nuclear ambitions, it should be noted, that it's what the west assume is Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iranian officials have publicly said they have no intention to go onto the path of a weapons programme. Of course, whether that's true or not, is under an international dispute. Despite all concerns about Iran's nuclear programme, we should always remember, there's still no proof of Iran actually making a bomb. If, as Israelis suspect, Iran has plans for military applications of their nuclear programme, then an air strike would only make them determined to pull out of NPT and make it. RichardNortonTaylor responds: Thanks for this. There are many different , possibly deliberately conflicting and confusing, views expressed by Israeli, US, and UK, intelligence agencies about for how long any bombing would delay an Iranian nuclear weapons programme. The consensus is that it might delay but not end, the programme. UNOINO asks: For there to be an honest discussion about the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran about Iran's nuclear program surely mention must be made of Israel's nuclear arsenal, yet to find such mention in any of the mainstream news outlets is near impossible. Could you tell us why this is the case. SaeedKD responds: There has been mention of Israel's nuclear arsenal in the mainstream media, very recently in a Guardian's editorial here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/israel-iran-straining-leash-editorial RichardNortonTaylor responds: A good point - I have always been astonished by the 'omerta' surrounding this - and the lack of any sympathy with the Israel nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu among people I would have thought would be sympathetic to him and appalled by the treatment he received. sjxt asks: 1. Do you really think Obama would use force if and when he came to the conclusion sanctions had \"failed\"? 2. What on earth would he do/hope to achieve if he did - given every military experts from Panetta down seems to be of the clear view that at the very best this would only delay Iran for a year or two? RichardNortonTaylor responds: I really don't think Obama wants to use force against Iran ever. In my view, he must hold his nerve during the final months of the US presidential elections. Attacks would only delay, not end - that seems to be the consensus. SaeedKD responds: I think Obama will only use force if the US believes Iran has passed its \"red lines\". Up to now, Iran hasn't passed the US \"red lines\", which is making the bomb rather than enriching uranium - even on high levels - but yet allowable under NPT. DrRocks asks: Given the geographically limited size of Israel, and the widespread negative effects of a nuclear strike, why would Iran be likely to launch an nuclear attack against Israel when the effects would be near equally felt by it's muslim allies in the region? DavidShariatmadari responds: That's a good question - you've highlighted one of the lesser disincentives to Iran using a nuclear weapon. Others include the catastrophic effect on its economy, the opprobrium of the entire civilised world, the overwhelming likelihood of an immediate and deadly military response, the swift sweeping away of the regime. All of which points to the conclusion that Iran, even if it tested a nuclear weapon, would be exceedingly unlikely to use it in anger. Remember - nuclear weapons, if used correctly, never explode! They're a tool - albeit a very expensive and blunt one - of policy. StephenStewart asks: The Iran crisis is a manufactured affair motivated by a convergence of Israeli and American interests. Both Israel and America, of course, already have nuclear weapons and Israel has never allowed inspectors to examine it's weapons capabilities. On the Israeli side, Bibi Netanyahu's Likud party represents the religious zionists whose vanguard are the kippot srugot zealots, or so-called \"settlers.\" This faction will do anything to avoid implementing a two state solution. Unfortunately, the only hope for peace in the middle east requires Israel and Palestine to mutually acknowledge the other's right to exist. In the absence of a sincere effort to make peace with it's neighbors, Israel recognizes that it's greatest threat comes from Iran. The Americans have been fighting a war in Afghanistan for the past ten years for the right to build a pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan and Pakistan to India. This strategy is being undermined by a proposal to build a pipeline from Iran to Pakistan that will deliver much lower cost fuel. Hence the urgency for a boycott of Iranian oil. Of course, America also has a long term strategic interest in another regime change in Iran which, after all, has the world's third largest oil reserves. The irony is that Israel and America are driving Iran to produce nuclear weapons by their escalating threats of war. Comments? RichardNortonTaylor responds: Thanks for this too. A number of points: Iran has signed the non-proliferation treaty, unlike Israel (or India and Pakistan) - the US has turned a blind eye to this. It is possible that the Iranian government and parliament is divided over whether to develop nuclear weapons. There is a view, which I can well understand, that an attack would unite the country into acquiring a nuclear weapon. Another question: would Iraq or Libya have been attacked if they had had nuclear weapons ? madpoppies asks: I was in Iran a year ago, one thing I noticed was that every single person I spoke to absolutely loathed the current regime &amp; clerics. Do you think an attack on nuclear facilities such as the one near Kashan &amp; Qom would turn many of the Iranian people back towards the regime &amp; clerics, or would they likely remain of the view that it's their own governments fault? SaeedKD responds: It's difficult to say whether international pressure on Iran has backfired, making Iranians to back the regime but I have seen many who are not supporter of the regime but support its nuclear programme which they see as a national cause. Iranians are patriotic and an attack is likely to be seen as a strike against Iran rather than strike against the regime. RolandEBrown asks: A question for all posting comments here: If the current crisis were to evaporate, and Iran was to develop nuclear weapons and test them, how would you react on that day, and why? SaeedKD responds: I think we can still live with a nuclear Iran capable of making nuclear bomb. We are living with Israel, we would be able to live with Iran, too. RichardNortonTaylor responds: It would be easier then, ironically perhaps, to get Iran to the negotiating table. civical asks: Seems to me that the media and political fixation on enrichment of uranium is a slight red herring as I doubt Iran intends to build a Uranium bomb. However when you put together enrichment to 20% with the building of a 40MWatt Heavy Water 'Research' reactor at Arak one could think that a) 40MWatt a bit big for a research reactor, b)Heavy Water reactor = Tool of choice for making Plutonium, c) 20% Uranium + Natural Uranium in a Heavy Water reactor output = Plutonium you can understand why there is some nervousness about their intentions. So either Iran is trying to make a bomb or is playing a very dangerous game of winding Israel and the West up by putting in place all the tools for doing so and making taunting pronouncements of their successes, what do you think? SaeedKD responds: Well, regardless of either of these intentions, Iranians are allowed to do what they do in Arak under NPT, as long as its under IAEA surveillance. AdamLevick asks: Remarkably missing from the debate about Iran on these pages (with a couple exceptions) is the fact that an Iranian leader dripping with hatred for Jews states repeatedly that he wants to wipe Israel off the map in explicit terms and denies (or at least casts doubt) that the original Holocaust actually happened. Further, his nation's spiritual leader has called Israel a cancerous tumor, and issued a religious justification for the murder of millions of Jews. And, finally,Iran arms and funds Islamic Jihad, Hamas and Hezbollah - and has stood behind their ally, Syria, no how matter how much brutality Assad commits against the citizens of his country. I honestly don't understand how a discussion about the Iranian nuclear issue can avoid such morally reprehensible Iranian behavior. SaeedKD responds: Iranian leaders have been crazy with their words, but I think they've done less in their actions to merit the status they are in because of their words. We can't measure which one is more dangerous to the world, Israel or Iran, can we? Leaders in both countries have said crazy things, have discriminated against others. JA12345 asks: Given that the United States Department of Defence recently wrote an internal document stating that Iran's military is geared towards holding off an attack long enough to begin diplomatic discussions, and that the same would be true were they to have a nuclear weapon, why is there such an obsession about a blatantly false threat? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rutrNbkrhIA Given that if Iran were ever to attack or even signal they were about to attack anyone Israel (an immensely stronger military power with numerous nuclear weapons) and the US (the world's greatest ever superpower) would utterly obliterate them as they want to do regardless of Iran not attacking or showing any intent (something their internal documents reveal), then how can we put up with this absurd propaganda about the 'evil threat'? We need a new villain, that's all, to play out in our theatre of politics, and Iran are serving well. RichardNortonTaylor responds: The Iran government may be bad, but it is not mad. That is one view. Others say an Iran with nuclear weapons would make other countries vulnerable to 'nuclear blackmail'. Jiri asks: Do countries who are not members of the NNPT have the right to develop nuclear power? SaeedKD responds: If you are not a signatory to NNPT, you can do whatever you want, as do Israel, Pakistan, India. Iran, however, has voluntarily signed NNPT, promising not to make nuclear bombs and give the IAEA access to its nuclear sites. Iranians always accuse the west of double standards, making allegations against Iran which is a member of the NNPT while turning a blind eye on Israel, which does not allow any IAEA inspector to see its nuclear sites. Kerfuffling asks: Rather than create a hostile situation with military action high on the rhetoric agenda, would it not be better to engage an economic policy of trade with Iran. Eventually leading to such an intertwinned web that it restricts such playground bullying threats from either side. Especially as Iran has agreements for mineral exchanges for food commodities that are attempts at circumventing financial markets and related commodity indexes. RichardNortonTaylor responds: Engage with Iran , kill by kindness kind of thing. That's what the late Robin Cook always used to say , and Shirley Williams - and other senior concerned British politicians - say now. Iran wants to be recognised as a major player. It wants Status. There are other ways of getting it than possessing nuclear weapons. 0fabulas1 asks: To what extent is the nuclear issue a diversionary tactic to try and unify the Iranian people against an external threat, thereby distracting them from internal issues? If so, why is the West playing the game? SaeedKD responds: Many believe it is a tactic, not only for Iran, but also for Israel and the US.All the three are benefiting from creating an outside enemy for national causes. RememberGiap asks: Apart from the obvious political reasons can you advise me why IAEA inspectors are never allowed near Israel's nuclear weapon establishments and why their existence is rarely mentioned in relation to the Iran/Israel nuclear debate? SaeedKD responds: You are right. The west has been hypocritical about Israel's nuclear arsenal v Iran allegations. mysterywhiteboy asks: With the US and Israel heading for an armed conflict with Iran, do you see the UK as likely to join in this one? RichardNortonTaylor responds: Many in the government, and defence chiefs especially, are worried that David Cameron will not be able to say No, if Obama asks the UK to join an attack. Specifically, the US has already indicated that it will need its base on Britain's Indian Ocean Territory, Diego Garcia. (Officials always asked me after the invasion of Iraq : 'Can you imagine a British prime minister saying No to a request from Washington?' Harold Wilson said No over Vietnam...). alexandersearch asks: If Iran is in breach of its NPT obligations what does this mean for the NPT? and why are people so uninterested in this aspect of the problem? SaeedKD responds: Iran is in breach of security council resolutions but not in breach of NPT: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace Icaruss asks: Has Ahmednijad any control over direction of Iran's nuclear programme? Who has the final say on this issue? RichardNortonTaylor responds: The Ayatollah (Khamenei) and his revolutionary Guards. SaeedKD responds: As a lame-duck president, he's not even in control of his own government now. The nuclear policy comes from top, the supreme leaders and his revolutionary guards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/29/planners-approve-nuclear-power-station-preparatory-work","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-29T09:47:44Z","webTitle":"Hinkley C nuclear power station gets green light for preparatory work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/29/planners-approve-nuclear-power-station-preparatory-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/29/planners-approve-nuclear-power-station-preparatory-work","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley C nuclear power station gets green light for preparatory work","bodyText":"Work is to begin on the site of the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for 20 years, despite fierce opposition from campaigners who say it will wreck the Somerset coastline. Officials have approved plans for preparatory work on Hinkley C to begin and the site's developers, EDF Energy, say the power station will help secure Britain's power supply and boost the local economy. Anti-nuclear campaigners believe West Somerset district council has been pressured by the government to approve the site, and villagers whose lives will be affected say the project would change the area forever. Crispin Aubrey, of the Stop Hinkley campaign, argued that the work would leave a \"devastated wasteland\" and said it was \"inaccurate\" to describe the work EDF has been given permission for as \"preparatory\". \"The extent of the activity, the clearance of most vegetation, hedges and trees, the excavation of more than two million cubic metres of soil and rocks, the re-routing of underground streams, the creation of roads and roundabouts, major changes to the landscape ... mean it is effectively the beginning of construction of the proposed Hinkley C nuclear power station,\" he said. He claimed the \"overriding\" pressure to proceed had come from the government and asked councillors at a meeting of west Somerset district council's planning committee: \"Are you prepared to override local concerns because the government is leaning on you? \"The real purpose of this application is not to significantly advance the timing of the new plant, it is to destroy all that is precious about the site so that when the main application for the power station is made to the infrastructure planning commission [IPC] it will meet with less opposition. \"If the site is covered in concrete, then it will be so much easier for the decision to be made in its favour.\" Nikki Clark, also of the Stop Hinkley campaign, claimed not enough work had been done to assess the risk of Hinkley C being damaged because of rising sea levels. \"Ongoing events at Fukushima are a timely reminder of the consequences of flooding at coastal nuclear sites,\" she added. A third group member, Helen Grant, told the meeting: \"Nuclear was flavour of the month before Fukishima. Now governments around the world are wobbling on nuclear.\" Opponents of the scheme have pointed out that if the government went cold on nuclear energy, or EDF decided to pull out of the project, the area would be left with the \"biggest hole in Europe\". However, not all local residents are opposed to the scheme, and many feel it will bring jobs to an area in which they are much needed and which has lived with nuclear power stations for more than 50 years. David Rosser, the south-west and Wales regional director of the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"We believe it critical that we are able to guarantee a secure and low carbon energy mix for the UK in the decades to come.\" Rupert Cox, the chief executive of Somerset Chamber of Commerce, said: \"It's an opportunity to kickstart the local economy – thousands of jobs during construction, hundreds for the many years of operation and millions of pounds for the local economy and the skills and training provision in Somerset.\" EDF will immediately submit applications for various permits required to build, commission, operate and decommission the Hinkley C nuclear power station. It will submit its development consent order – full planning permission – to the infrastructure planning commission later this year. The company has promised to restore the site if the build does not go ahead. It says 500 jobs will be created during the preparatory stage, and it is ploughing £25m into minimising the impact of the work on the local environment and communities. It says the power station will be safe and will help secure Britain's energy supply. The EDF chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, thanked the councillors for giving permission for work to go ahead. \"They have taken a major decision enabling a project which is vital to the country,\" he said. \"We are committed to listen to the community and to deliver this investment in partnership with the people of Somerset.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/mar/03/eu-referendum-french-calais-warning-dismissed-as-propaganda-by-brexit-campaign-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-03T17:23:41Z","webTitle":"EU referendum: Hollande says Brexit would have 'consequences' which could affect Calais border deal - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/03/eu-referendum-french-calais-warning-dismissed-as-propaganda-by-brexit-campaign-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/03/eu-referendum-french-calais-warning-dismissed-as-propaganda-by-brexit-campaign-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"EU referendum: Hollande says Brexit would have 'consequences' which could affect Calais border deal - Politics live","bodyText":"François Hollande, the French president, has warned that Britain will face “consequences” if it votes to leave the EU, suggesting this could lead to France scrapping the border deal that contributes to migrants heading for the UK being held back at Calais. He made the comment at a joint press conference with David Cameron. See 3.49pm for a full summary. Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, has joined other Brexit campaigners in dismissing claims that the French might tear up the Calais border deal in the event of Britain voting to leave the EU. During a visit in south London he said: I would say ‘Donnez-moi un break’. There’s absolutely no reason why that treaty should be changed. It was an inter-governmental treaty, it was the Le Touquet treaty. It was signed between the British government and the French government. It’s not in the French interests to want to do that and it’s just the usual flapping and scaremongering. Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, has said that Britain leaving the EU would damage the continent’s stability. Speaking at the BCC conference in London, he said Brexit would make Europe “less stable and more volatile”. Asked how Germany would feel if the UK voted to leave on June 23, he joked: “We would cry.” Jo Johnson, the science minister (and Boris Johnson’s brother), has said that science and technology firms could suffer in a “decade of uncertainty” if Britain left the EU. In a speech in Cambridge, which he described as “the most successful innovation cluster in Europe”, he said: In this referendum campaign, it is vital that we have an evidence-based debate and properly informed choice. The facts matter. And few value evidence more than scientists. That’s why we should take seriously the surveys showing nine out of 10 agree EU membership benefits UK science and engineering. That’s why we should take seriously the fact that none of the 132 vice chancellors represented by Universities UK is advocating leaving. My clear view is that a vote to leave would be a leap in the dark, and one that would put the Cambridge phenomenon and our status as a science superpower at risk. While many factors explain Cambridge’s success, it’s clear that our close ties with the European Union are a crucial part of this great national success story. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of the Vote Leave group, has pre-empted a formal part of the referendum process by describing his group as the official leave campaign. Toyota, one of the biggest manufacturers in Britain, has warned it will be forced to make significant cutbacks if the country votes to leave the EU. The head of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, has accused a Labour MP of pursuing a “sinister agenda” and making a “disgraceful” allegation of bullying against one of his union members. As Rajeev Syal reports, the general secretary of Britain’s biggest trade union made his claims in a letter sent directly to former shadow minister Stephen Doughty. Doughty had compared the alleged behaviour of the union member to alleged bullying by Tory activists that led to the death of Elliott Johnson. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, was on Sky New a few minutes ago responding to what President Hollande said about Calais. (See 3.49pm.) He accused the French of giving “mixed messages” on this topic and said that Hollande was part of a “Euro establishment” trying to influence the British referendum. I think the comments we’ve heard today from France are all part of the noises coming from the Euro establishment trying to keep us in the European Union by sowing seeds of doubts in the minds of our people about what might happen. Now the truth is very different. It is only two weeks since we had the French interior minister, who is after all responsible for the border in Calais, saying that there is no way that the European Union, or indeed France, would want to back away from those arrangements. And it is important to say that it is a treaty between Britain and France. It is not a treaty with the European Union. It is clearly not in the interests of France to have chaos at Calais. And if they suddenly turned around and said the border is not there anymore, we are not going to suddenly let very large number of migrants come through the Channel Tunnel into Britain. But what it will do is attract large numbers more migrants to Calais, which is not what they want. So we’re getting mixed message from French ministers. And it’s all because there’s a drive by the French government and other governments to try and influence over voters into staying in Europe. Grayling was referring to Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister. Cazeneuve actually made his comments about Calais in October last year, but French government sources said last month that they still applied. On the subject of unaccompanied child migrants at Calais, David Cameron said that if they had direct family in Britain and if they applied for asylum in France, under the Dublin Convention they could join their family in Britain. Those were the current arrangements, he said. But “we’ve talked today about how we can make sure they work better and more speedily”, he said. Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, said the British and French governments both needed to get their act together on this issue. Right now many lone child refugees aren’t being identified or protected by the French authorities, and Britain is dragging its feet rather than help those who have family here desperate to care for them. It is shameful that both governments are failing vulnerable children who are at terrible risk of exploitation and abuse. All of us would be traumatised if our own children were living in these conditions - we have a moral duty not to turn our backs on them now, especially when they have relatives ready to keep them safe. It currently takes 9 months before France issues a ‘take charge’ request to the British Government for unaccompanied children, and the UK has rejected 2 of those applications in the last few weeks alone. Charities estimate there are up to 150 children in Calais who have family here in the UK who could look after them while their asylum claim is processed. The British and French Governments should tell us how many child refugees they believe there are in Calais, how many have applied for asylum, how many have applied to be transferred to Britain to be with family and why the British Government has failed to decide their cases. If we are to prevent those children disappearing into the hands of people traffickers the French must put in place child protection measures immediately for all the unaccompanied children there and the UK and French must work together now to reunite them with family as soon as possible. This is from James McGrory, head of communications for Britain Stronger in Europe. Here are the main points from the press conference with David Cameron and Francois Hollande, the French president. Hollande hinted that France could suspend the agreement that allows British border police to operate in Calais if the UK leaves the EU. Emmanuel Macron, the French finance minister, raised this prospect in an interview with the Financial Times this morning. Asked if Macron was right, Hollande said that there would be “consequences” if Britain left the EU. He did not explicitly confirm that France would tear up the 2003 Le Touquet agreement (which allows the British to carry out their border checks at Calais), but he said there would be “consequences” in many areas, including “in the way we handle [immigration]”. He said: I don’t want to scare you. I just want to say the truth. There will be consequences if the United Kingdom is to leave the EU. There will be consequences in many areas, on the single market, on financial trade, on economic development ... I don’t want to give you a catastrophic scenario but there will be consequences, especially in terms of people as well. Robert Harris, the author and former political journalist, says this is a gift to the Out campaign. Cameron said the Brexit camaigners who have accused him of being engaged in a conspiracy to get the French, and others, to talk up the dangers of leaving the EU were falling for a “David Icke-style” conspiracy. The issue arose because some Eurosceptics have claimed Number 10 was involved in getting Macron to speak out to the FT. Asked about this, Cameron replied: Of course you can say this is all some giant conspiracy, some sort of David Icke-style ... It’s just nonsense. The best thing to do is to listen to the arguments, to listen to what people are saying, and to understand some of the risks and some of the uncertainties about leaving the European Union ... When lots of friends of the United Kingdom, lots of organisations involved in industry and business and commerce and farming, are giving these warnings and drawing attention to these uncertainties, I would say it’s worth listening to those, rather than trying to pretend it is part of some giant conspiracy, which I think is complete nonsense. Cameron’s comment may have been aimed at David Davis, the Conservative MP who issued a statement earlier saying: “I am afraid that this looks like a stitch up between the British prime minister and the French president.” Or it could be aimed at the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin who, commenting on the Macron interview, told the Today programme: “What we are having now is propaganda being produced by other European governments at the request of the prime minister to try to scare people (out of) voting Leave.” Cameron criticised those who want to leave the EU for not being able to answer questions about what the alternative to EU membership would look like. He said: The people who could try and allay some of those risks are the people advising us to leave the EU. But they have not. They have disagreed about whether they want one referendum or two. They have disagreed about what sort of exit they would like to have. They can’t tell us whether we should be part of the single market or have trading deal. So I think there is in this debate a very big contrast coming out, from the certainty and clarity of staying in a reformed European Union, where we know what the arrangements are, we know our businesses can access that market, we know how our borders work, we know all the arrangements in place. There is that certainty set against the huge risk and uncertainty of the alternatives, made even more risky in my view by the fact that the people who are proposing them don’t seem to want to answer any questions about how those proposals would work. Cameron said that he and Hollande had agreed that unaccompanied child migrants at Calais with direct family in the UK could come to the UK. This was already allowed under the Dublin convention, he said. But he said the British and French would try to ensure this happened more quickly. He said Britain was giving £17m to help the French address the migrant problem at Calais. He said Britain and France were going to spend £1.5bn developing a new generation of drones. He described them as unmanned combat air systems and said they would be “the most advanced of its kind in Europe, securing high-end engineering jobs and expertise in both the UK and France”. And that’s it. The press conference is over. I’ll post a summary shortly. Cameron says Britain does not want to wait before talking to the government in Libya. It wants to avoid a further route opening up for migrants to come to Europe, he says. He says Britain and France and working closely on this. Q: What will happen to the Calais camp if Britain votes to leave the EU? Hollande says if Britain votes to leave the EU “there will be consequences”, including relating to the Calais situation. But he does not specify what those consequences would be. Hollande hinted that Britain leaving the EU could lead to the withdrawal of French/British border cooperation at Calais, saying “there will be consequences if the United Kingdom is to leave the EU”. Q: All these interventions seem convenient. Are they a stitch-up? Cameron says lots of people around the world are making their views known. But when you have messages from countries like America and France, those are worth listening to. And when businesses express views, those are worth listening to. You can say it’s some David Icke-style giant conspiracy. But that’s nonsense, he says. He says the Out camp disagree on whether there should be one referendum or two. And they cannot say what would happen if the UK left. The alternatives are risky. And those risks are made even greater by the refusal of the Out camp to say what they want. The idea of a conspiracy is complete nonsense, he says. Cameron dismissed idea that he is colluding with France to warn about dangers of Brexit as “nonsense”. Q: What are you going to do about unaccompanied child migrants at Calais? Cameron says the £17m he is announcing today is on top of money already pledged to help the French at Calais. He says he applauds what the French are doing at Calais, and the action they have taken with the camps. He says Hollande has his 100% backing over this. As for unaccompanied children, he says it has always been the case that someone with direct family in Britain can apply for asylum in France and come to Britain. That is the rule under the Dublin convention. But he says this will be clarified. Hollande says France has done its utmost to receive those who have the right to asylum. There are some people who don’t want to stay in France, and others not allowed to stay in France. Hollande says, with regard to the people who want to go to the UK, if the UK decides not to take them, access will be closed. That is the message he is trying to get across, he says. Hollande says France follows up unaccompanied children. If they have a family link to the UK, then they must go there, and they must go quickly and in an efficient fashion. The two leaders are now taking questions. Q: Brexit campaigners say you are scaremongering? And it’s hardly surprising that France is backing Britain over Calais. They want the UK to stay in the EU. Cameron says, drawing on his experience as prime minister, he can see that Britain benefits from its membership of the EU. When Britain wants to act to keep people safe, it gains from being able to act with other countries. He quotes from today’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders survey, arguing that this shows why Britain is better off in the EU. He is not making hyperbolic claims. He is talking about the reality that exists now. It is not good enough for the Brexit campaigners to avoid the questions about what Britain would be like outside the EU. Cameron criticises Brexit campaigners for not answering questions about what Britain would be like outside the EU. David Cameron is speaking now. He says the summit was about how Britain and France stand together to keep their people safe. He says the two countries have stood shoulder to shoulder and do so again today. That is particularly important after the Paris terror attacks, he says. He says Britain and France have been attacking Daesh in Syria and Iraq. They are degrading its capabilities. But there is a need for peace, he says. He says he, Hollande and Chancellor Merkel will speak to Putin, he says. He says Russia needs to stop its attacks on the Syrian opposition. He says France and Britain have agreed to extend their counter-terrorism cooperation. On defence collaboration, Britain and France have agreed to invest £1.5bn in drone technology. He says Britain will contribute £17m to help the French deal with migrant problems at Calais. Britain to contribute £17m to help the French deal with migrant problems at Calais. He thanks Cameron for his contribution to the climate change conference in Paris. The UK was more than an ally, he says. It was a true partner. He mentions the Hinckley Point nuclear power station project (an Anglo-French collaboration). We are neighbouring countries and friends, he says. The entente is still cordiale. Hollande says unaccompanied child refugees in Calais should be able to join relatives in the UK. He says Calais and the surrounding areas, including Dunkirk, are suffering because of the refugee crisis. The UK is not a member of Schengen. So France tells refugees they can have their rights recognised in France. There are fewer migrants and refugees in Calais than there were a few weeks ago, he says. Those who remain should be treated with dignity, he says. Hollande says Cameron and he discussed the EU referendum. Hollande and other EU leaders spent a long time negotiating a package for the UK. He says he hopes the UK stays in Europe. That is in the interests of the UK, and of the EU. But the people are sovereign. Hollande says there will be a discussion at the European Council on Monday on refugees. Greece must be supported, he says. When resettlement is allowed, “we should play our part”, he says. This will be discussed on Monday. Europe should show solidarity. Hollande says Britain and France are both pushing for peace in Syria. We need Russia’s participation, he says. But it needs to understand that there is an opposition in Syria that is not Daesh (Islamic State). He says he and Cameron discussed Libya. This is another place where Britain and France are working together. They want a government to be installed. The press conference is starting. Francois Hollande goes first. He speaks about his visit with David Cameron to the First World War cemetery earlier. (See 11.33am.) We’re still waiting for the Cameron/Hollande press conference to start. In the meantime, George Osborne, the chancellor, has been speaking at the BCC conference. Here are pictures from the UK/France summit. David Cameron and Francois Hollande, the French president, are about to hold a press conference at the UK/France summit in Amiens. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has claimed that Labour and business are “natural allies” in a wide-ranging speech to the British Chambers of Commerce conference. It was his first major speech to a business audience. (See 12.32pm.) France has been accused of “blackmail” after a senior French government minister has said his country could tear up an agreement allowing British border police to operate in Calais if the UK leaves the EU. David Davis, the Conservative MP and a spokemsan for Grassroots Out (GO), suggested that Downing Street was involved in getting Emmanuel Macron to speak out to the Financial Times. He also said that, if France allowed migrants to come to the UK illegally, Britain could just send them back. He said: This is more like bluster than a real threat. The simple point is that if we leave the EU, we regain control of our borders and we decide who comes in and who doesn’t. If the French start putting illegal immigrants on a train or ferry and send them to Britain, we will send them straight back to France. I am afraid that this looks like a stitch up between the British prime minister and the French president. Mr Cameron has already sought to alarm the country by saying the Calais migrant camp could move to Kent if we quit the EU. Now the French finance minister Emmanuel Macron looks like he is playing the same game. Project Fear has a new recruit. The British people are unlikely to be impressed with this latest round of blackmail threats and even less impressed by the British government’s collusion. Downing Street says it did not know about Macron’s interview with the FT in advance. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said that he remains a “Brussels basher” despite deciding to support remaining in the EU. Speaking at the BCC conference he said: I have no time for closer political union and in many ways I am a Eurosceptic. I am still a Brussels basher and will remain so. He also appeared to criticise Cameron’s EU renegotation deal, saying: “I wish there was more in the deal.” John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has indicated that he is personally opposed to Britain remaining in the EU. Speaking to the BCC conference, he said the BCC would not campaign in the referendum “not least because the business community in the UK is divided on the issue of Europe”. He said it was “still possible that the prime minister may pull further rabbits from the hat” but that the choice in the referendum was between “staying in what is essentially an unreformed EU with the eurozone moving off in another direction and Britain sitting on the margins”, or leaving and facing “near-term uncertainty and disruption”. It was a “tough choice”, he said. Setting out his personal view, he said: The very best place for the UK to be is in a reformed EU ... [but] I have come to the conclusion that the EU is incapable of meaningful reform, at least in the foreseeable future. It certainly does not appear capable of the sort of reform necessary to give the UK breathing space to fulfil its true potential. Cameron is to join fellow European leaders Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel in a conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a bid to shore up the fragile Syrian ceasefire. As the Press Association reports, Downing Street said Friday’s call will offer an opportunity for the prime minister, the French president and the German chancellor to press home to Mr Putin the importance of maintaining the truce, so that peace talks can go ahead “properly” in Geneva next week. A former deputy leader of the Scottish National party has warned supporters of Scottish independence that a vote for Britain to remain in the EU would seriously damage their cause. As Severin Carrell reports, Jim Sillars, who has served as MP for both Labour and the SNP, urged pro-independence voters to ignore Nicola Sturgeon’s calls to support EU membership in June’s referendum, as he launched a campaign aimed at Eurosceptic SNP voters.In a pamphlet published on Thursday for the scotleave.eu campaign, he asserts that the only way to secure Scottish sovereignty is to vote against continued EU membership, since Brussels will otherwise remain an obstacle to independence. David Lidington, the Europe minister, has signed into law the secondary legislation fixing June 23 as the referendum date, after it passed through the House of Lords on Wednesday evening, the Press Association reports. My colleague Anushka Asthana says Number 10 did not know in advance about the Emmanuel Macron interview in the Financial Times. (See 9.11am.) In a good blog for the Staggers, Stephen Bush says Jeremy Corbyn’s speech is the one that Ed Miliband always wanted to give. Here’s an extract. Team Corbyn is still lacking a first-class speechwriter, but buried in the text was an address that Ed Miliband always wanted to give. It ran like this: the problem with the economy under New Labour was an underregulated financial services sector, which left Britain badly exposed during the financial crash. New Labour struck a Faustian pact with the City of London - low taxes and low oversight in exchange for booming revenues to build social democracy at home. What’s instead needed is a complete rebalancing of the economy - using state intervention and innovation to secure sustainable growth. Bush also says Corbyn’s argument was very similar to the one Stewart Wood, Miliband’s key policy adviser, made in this article for Prospect just before the election. This was Jeremy Corbyn’s first proper speech as Labour leader to a business audience (he declined an invitation to address the CBI last year) and doubtless much thought went into preparing for it in his office. As the Times columnist and arch-Blairite Philip Collins points out, a British Chambers of Commerce conference is not exactly Corbyn’s natural habitat. And yet he delivered a speech that ended with a line about Labour and business being “natural allies”. What was it like, and was it ultimately convincing? Overall, it was pretty solid. It wasn’t an exciting or a flashy speech, and it not have anything new to say on policy, but it was coherent, serious and wide-ranging. Corbyn seems to have no affinity at all for big business, but his admiration for small business and start-ups seems genuine. (Interestingly, he finds it easier to get enthusiastic about business when discussing it through the prism of multiculturalism. There was a line in the speech, which wasn’t in the text made public, where he urged the audience to reflect “on the huge opportunities that many BME communities, black and minority ethnic communities, have only had because they were able to open a small business, innovate and develop”. The Labour MP Simon Danczuk noticed a similar trait when he had a private meeting with Corbyn last year, which he subsequently wrote up for the Mail on Sunday.) There was also a political vision within the speech. Corbyn argued that the economic orthodoxy of the past had failed, and he made the case for a “strategic state”, with government intervention and investment being deployed to boost growth. In many respects this is similar to what Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are calling for in the last parliament, although Corbyn went further on the banks (Balls would never describe them as “an extractive industry”) and he also spoke up for collective bargaining, a cause that Miliband and Balls were more cautious about championing. The extracts from the speech released overnight included specific criticism of “New Labour”. Surprisingly, Corbyn chose to tone this passage down a bit. The other important thing to note is how little he had to say about Europe. The reference to supporting the case for Britain staying in the EU was so brief that one colleague in the audience actually missed it. This will reinforce suspicions that Corbyn personally has little enthusiasm for campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, which is something that should worry David Cameron, given the fact that he needs Labour supporters to vote for In. I posted a summary earlier with some key points. (See 10.22am.) Here are some to add. Corbyn said that Labour and business were “natural allies”. All these economic problems are connected. Lack of access to finance constrains export growth. A failure to invest in our digital economy stifles productivity growth. A dearth of skills holds back innovation. In the twenty-first century the role of government is to understand these connections and make policy to fit. You may not like everything we say or do. But when it comes to the big decisions on the economy, infrastructure, skills and investment, we are natural allies. Labour is committed to what is needed for business to expand and succeed. He toned down criticism of New Labour for contributing to the financial crash by not regulating the banks firmly enough. In extracts from the speech released overnight he said: It wasn’t government that was the problem in 2007 and 2008, when the banking sector nearly drove the entire economy to the point of collapse. The New Labour approach was to opt for ‘light touch regulation’ of finance - and then sit back and collect the tax revenues. But you cannot base a decent social policy on an unsustainable economic policy. And we cannot outsource economic policy to the City of London. That has not served our economy well, and it has not served business well. But when he delivered the speech he said: But it wasn’t government that was the problem in 2008, when the banking sector drove the economy to the point of collapse. The political consensus at that time was to opt for ‘light touch regulation’ of finance – and sit back and collect the tax revenues. But you cannot base a decent social policy on an unsustainable economic policy. And we cannot outsource economic policy to the City of London. That has not served our economy well, and it has not served business well. He offered only lukewarm support for Britain remaining in the EU. There was only a cursory reference to Labour’s support for Britain’s membership of the EU in the speech, which was surprising because the EU referendum has been the dominant issue in British politics for the last fortnight, and it is one of particular interest to a business audience. Corbyn said: We should be laying the foundations for a modern economy now. That applies not only within states but between states too; climate change, the refugee crisis, raising standards for workers and consumers and dealing with the minority of companies that seek to avoid their taxes These are all issues that can only be resolved by working with our partners in Europe, not ditching them. This is why we are campaigning to remain in the EU because we believe, like 60 per cent of businesses the BCC surveyed, that the EU is the best framework for trade and cooperation in the 21st century. David Cameron and Francois Hollande, the French president, have paid tribute to those killed in the battle of the Somme at the start of today’s summit in France. This is from the Press Association. David Cameron and French president Francois Hollande have paid tribute to the dead of the Somme 100 years after the battle in which more than 100,000 British servicemen lost their lives. The two leaders laid a wreath at the Pozieres Cemetery near the town of Amiens where almost 3,000 Commonwealth personnel are buried. The ceremony marked the start of a one-day UK-France summit focused on the security and international issues including the migration crisis and the conflicts in Syria and Libya. Amiens and the Somme region were deliberately chosen to host the talks to commemorate the centenary of the First World War battle and the enduring relationship between Britain and France. Altogether some 400,000 British and 200,000 French soldiers were killed or injured at the Somme. Here is some Twitter reaction to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech. (Luckily for Corbyn, David Cameron’s mother isn’t on Twitter. She would have had a problem with that tie.) From Sky News’s Faisal Islam Islam is referring to Mariana Mazzucato, the economist and author of The Entrepreneurial State and a member of Labour’s economic advisory committee. From Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner who spoke at Corbyn rallies during the Labour leadership campaign From Channel 4 News’s Michael Crick From Jolyon Maugham, the Labour-supporting tax barrister and blogger Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech. According to PoliticsHome’s John Ashmore, Channel 4 News’s Michael Crick has been trying to get Jeremy Corbyn to answer a question. Q: Is there room for big corporations in your vision for the future? Yes, there has to be, says Corbyn. He says he is clear about the role of government. He would seek to have a day-to-day working relationship with all sectors of the economy. If you don’t work together, we all lose out, he says. And that’s it. Both questions were the BCC figure chairing the session. There was no time for more, and so Corbyn did not take questions from the audience or from journalists. I’ll post a summary soon. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: What would your “elevator pitch” be to business people today? Corbyn says you need to have a government serious about investment in skills and investment in infrastruture. Colin Chapman founded Lotus Cars in a lock-up garage in Hornsey. He turned out to be a brilliant designer. If he were trying to find a lock-up garage to do that now, would anyone lend him the money. Corbyn is winding up now. All these economic problems are connected. Lack of access to finance constrains export growth. A failure to invest in our digital economy stifles productivity growth. A dearth of skills holds back innovation. In the twenty-first century the role of Government is to understand these connections and make policy to fit. You may not like everything we say or do. But when it comes to the big decisions on the economy, infrastructure, skills and investment, we are natural allies. Labour is committed to what is needed for business to expand and succeed. He says many companies start small. To thrive, they need support. Government should be there to help them succeed, he says. Corbyn says Labour is campaign for Britain to stay in the EU because “we believe, like 60 per cent of businesses the BCC surveyed, that the EU is the best framework for trade and cooperation in the 21st century”. And he says the government should be doing more to promote renewable energy. The transition to a carbon-free economy is essential because of the climate crisis … but it’s also a massive opportunity for investment and growth … Yet Britain sits on the sidelines … with some of the lowest production and use of renewables in the G7. Corbyn calls for more investment in broadband. The evidence is clear that only the public sector and public investment… can guarantee the super-fast broadband network in every part of Britain…. the essential low-cost connections people and businesses need in a 21st century economy. As it is, government foot-dragging and ideological dithering is holding digital Britain back. And he criticises the government’s record on infrastructure too. Then there is the problem of infrastructure. Think about the creaking, underfunded infrastructure our country relies on. In a recent survey the CBI found that two-thirds of businesses are concerned about the slow pace of infrastructure delivery. The Centre for Economics and Business ranks the UK thirteenth on the value of its infrastructure, behind every other G7 country bar Canada. Corbyn criticises the government’s record on apprenticeships. Apprenticeships have a crucial role to play and we must do more invest in vocational education and training. But some apprenticeships are clearly too low quality and look rather more like attempts to avoid paying the minimum wage; Secondly, the Government’s apprenticeship levy, hasn’t been properly thought through. The policy risks being simply, an additional tax on businesses, so that the Government can meet its arbitrary target. Corbyn criticises the government for cutting the adult education budget. The education and skills training gap goes far wider. Across the country, this is the one issue local business people most often raise with me. Yet this government has cut college funding and slashed the adult education budget. On the one hand; there are university graduates unable to find a graduate-level job. While large numbers of unemployed workers are unable to acquire the skills they need to work. Corbyn turns to the NHS. The NHS is in crisis - there are record deficits in NHS trusts, and they come from two key mistakes by government. First, there is the legacy of PFI debt - an inefficient way of delivering necessary investment. The last Labour government lacked the confidence to make the argument to borrow to invest, and so it did what banks thought they could get away with before the crash, an off-the-books accountancy wheeze. In both cases, putting debt off the books did not work it came right back onto the books and helped trigger crisis. Secondly, we have not trained enough nurses and doctors - and the problem is becoming more acute. It means the NHS is spending £4 billion on agency staff to fill gaps. It also means we are reliant on importing nurses and doctors from abroad. And he criticises the banks for acting like an “extractive industry”. Corbyn uses the line, briefed in advance, about how New Labour’s “light touch” banking regulation contributed to the crash. (See 10.22am.) Corbyn says wealth creation is a collective process. Wealth creation is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and creative individuals and businesses. It cannot be based on a race to the bottom in pay and job insecurity, or the subsidy of low wages with in-work benefits. That’s why we’re in favour of a real living wage and stronger trade unions. Corbyn says he wants to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly. We want to see a genuinely mixed economy of public and social enterprise along with long-term private business commitment that will provide the decent pay, jobs, housing, schools, health and social care of the future. An economy based on a new settlement with the corporate sector that, yes, involves both rights and responsibilities. Labour will always seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly. But, to deliver that growth demands real change in the way the economy is run. Corbyn says he wants to consult much more widely when making policy, in particular by listening to “the growing army of the self-employed, often struggling to make ends meet, and falling through the cracks in our social security system”. He urges BCC members to come along to the policy events taking place around the country that John McDonnell is organising. Corbyn says Labour will put investment first. Labour’s alternative will put investment first. We will only borrow to invest over the business cycle. We will put public investment in science, technology and the green industries of the future front and center stage. Only by driving up investment will we achieve the higher productivity we need to guarantee rising living standards for all. We want to see the reindustrialization of Britain for the digital age driven by a national investment bank as a motor of economic modernization based on investment in infrastructure, transport, housing and technology. That provides a solid return. Corbyn say the recovery is “built on sand”. Osborne’s recovery is a house built on sand. But what Labour now stands for is far more than stopping the damage being done by this government. We want to see a break with the failed economic orthodoxy that has gripped policy makers for a generation. The idea that speculative finance would deliver for all that manufacturing could be run down and our strategic assets sold off that the 1980s catechism of deregulation, privatisation and low taxes on the well-off would produce balanced, high investment and productivity growth has been shown to be for the birds. That model of how to run an economy is broken crashed and burned in 2008 and not just in Britain. Corbyn says John McDonnell has laid out the framework for this. As John has said many times, an economy that allows people to flourish and prosper in the 21stcentury will be a very different kind of economy from that of the 1990s, let alone the economy of the 1940s or 1960s. What’s clear is that this government is not creating the economy of the future we need. Six years ago George Osborne said austerity would wipe out the deficit and cut the debt. That didn’t happen. Instead, recovery only got going once the chancellor took the brakes off and pumped up housing credit to get through the general election. Corbyn says we need to work together to shape a new economy. To shape that new economy we need to work together. It is only through effective co-operation between government and business, state and markets, public and private, education and enterprise. That we can build an economy for the future that delivers for all. Corbyn says he believes in the need for a new economic approach. And he also wants a new relationship with the rest of the world, based on trade, human rights and conflict resolution, he says. Corbyn says he published a paper on small business during his leadership campaign. There is a “magic circle” of advice that seeps into government thinking, he says. But he believes it is important to open up the policy-making process, so that a wider group of people contribute. Corbyn starts by praising his local cafe, which now employs six people after being set up a year ago. He understands the importance of enterprise, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is taking the stage at the BCC conference. The BCC figure introducing him says it is Corbyn’s first major speech to a business audience. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, will be giving his speech to the BBC conference at about 10.30am. Some excerpts have been released in advance. Here are some key points. Corbyn says Labour rejects “the failed economic orthodoxy” that has prevailed for a generaton. What Labour now stands for is far more than stopping the damage being done by this government and its threat to our long-term economic future. We want to see a break with the failed economic orthodoxy that has gripped the establishment in this country for a generation. We will put public investment in science, technology and the green industries of the future front and centre stage. Only by driving up the rate of investment will we achieve the higher productivity we need for rising living standards for all. He calls for a “new settlement with the corporate sector”. Only an economy that is run for the wealth creators - the technicians, entrepreneurs, designers, shopfloor workers, and the self-employed - and puts them in the driving seat ... is going to deliver prosperity for all. He suggests that New Labour’s light approach to regulation contributed to the financial crash. It wasn’t government that was the problem in 2007 and 2008, when the banking sector nearly drove the entire economy to the point of collapse. The New Labour approach was to opt for ‘light touch regulation’ of finance - and then sit back and collect the tax revenues. But you cannot base a decent social policy on an unsustainable economic policy. And we cannot outsource economic policy to the City of London. That has not served our economy well, and it has not served business well. He says that banking needs to be reformed, and that it should stop acting as “an extractive industry” treating customers “as a cash cow”. The banking sector has to be reformed. Finance must support the economy, not be an end in itself, and certainly not an extractive industry that looks at consumers, entrepreneurs and small businesses as a cash cow. We need a new ecology of finance. That means encouraging credit unions and better small business support. We need a national investment bank to target fund investment on what is in the public wage and wider economic interest, not just in the interests of quick returns. And we need to reform the major banks so that they serve the economy not just themselves. That includes using the public stakes in banks such as RBS to drive lending and investment in infrastructure, rebuilding supply chains and the industries of the future. He calls for more investment in superfast broadband. The evidence is clear that only the public sector and public investment can guarantee the super-fast broadband network in every part of Britain the essential low-cost connections people and businesses need in a 21st century economy,” he will say. As it is, government foot-dragging and ideological dithering is holding digital Britain back. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is deeply Eurosceptic and some thought he might decide to back Brexit. But, much to the relief of Number 10 (which was very worried about how it could argue leaving the EU would be bad for business if the business secretary was in favour) Javid decided to back Britain staying in. Taking questions at the BCC conference, he admitted that this had been a difficult decision, and that he said he was still “a Brussels basher”. In the Commons on Tuesday George Osborne, the chancellor, used a joke to criticise Labour for taking advice from Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. He told MPs: Frankly, the fact that the Labour Party is now getting its advice from Yanis Varoufakis and the revolutionary Marxist broadcaster Paul Mason does not suggest to me that they have got an answer to economic security. Presumably they chose those two because Chairman Mao was dead and Mickey Mouse was busy. Yaroufakis has now hit back. In an article for Newsweek, he includes a short open letter to Osborne. Dear George, Michael Gove, Michael Howard and Boris Johnson are arguing, against you, for Brexit on solid intellectual grounds concerning the EU’s curtailment of your Parliament’s democratic sovereignty. Even though our democracy was indeed crushed last summer by the EU, I happen to disagree with them. However, I am intrigued that you seem not to realize that by mocking me in that same Parliament you reinforced their already strong case for Brexit. My failure as finance minister was due to the ironclad determination of an authoritarian EU to continue with its failed Greek economic program. My ministry’s Policy Program for Greece, which Brussels pushed aside, I had put together with input from economic experts including Lord Lamont and [American economist] Jeff Sachs. I trust that, with hindsight, you would not have taken that cheap shot. It was one that the “Stay” campaign can ill afford. Priti Patel, the employment minister who is campaigning for Brexit, has used an article in the Times (paywall) to launch a strong attack on the CBI, claiming it has been consistently wrong about Europe. Here’s an excerpt. The CBI has consistently got the big decisions on Europe wrong. It called for UK membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Unfortunately, the government listened. The result was interest rates at 15 per cent, millions losing their homes, and one of our worst ever recessions. The CBI then campaigned to join the euro. Again it was wrong. In these debates, it relied on flawed polls and admitted it was ignoring the views of small businesses. Now it is campaigning for the EU. It claims that “eight out of ten firms say the UK must stay in the EU”. This poll was described as “dodgy” by the British Polling Council. The CBI is again ignoring the views of small businesses and entrepreneurs. It has welcomed almost every expansion of the EU’s powers. The CBI does not speak for British business. Patel concedes that multinational businesses are generally in favour of Britain staying in the EU, but she says “smaller businesses and entrepreneurs are more hostile.” As the Sunday Times’s David Smith points out, Patel is wrong about 15% interest rates. On Black Wednesday, as the value of the pound collapsed, the government announced that it would raise interest rates to 15%. But that rise never went ahead because Britain came out of the exchange rate mechanism (the ERM) instead. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is speaking at the British Chamber of Commerce conference now. Bloomberg have a live feed. Leave.EU has jointed Bernard Jenkin (see 9.11am) in accusing the French finance minister, Emmanuel Macron, of scaremongering in relation to the migrant camp at Calais. Its spokesoman Jack Montgomery has put out this statement. Just last month, the French government reiterated its sensible position that ‘calling for the border with the English to be opened is not a responsible solution.’ ‘It would send a signal to people-smugglers and would lead migrants to flow to Calais in far greater numbers’, the interior minister said. ‘A humanitarian disaster would ensue. It is a foolhardy path, and one France will not pursue.’ Absolutely nothing has changed, besides the need to scare British voters. To be clear, the Le Touquet treaty has only been in force since 2004. The migrant camps were in Sangatte before that time, not Kent, because France and the UK are separated by the English Channel. In fact, it was the French who wanted British money and personnel to assist in Calais, and the current arrangements were put in place at their request. I must stress that it’s a bilateral, government-to-government treaty, which has no more to do with our mutual membership of the EU than with our mutual membership of NATO. The real threat to our borders and our security are the European Court of Justice, which frequently prevents us from deporting foreign criminals and bogus asylum seekers, and EU threats to end the Dublin Regulation which allows us to send away migrants who have come to the UK through a safe country. Leave.EU is quoting Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, but Cazeneuve’s comments are from October last year, not last month (although French government sources said last month they still applied). David Cameron is in France today for a summit with the French president, Francois Hollande, and it will be another day dominated by news related to the EU referendum campaign. Here are the main overnight/morning developments. Emmanuel Macron, the French finance minister, has said that if Britain votes to leave the EU, the migrant camp at Calais could be moved to the UK. He also said the French would roll out “a red carpet” to welcome bankers fleeing London. He made his comments in an interview with the Financial Times. The paper reports: In an interview with the Financial Times, [Macron] also said he expected financial services workers in London to relocate to France once their institutions lost the “passport” rights that allow them to operate across the EU. “The day this relationship unravels, migrants will no longer be in Calais and the financial passport would work less well,” Mr Macron said. Echoing David Cameron’s invitation to French companies to relocate across the Channel when France raised taxes in 2012, Mr Macron said: “If I were to reason like those who roll out red carpets, I would say we might have some repatriations from the City of London.” The Guardian’s version of the story is here. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative MP and Vote Leave board member, has dismissed Macron’s comments as “propaganda”. In an interview with the Today programme Jenkin said Macron’s claim contradicted recent comments from French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said that opening the borders with the UK was a “foolhardy” option which the Paris government would not pursue. Jenkin said: That is the genuine line to take from the French government. What we are having now is propaganda being produced by other European governments at the request of the prime minister to try to scare people (out of) voting Leave. I don’t think responsible European governments are going to cut off their noses to spite their faces just because we vote to leave. It is obviously the safer thing for the UK to take back control over our borders, over our laws, over the money we send to the EU because then we can control our relations with our European partners. Boris Johnson has used an article in the Sun to accuse David Cameron of scaremongering about the risks of leaving the EU. He accused Cameron of “clutching the skirts of Brussels”. He also criticised Lord Mandelson, accusing him of acting like “some deranged Old Testament prophet” with his warnings about the consequences of Brexit. It will be an economic disaster, [Mandelson] says. We will lose trade, lose jobs, lose influence in Brussels. Well, he would have more credibility, frankly, if he had not said exactly the same thing 13 years ago. It is hard to think of a politician who has got it so spectacularly wrong. It would be comical, if it were not so sad. The bosses of more than 200 small firms have written a joint letter to the Daily Telegraph saying Britain should leave the EU. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has said that 77% of companies involved in the UK motor industry believe a vote to remain in Europe would be best for their business. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.20am: The British Chamber of Commerce conference opens. Jeremy Corbyn and Sajid Javid, the business secretary, are speaking in the morning. 9.30am: Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on full employment at the Resolution Foundation. 1pm: Jo Johnson, the science minister, gives a speech on science and the case for staying in the EU. Early afternoon: David Cameron and the French president Francois Hollande are expected to give a press conference at their summit in Amiens. 2pm: George Osborne, the chancellor, and Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, speak at the BCC conference. Today I will be focusing in particular on the Corbyn speech and the Cameron press conference. But I will be also covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. If you think there are any voices that I’m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I’m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include “Andrew” in the post). I can’t promise to include everything, but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/01/lib-dem-rebel-nuclear-power-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-01T19:36:00Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem MPs set to rebel against nuclear power 'subsidy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/01/lib-dem-rebel-nuclear-power-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/01/lib-dem-rebel-nuclear-power-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem MPs set to rebel against nuclear power 'subsidy'","bodyText":"A group of Liberal Democrat MPs are gearing up to rebel next week against a section of the government's finance bill which they believe gives a subsidy to the nuclear power industry. The coalition agreement rules out any new subsidy for nuclear power, and backbenchers in the party believe such a measure would represent as great a breach of trust with voters as breaking their promise on tuition fees. A large group of Lib Dems are concerned about clause 78 of the bill, which MPs will consider on Monday or Tuesday, that asks them to support a carbon floor price. This mechanism penalises fossil fuels but not low-carbon energy sources, such as nuclear and renewables, and the MPs believe it hands a large financial windfall to nuclear power – effectively a subsidy. The government has admitted that because of the size of the nuclear industry, it stands to gain up to twice as much as renewables from the proposed carbon floor price. In a written reply, the Treasury economic secretary, Justine Greening, said: \"The existing nuclear sector is likely to benefit by an average of £50m per annum to 2030 due to higher wholesale electricity prices. Similarly, the renewable energy sector is expected to benefit by an average of at least £25m a year to 2030.\" In a letter to the Guardian, one Lib Dem MP and three members of the federal policy committee – the party's ruling body that approves policy – warned: \"Support for a Conservative party-inspired policy on nuclear power must not become another tuition fee debacle for our party. We need to make a stand and ensure that the nuclear industry does not benefit from being an unintended beneficiary of tackling carbon emissions.\" The Guardian has also been told that the president of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, is so concerned about the legislation he has asked Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to withdraw the clause. However, it is thought the bill is too complicated to allow for one element to be unpicked. Instead Lib Dems would like to propose a \"windfall tax\" to claw back some of the financial gains they think the nuclear industry stands to make. A group of 21 Lib Dem MPs have signed anti-nuclear parliamentary motions since the formation of the coalition – over a third of the parliamentary party. The coalition agreement pledged that any new nuclear plants would be built without subsidy – the nuclear industry has long needed financial support to make it commercially viable, which its opponents believe skews the energy market in favour of nuclear and against renewables and other less-developed technologies. A report from the energy and climate change committee concluded: \"Government proposals will effectively provide subsidies to nuclear generators through new long-term contracts and a carbon price floor that could hand them windfall profits.\" Despite saying in 2007 that nuclear was \"tried, tested and failed\" technology, the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, appeared to give tacit support this week to new nuclear plants. In a document, Chris Huhne praised France's energy market, which gets 77% of its electricity from nuclear power as against 18% in the UK. \"Some countries already have a head start,\" he said. \"Electricity prices in France are set to rise by about 3% this year; compare and contrast with Britain, where prices are rising by three times as much. \"It is no surprise France is the European country with the least reliance on fossil fuels, and enjoys some of the lowest prices - 9.4% below ours.\" In the Daily Mail on Friday, backbencher Martin Horwood called for a windfall tax on the nuclear industry. Horwood said: \"There are going to be some pretty frank discussions about nuclear. There is growing unhappiness at the level of subsidies creeping in for the nuclear industry – they are being given millions of pounds for no change in behaviour whatsoever.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/03/nuclear-energy-wind-power-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-03T09:40:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear more popular than gas but wind blows both away | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/03/nuclear-energy-wind-power-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jul/03/nuclear-energy-wind-power-poll","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear more popular than gas but wind blows both away","bodyText":"Decision time is fast approaching for the UK's big energy and climate change choices, from how the government can keep companies interested in building new nuclear power stations to how quickly subsidies for new renewable technologies should taper down. So it's good to get a reminder of what the British people actually want, courtesy of a YouGov opinion poll, paid for by EDF. EDF, of course, is the nuclear giant 83% owned by the French state and just about the only serious nuclear power player left in the UK. But most of the questions asked were straight, although there were no questions on cost or energy efficiency. What the polling shows is that while nuclear power has survived a small dip in popularity following the Fukushima disaster, it remains short of an absolute majority. Wind power, in contrast, does. Those polled were asked \"how favourable or unfavourable are your overall opinions or impressions of the following energy sources for producing electricity currently?\" In June 2012, 40% were very or mainly favourable about nuclear power, compared to 36% shortly after Fukushima and 43% in 2008. Those expressing very or mainly unfavourable opinions on nuclear made up 27% of the poll in June, down from 34% after the Japanese catastrophe, and almost the same as the 28% in 2008. These results echo previous polls that showed the \"Fukushima effect\" was far more toxic in boardrooms - with companies such as RWE, E.on and Siemens pulling out of nuclear - than in people's living rooms. EDF's poll only asked about one renewable technology, wind power, but found it far more favourably regarded than nuclear, gas or coal. Favourable opinions were given by 58% of people in June, compared to 18% giving unfavourable opinions. But more striking is the drop in support for wind - it was 75% favourable in 2008 - and the polarisation of opinion - unfavourable opinion was 9% in 2008. Again, this is backed up by other recent polling, such as the Guardian/ICM poll in March. (I have blamed the lack of community ownership for drop in support). EDF then decides to probe the \"disadvantages\" that \"all methods of electricity generation have.\" It is noticeable that nuclear is not seen as the best option in dealing with any of the eight disadvantages mentioned. Price volatility is seen as a problem for gas (65%) but less so for nuclear (22%) and wind (15%). Nuclear predictably scores worst for safety, waste disposal and vulnerability to terrorist attack, with about 75% of people identifying these as disadvantages. Wind does worst on \"spoils the landscape\" and \"does not work continously all the time\". As regular readers will know, I think the first is an honest objection which also requires an honest acceptance to pay more for alternatives to onshore wind turbines. The intermittency issue is easily dealt with as, for example, demonstrated by Denmark. The disadvantage of \"dangerous pollution\" is an interesting one: 52% of people identify this as a problem for nuclear, clearly thinking of radioactive leaks rather the more important lack of carbon emissions. A smaller number, 43%, labelled gas as having the disadvantage of \"dangerous pollution\", despite its relatively high output of climate-warming carbon dioxide. The last findings I will highlight are, firstly, that 60% of people say they are aware that the closure of dirty and ageing coal and nuclear plants means the UK needs to fill an energy gap later this decade. Again people prefer wind over nuclear and both over gas. Secondly, 6% of people say they \"have heard about the government's energy reform plans and and understand them well\", while 33% say they have heard of them but don't really understand them. The rest, 61%, haven't heard of them at all. So what does all of the above add up to? For me, it is that people clearly understand the benefits of renewable energy and the problems of nuclear and fossil fuel power. Yet the government's current track, with its \"dash for gas\", desire for nuclear at apparently any price and lack of focus on cutting energy demand, seems significantly out of line with the electorate. Note: The polling was performed for EDF by YouGov. The total sample size was 4,009 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken 15-18 June 2012. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults aged 18+. I will link to the full data once is it posted online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-09T19:34:20Z","webTitle":"Fukushima's children at centre of debate over rates of thyroid cancer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima's children at centre of debate over rates of thyroid cancer","bodyText":"When doctors found several tiny nodules on his 12-year-old daughter's thyroid gland, Toshiyuki Kamei refused to let parental fear get the better of him. The symptoms are not uncommon, and the probability that they will develop into something more serious is low. Yet Kamei can be forgiven for occasional moments of doubt: his daughter, Ayako, is one of almost 400,000 children who were living in Fukushima on 11 March 2011 – the start of the world's worst nuclear accident for a quarter of a century. \"As a parent, of course I worry, but my daughter is taking it in her stride,\" said Kamei, who lives in Iwaki, a city about 40km (25 miles) south of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"She doesn't tell me if it's on her mind, and I've decided not to ask her about it.\" Three years after the plant suffered a triple meltdown that released huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere, medical authorities in Fukushima prefecture are reporting a significant rise in the number of thyroid cancer cases among local children and young adults. The results have prompted a bitter debate about the potential effects the meltdown had on the health of hundreds of thousands of children. Either the higher-than-normal rates of thyroid cancer are connected to the nuclear accident, or they are the inevitable result of a testing regime unprecedented in size, and conducted using state-of-the-art medical equipment. Last month, the number of confirmed and suspected cases of thyroid cancer among people aged 18 or below at the time of the accident rose to 75, compared with 59 at the end of last September. Of the current total, 33 cases have been confirmed as cancer. Under the guidance of Fukushima Medical University, local health authorities have so far tested 254,000 out of 375,000 Fukushima children and adolescents, who will continue to be screened regularly throughout their lives. Medical officials in Japan dismissed a link with the nuclear accident, but conceded that the results required further analysis. \"We hope to look for unknown types of gene mutations, other than those known to be associated with the generation of thyroid gland cancer, to study if they could serve as markers for determining if the cancers were induced by radiation,\" said Shinichi Suzuki, a professor of thyroid gland surgery at the university. At first sight, the figures give cause for alarm. Thyroid cancer normally affects one to two people per million among 10 to 14-year-olds in Japan, a rate far lower than observed in Fukushima, although tests there apply to people aged up to 18. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn with the 1986 disaster in Chernobyl. Estimates vary, but according to the UN Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer among exposed children and adolescents living in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus had been reported by 2005. There, no attempt was made to prevent children from drinking milk or eating leafy vegetables, leaving them vulnerable to ingesting dangerous amounts of the radionuclide iodine-131, a recognised cause of thyroid cancer. But experts familiar with both disasters caution against making similarly gloomy predictions for the children of Fukushima. Dillwyn Williams, emeritus professor of pathology at Cambridge University, pointed out that a noticeable increase in thyroid cancers was not observed until three to four years after the Chernobyl accident. \"Much less radioactivity was released from Fukushima than from Chernobyl,\" he said. \"Most of [the Fukushima radiation] was blown over the Pacific Ocean, and thyroid doses in the most-affected areas are low compared to Chernobyl. \"It is very unlikely there will be a large increase in thyroid cancer or any other health problems, apart from anxiety and psychological difficulties. That does not mean the surveillance should stop. There were surprises after Chernobyl and there may be again after Fukushima.\" Williams and other experts have attributed the large number of cases to the use of hypersensitive ultrasound, which can detect the tiniest lesions, and the large number of children being tested. In Fukushima, the first recorded cases of thyroid cancer – whose latent period can be between four or five years to several decades – came just a year after the meltdown. In Chernobyl, it took four years before cancer rates rose. \"The similarity in the public response to both accidents arises from a lack of awareness of the population about the real dangers and risks of radiation exposure,\" said Prof Konstantin Kotenko, director general of the state research centre at the Federal Medical Biological Agency in Moscow. \"After the both accidents the following was observed among the members of the public: fear and negative stereotypes due to exaggeration of the danger of ionising radiation, symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress. Undoubtedly, these perceptions of radiation have a negative impact on the health of the population, including children.\" Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College, London University, blames growing anxiety among Fukushima residents on \"pseudo-scientists who can shout louder than real scientists\". \"The biggest effect will be psychological – just as it was post-Chernobyl,\" said Thomas, who insists the rising number of cases is due to comprehensive screening, not radiation. \"I still stick with what I have always said: there will not be a single death due to the radiological consequences of this accident.\" But scientists have struggled to reach a consensus over the possible health effects of prolonged exposure to relatively low levels of radiation. While the World Health Organisation and other UN agencies praised the Japanese authorities for ordering the swift evacuation of neighbourhoods close to Fukushima Daiichi, their decision soon after to raise the allowable annual radiation exposure limit from one to 20 millisieverts [mSv] put children in danger, said Dr Paul Dorfman of the Energy Institute at University College, London. \"This is inexplicable, since 20mSv is the allowable dose for an adult radiation worker,\" Dorman said. \"Given that infants and children are still in their developmental stage, they should not have been subjected to this dose. \"Unfortunately, what this means is that we may be seeing increased ill health in the future. Not simply gross cancers and possibly heart problems, but also things that are difficult to detect through epidemiology, such as immune problems.\" The anxiety felt by parents in Fukushima stems from a widespread lack of trust in the local medical authorities, which have come under government pressure not to cause alarm among residents. The Japanese government has resisted calls from parents to conduct comparable screenings among children in a region of Japan that was not affected by the disaster. That, radiation experts say, would at least establish whether or not the thyroid cancer spike in Fukushima is out of the ordinary. \"It is such an obvious measure that could be completed in about six months, but the government has done absolutely nothing for three years,\" said Koichiro Ono, a local kindergarten teacher. \"The government is worried that if the results suggest that there is a link, it will ruin its plans to restart nuclear reactors.\" As north-east Japan prepares to mark the third anniversary of the disaster, in which almost 20,000 people died – most of them in two prefectures north of Fukushima – the country's leaders are trying to put a positive spin on the recovery effort. During a recent visit to a Fukushima village where the evacuation order imposed in March 2011 has been partially lifted, prime minister Shinzo Abe congratulated residents on taking a crucial step towards resuming the lives they were forced to put on hold after their homes were irradiated. Kamei, however, was not impressed. \"How can anyone talk about life returning to normal in Fukushima until everything has been done to ensure that people have their health?\" he said. \"Politicians keep talking about recovery, but that doesn't mean anything to people living around here.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/jul/25/centrica-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-24T23:03:01Z","webTitle":"City presses Centrica to cancel plans for building nuclear power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/25/centrica-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jul/25/centrica-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"City presses Centrica to cancel plans for building nuclear power plants","bodyText":"Centrica is being urged by the City to withdraw from a £4bn commitment to build new nuclear power stations in partnership with Electricité de France (EDF) amid soaring costs and delays at a prototype reactor at Flamanville in France.

Centrica should \"not touch with a barge pole\" the new nuclear build (NNB) joint venture with EDF to build four new plants in Britain, argues Lakis Athanasiou, utilities analyst with Evolution Securities. \"Centrica is a minority holder in a technology in which it has no institutional understanding, and where, as emphasised by Flamanville, construction risk is notorious. Centrica should not progress new nuclear further, particularly if [the] government is unwilling to take construction risk,\" he says. The Evolution view reinforces concerns expressed by other investment specialists such as Citigroup, which has previously questioned the economics of building new nuclear plants. It is a blow to EDF and the government, which are both keen to see ageing power stations replaced from a source that used to provide almost a quarter of Britain's electricity. EDF, mainly owned by the French state and the operator of dozens of atomic plants in its home territory, revealed last week that the cost of constructing the new power station in Normandy had almost doubled since its original budget. The building work has been hit by problems including accidents and the need for changes in the plant's construction after the explosion at the Fukushima plant in Japan, which was hit by the tsunami in March. It is now running four years behind schedule. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF in Britain, has admitted the schedule for opening new plants in the UK by 2018 is slipping but denies this is a delay. He says the company is just a \"taking stock\". The nuclear industry has a poor record of cost-overruns, once tracked in a study by Paul Brown, a visiting fellow at Cambridge university, and published under the title Voodoo Economics. Evolution Securities expects Centrica to show a slight dip in overall group operating profits to about £1.3bn, with its residential business showing profits down by almost half from £585m. Athanasiou says that without the 18% and 16% rises in gas and electricity prices announced recently, the company would have seen British Gas Residential Energy fall into a small loss. But that will do little to assuage consumer groups, who have been calling for widespread competition investigations into the actions of the big six power suppliers, which include British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy and EDF. The energy and climate change select committee will unveil a report on Monday calling for widespread action by the regulator, Ofgem, to ensure abuses are curbed. The committee is concerned that customers may be pressured into switching supplier on the doorstep when confronted with an array of complex tariffs and a hard sell. Figures from Ofgem suggest that up to 40% of consumers who switch do not end up with a better deal. Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said on Sunday: \"There is mounting concern in parliament about the doorstep selling techniques of large energy companies. If it turns out that consumers are being persuaded to switch contracts when it's not in their best interests, by salespeople keen to earn commission, then it would only be right for the energy companies to cough up compensation.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director at the consumer group Which?, said: \"People should be guaranteed the rate they sign up to and the right to get out of mis-sold tariffs. Where things do go wrong, they should get compensation or the difference back.\" Corporate results this week will reveal that the motorist's loss is the oil industry's gain as energy groups BP and Royal Dutch Shell prepare to report significant profits. Shell is expected to record a 43% surge in second-quarter profits to $6.7bn (£4bn) on Thursday, while on Tuesday BP is forecast to record a profit of $5.7bn for the three months to June. BP's figures for the same period last year were blighted by the Deepwater Horizon disaster which forced the group into a $17bn loss. Both groups have benefited from an oil price that has averaged more than $100 a barrel over the quarter, lifting petrol prices about 16% higher than last year. Last week a litre of unleaded petrol cost an average 135.8p. A spokesman for the AA said: \"Drivers will find it difficult to reconcile their predicament, with pump prices becoming unaffordable, with the big profits that oil companies are making.\" BP, mainstay of the FTSE 100 index, can at least argue that pension funds gain from its higher share price. BP stock has risen more than 50% since the Deepwater nadir. Airline passengers have had more shelter from the effect of high oil prices thanks to cut-throat competition between airlines. Nonetheless, fares have risen by about 5% in Europe this year, with business class passengers, deemed less sensitive to price hikes, on the receiving end of double-digit increases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2015/oct/21/jeremy-corbyn-faces-cameron-in-his-third-pmqs-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T16:58:08Z","webTitle":"Tom Watson gives evidence to MPs about his role in Leon Brittan affair – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/oct/21/jeremy-corbyn-faces-cameron-in-his-third-pmqs-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2015/oct/21/jeremy-corbyn-faces-cameron-in-his-third-pmqs-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Tom Watson gives evidence to MPs about his role in Leon Brittan affair – live","bodyText":"DCI Paul Settle said he sought investigative advise from the CPS and concluded that any action against Lord Brittan would be disproportionate as there were no reasonable grounds for prosecution. He said the matter was over 40 years old, the offence was not clear cut, and there was no right of anonymity for suspects arrested. Reading from his decision log, the officer referred to the interview with Brittan as “a baseless witch hunt”. He added that Watson’s letter confused matters significantly and shook confidence within his team “because it has kind of undermined us”. He confirmed, however, that info passed onto the Met by the MP has led to three successful prosecutions. DAC Rodhouse said the majority of delays in the investigation were due to “Lord Brittan’s health”. He denied that Brittan was interviewed because of Watson’s intervention, saying that the Met were not even aware of Watson’s letter until after the decision to review the case was made. He said there were reasonable grounds to suspect an offence had taken place and the Met merely followed the evidence. Tom Watson apologised to Leon Brittan’s widow for the distress caused as a result of the investigation. He said: I’m very sorry for the distress caused. I’m very sorry for the whole wider family. I know they are very angry and they clearly loved Leon Brittan very much. They are angry on behalf of their family member and I am sorry. I felt that peoples’ voices were not being heard and I felt responsibility for them. Watson said his intention was not to undermine Settle. He said he didn’t doubt the officer’s judgement until he met the victim for a second time and she was very distressed. “She felt so strongly about it that I felt that that was the right course of action... I didn’t do it with the intention of undermining DCI Settle...I did not want to micromanage a police inquiry,” he said. He added that he’s not responsible for the investigation, all he wanted to do was amplify victims’ voices. Alison Saunders concluded by emphasising that the CPS is not influenced by outside pressures. She said the CPS felt that, on the basis of the evidence shown to them, there was not a realistic prospect of conviction. “We made it clear from the very beginning where we thought the line was in this particular case and we maintained that line. They kept asking us to review that,” she said. That’s it from me today. Thanks for all your comments. Saunders says the CPS is not influenced by outside pressures. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, is now before the committee. Meanwhile, here are some key quotes from Watson, who said he was “sad” DCI Settle felt his letter to the DPP was a betrayal. I feel very sad that DCI Settle feels that because I had a very good working relationship with him. Neither of us really wanted to be in a position where there was such a volume of information that needed to be passed over to the police. That wasn’t my intention, to affect his career, I just wanted to make sure that Jane’s voice was amplified in the system. Watson also apologised to Lady Brittan, telling the committee: I’m very sorry for the distress caused. I’m very sorry for the whole wider family. I know they are very angry and they clearly loved Leon Brittan very much. They are angry on behalf of their family member and I am sorry. I felt that peoples’ voices were not being heard and I felt responsibility for them. Watson says he hopes we can create the public policy space which ensures victims of sexual crimes feel they will be taken seriously. Here’s a video of Watson apologising to Lady Brittan for the distress caused. Watson says as an MP you can only try and get people into the system and refer their allegations to the police. He admits he didn’t know what the victim was saying was true but felt the allegations should be fully investigated. Watson denies he was trying to play prosecutor and jury by sending the letter to the DPP. He didn’t doubt Settle’s judgement until he met the victim again, and she was very distressed. “She felt so strongly about it that I felt that that was the right course of action... I didn’t do it with the intention of undermining DCI Settle...I did not want to micromanage a police inquiry.” Watson is asked if he thinks the way the case has panned out will undermine the police in the future. “I hope that isn’t the outcome... it’s led to more people coming to my office in the past week.” Watson is being asked if he consulted the police before writing about Brittan for the Daily Mirror. He says no, but denies he was undermining the Goddard Inquiry. Watson is asked if he’s surprised he was called before the committee and Zac Goldsmith was not. “Very few things surprise me in Westminster,” he replies. Watson says he’s not responsible for the investigation. All he did was amplify people’s voices. He wanted to make sure they were not treating Lord Brittan differently. He says he went to the DPP rather than the officer on the case because he felt the DPP would give proper guidance on how to conduct the inquiry. Watson says he “certainly does not want to take part in baseless witch-hunts.” He says he doesn’t know what judgement the police made so he can’t say whether Settle’s comments were accurate. Watson says yes, he would describe himself as a campaigning member of Parliament, in the sense that “all MPs are campaigners”. He says he wasn’t looking to make this a big campaign, “it was the sheer volume of information that came through my office... I was actually trying to have a quieter life after the hacking inquiry.” Watson says his intention was to make sure the victim’s voice was amplified in the system. “There’s obviously a disagreement at the Met on whose judgement was right. I wasn’t aware of that.” When invited, Watson apologises to Lady Brittan: “I’m very sorry for the distressed caused.” He says he feels people’s voices were not being heard and he hopes the Brittan family can try and understand that. Watson denies he was trying to run the process, “nor was I anticipating the volume of information” that was supplied to him. Most MPs would think it is their duty to pass this information to the police to investigate. Vaz asks if Watson went beyond that duty, to the extent that an investigating officer met with him and explained why the investigation was being closed down. “When I met DCI Settle I wasn’t aware of the agenda, he raised this case but I didn’t understand that was the purpose of the meeting”. Watson says he saw Settle’s testimony today and he had a good working relationship with him and believes him to be a very good police officer. “I was not aware of the allegations he made in front of the committee until he made them”. Watson says his intention was not to undermine Settle. He says he accepted the officer’s judgement, and it was only when he met the victim for the second time, where she described the meeting she had with Settle which he himself said was not a pleasant meeting, that he realised she felt distressed. The victim raised a number of concerns about the decisions Settle had taken, Watson says. Vaz tells Watson he’s not Sherlock Holmes. Watson said he was asked to reassure public they would be treated seriously by the criminal justice system. Tom Watson is now before the select committee. Vaz reads Watson’s line about Brittan: “He was as close to evil as any human being could get”. Vaz says this is emotion and words used about someone Watson has never met. Watson says he regrets using that emotive language, but it wasn’t a phrase he used, one an alleged victim used. “I am sincerely sorry for repeating it, it was unnecessary.” Rodhouse says the decision to search Brittan’s home was not related to the rape allegation against him, rather a result of other “live” investigations. Keith Vaz jumps in quickly and says they don’t want to know about this. Rodhouse says the appropriate test to interview someone is a judgement call. “Lord Brittan could well have given a cast iron alibi” and the Met could then pursue malicious allegation charges. The issues that arise in an interview were not covered in Settle’s decision-making, he says. Rodhouse says the Met were not aware of Watson’s letter until after the decision to review the case and appeal to the CPS. Rodhouse says: “It was right in a case of such prominence to check we had got our decision right. There are a very small number of cases where the public interest is served by having the evidence reviewed.” He denies that Brittan faced a different test, police were just ensuring that test was being applied properly. He says he doesn’t agree with DCI Settle’s decision. “My view was that he should have conducted an interview.” He says there were reasonable grounds to suspect an offence had taken place. Other officers reviewing the case came to a different conclusion to Settle, he says. Rodhouse adds he does not believe the reviewing officer saw Settle’s decision log, but that’s not unusual. The first time Rodhouse looked at the log himself was some weeks ago, after the decision was made to review and appeal the decision. “It was my decision to appeal to the CPS,” he confirms. “This was a case where the facts were not clear cut.” Rodhouse says it’s important for the public to know police will investigate an allegation no matter who it is against. He says in this case the CPS advice was that the jury could be persuaded the incident took place but that Lord Brittan may not have been aware the victim did not consent. But when police spoke to Brittan, he denied that the incident took place altogether, which was used as evidence by the Met. Vaz says he is asking about procedure, not evidence. Rodhouse’s comments contradict those of DCI Settle. Settle said the decision to interview Lord Brittan was in his opinion a direct result of Watson’s letter to the DPP. The dates speak for themselves, he said. Watson sent the letter and less than a week later a review was launched. But Rodhouse denied that Brittan was interviewed because of Watson’s intervention. He said there were doubts over Settle’s decision on the case and that the Met followed the evidence. While there’s a break in the proceedings, it’s worth noting that Conservative members of the commons home affairs select committee have been accused of operating along “party lines” after rejecting calls for Zac Goldsmith to also give evidence. Goldsmith has been criticised by a family member of Lord Brittan and a former Conservative MP after he refused to withdraw claims made in parliament about an alleged paedophile ring in his constituency. Read my colleague Rajeev Syal’s full report on that below. Rodhouse says the majority of delays in the investigation were due to “Lord Brittan’s health”. He also denies that Brittan was interviewed because of Watson’s letter. Met officers Patricia Gallan, an assistant commissioner, and Steve Rodhouse, a deputy assistant commissioner, are now before the home affairs select committee. Meanwhile, here are some fuller quotes from DCI Settle: On the 4th September 2013, following advice I received from the Crown Prosecution Service...regarding police applying what is known as the code test I decided that the investigation should not proceed any further. My reason for that was that I concluded that any action against Lord Brittan would be grossly disproportionate and would not have a legal basis as in order to interview him we would have to have had reasonable grounds to suspect that an (offence) had been committed. The investigation had shown that whilst an allegation had been made, the offence had not been made out in law and as such those reasonable grounds had ceased. Settle revealed he decided not to interview Lord Brittan about the rape allegation because he feared it would be a “baseless witch hunt”. And he said that the late-peer’s eventual police interview was illegal because he felt it was not within the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). Reading aloud from his log notes which documented why he took the decision, he added: There is no right of anonymity for persons arrested for sexual offences and furthermore there is considerable media intrusion regarding arrestees. At the moment Lord Brittan is of interest to other aspects of a parallel investigation, and to arrest or interview him now would, I feel, jeopardise any potential inquiries as this would be nothing more than a baseless witch hunt. Settle said he did not think there were reasonable, objective grounds for the suspicion of rape based on known facts. He informed Watson of his decision not to interview Lord Brittan and said the MP “didn’t express any concerns whatsoever” at the time. Asked if he was surprised the investigation was reopened after Watson’s letter, he said: If I’m being frank I’m extremely disappointed because I would have thought before doing that I had the type of relationship with him where he could have phoned me to seek clarity, and had I not assured him of that clarity then he was perfectly within his rights to write that letter. But I was rather shocked. I saw it as a betrayal to be perfectly honest because I thought I’d been frank and honest with him and transparent from the outset. I saw it as a very low blow to be perfectly honest. Settle says if the full facts are looked at any police officer would have come to the same conclusion to not interview Lord Brittan. He admits his decision not to interview was influenced by “the prospect of adverse coverage” in the media. Settles says victims accounts are played out in the media, and if police are seen not to follow through what is seen as fact then they’re regarded as part of the problem. This can be deeply damaging to the pursuit of historic child sex abuse allegations. Settle says he met with Watson periodically. He says Watson wasn’t open to privileged information because “these people came from him, in any case he possessed the privileged information before we did.” But Watson wasn’t being involved in operational matters, he was supportive up until the letter arrived, he adds. Settle agrees that it was disproportionate for Watson to send the letter to the DPP before taking it to police. Settle is asked how he got into a position where he was undermined by Watson. “By doing my job,” he says. He explains the victim was interviewed by specialist officers who are particularly trained to deal with victims of sexual abuse. “It’s one area where we really go above and beyond to reassure the person”. He also says mishandling at an early stage of an investigation can have massive consequences at a later stage. “Our actions are all scrutinised”. The evidence led me to the conclusion that on the victim’s account the points to prove rape were not there. Though she was insisting she’d been raped, in law she hadn’t. Settle says there’s no feeling that Watson was wrong in bringing information to the police. He agrees that Watson is not a fantasist and carried out a public duty. In the context of the climate at the time, where Saville and Smith were not brought to justice, there was a feeling that the police had let people down, Settle says. But in the meeting with Watson on 10 February 2014 he explained why his decision on Brittan had been made. Settle says Watson’s letter confused matters significantly and shook confidence within the team “because it has kind of undermined us”. Settle explains that one reason he gave for not interviewing Brittan was so as not to “jeopardise other inquiries” into him. In his decision log, Settle refers to the interview with Brittan as “a baseless witch hunt”. He says he believes the interview was unlawful. Settle says he doesn’t regret giving too much information to Watson as it prevented speculation and inaccurate reporting. “I don’t regret keeping him informed because I’m a firm believer that once you’ve got a stakeholder in an investigation it does more harm to ostracise.” He also confirms that info passed by Watson has led to three successful prosecutions. Settle says he was extremely disappointed that the case against Brittan was reopened. He says Watson should have sought clarity from him. He says he saw it as a “betrayal” and “a very low blow”. He says it undermined his investigation, because Operation Yewtree was running at the same time, and his small team had a full diary and any distractions took them away from the job at hand. The matter was then reviewed by another senior officer who didn’t look at Settle’s decision log, he says. “That in my opinion wrongly concluded that the obvious line of inquiry was to interview Lord Brittan”. Settle says the review was a direct result of Watson’s letter to the CPS as the dates speak for themselves. DCI Settle is now before the home affairs select committee. He agrees with Keith Vaz that much of what he thought would be confidential regarding Lord Brittan is regrettably in the public domain. Settle says he sought investigative advise from the CPS and concluded that any action against Brittan would be disproportionate as there were no reasonable grounds for prosecution, based on the account the victim had given him. He says the matter was over 40 years old, the offence was not clear cut, and there was no right of anonymity for suspects arrested. Settle met with Watson occasionally as he was acting as an intermediary. At the time Watson didn’t express any concerns regarding Settle’s decision, he says. Other MPs who have paid tribute to Michael Meacher include former Labour leader Ed Miliband who he said was “principled, kind, thoughtful and deeply committed to a fairer, more just world”. Green MP Caroline Lucas said Meacher - who served as environment minister for six years under Tony Blair - was a “great politician, championing climate action”. Peter Dean, Meacher’s PA and office manager, told the Oldham Evening Chronicle: We are extremely sad and it has been quite a short illness he has had and we just don’t know the details at present. He was such a well respected person and we will just try to deal with any problems people in the area have ongoing. We will still try to assist in any way we can. We are extremely sad for his family but all of his staff here at his office have worked with him for 20 years so it is almost like a family bereavement for us. Our office usually deals with around 5,000 cases every year so he has impacted on an enormous amount of people’s lives. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson is due to give evidence at the commons home affairs select committee about his alleged role in the rape and paedophile investigations into Leon Brittan, the late Conservative peer. Education minister Tim Loughton, who sits on the committee, told the BBC on Monday that Watson had “rather set himself up as judge, jury and executioner over individual cases”. Brittan died in January without knowing that he had been cleared of suspicion over the allegation that he had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967. It emerged that Watson had previously written to the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, about the allegation when he learned that the police inquiry was being dropped. Watson defended his role in a recent blog, saying he had little choice but to pass on the claims. He also told parliament it was the children who had been the victims of abuse who deserved an apology after he was urged earlier in the day to “examine his conscience” by David Cameron. Last week the CPS said Watson’s letter was not passed to Metropolitan police detectives until after they had interviewed Brittan under criminal caution. The CPS that it had not pressured the police, but merely passed on the letter “to the relevant officer for their information”. DCI Paul Settle, the detective who quit as head of the VIP paedophile inquiry Operation Fernbridge after reportedly being undermined by Watson, will appear before the select committee first. It has been claimed by the Telegraph that Settle stood down from the inquiry following Watson’s letter. Settle’s appearance has raised objections from senior Met officers. The Met’s deputy commissioner, Craig Mackey, wrote to the committee arguing that MPs should not ask a relatively junior officer to appear before parliament. In a letter to Keith Vaz, the committee’s chair, Mackey said Settle’s appearance was inappropriate and had significant implications for the operational independence of the police. I’ll be posting key updates from Settle and Watson’s appearances. You can watch the proceedings live here. Veteran Labour MP Michael Meacher has died aged 75. Meacher had been MP for the Oldham West and Royton constituency since 1970. His office confirmed his death earlier today. Tributes have begun pouring in on Twitter. Corbyn has used PMQs to attack Cameron on his tax credits plans. The Labour leader quoted one of Cameron’s own backbenchers, Heidi Allen, who yesterday used her maiden speech to attack the government’s proposals. Cameron repeated his argument that the tax credits cuts should be seen as one of a range of measure, including raising the personal income tax allowance and reducing council house rents. He also took a swipe at Labour for the fact that the party’s deputy leader Tom Watson did not come vote in yesterday’s tax credits debate. The Speaker John Bercow sent a warning to the Lords not to over reach itself by blocking the government’s plan to tax credits saying “the constitutional position is clear and long standing.” He was speaking after the Conservative MP Edward Leigh said it was an ancient right of the Commons to make decisions on tax and spending. Bercow responded the Lords “can look after itself, but we also can and will look after ourselves”. The chancellor, George Osborne, is under renewed pressure over his £4.4bn plans to cut tax credits as the chairman of the government’s independent social security advisory committee, Paul Gray, urged the Treasury to set out the full impact of the policy. Gray told the Guardian that ministers had still not set out the full impact of the tax credit cuts nor explained what it means for universal credit, despite sending a letter on 9 September asking for more details. My colleague Nadia Khomami will be taking over shortly to cover Tom Watson’s appearance in front of the home affairs select committee this afternoon. Thanks for all your comments. A Labour spokesperson is denying Daily Mail claims that Corbyn made a joke about somebody’s wife being a prostitute to David Cameron during the Chinese president’s speech yesterday. Here’s a round-up of Twitter reaction to today’s PMQs. Many political journalists are saying that Corbyn’s performance is improving, but that he should have used all his questions to focus on tax credits. Some are arguing that Cameron struck the wrong tone on tax credits. The Labour party is highlighting Cameron’s use of language in his answer to one of Corbyn’s tax credits questions, specifically his use of the word “delight”. Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, has an email from a constituent from James Wharton, minister for the northern powerhouse, saying that some of the support package going to the redundant steel workers is going to pay their final salaries. Cameron says the government has done a lot to help the steelworkers, but adds: “Let me tell the honourable lady what we can’t do. wWe can’t, in this house, set the world price of steel”. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asks the prime minister about the threat that the opposition in the Lords will vote against the tax credit cuts. He says it would go against a convention established in 1678 and the sovereignty of the Commons. Cameron agrees with Rees-Mogg and says that MPs have voted in favour of the tax credits cuts twice now and that it would be an abuse of their power if peers were to vote against the measure. Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth, shadow minister without portfolio, his issued a statement on the prime minister’s response on tax credits today: David Cameron showed the true face of the Tory Party at PMQs today when he talked about his ‘delight’ at tax credit cuts. This Tory cut will mean over 3 million families losing on average £1,300 a year. It’s shameful that David Cameron is ‘delighted’ the cuts were voted through the Commons again last night. Despite his rhetoric yet again we see the Tory Party is not the party of the common ground. My colleague Rowena Mason gives a snap verdict on Corbyn’s third PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn is really getting the hang of this. He mixed his questions from the public up with some penetrating ones of his own and maintained authority with what is becoming a trademark acerbic school-masterly demeanour. The prime minister is already on the back foot over tax credits and the steel crisis so these were two easy subjects for Corbyn but it was overall a creditable effort that seemed to get Cameron slightly rattled. BINGO Iain Stewart asks about the nuclear deterrent. Cameron spots an opportunity. He says it’s disappointing to the country that the consensus on nuclear weapons has been ignored and that Corbyn is involved in CND. Frankly it’s today that we’re celebrating that great film Back to the Future and it’s not surprising that many people sitting behind him will tell him to get in his DeLorean and go back to 1985 and stay there. SNP MP Anne McLaughlin reads out child poverty figures for her constituency. Cameron says those figures have come after years of “the great tax credits experiment” and that a different approach is now needed. The SNP’s Angus Robertson asks about tax credits plans. “Does the prime minister have the faintest idea of the human cost of these plans?” says Robertson. Cameron repeats that families will benefit from other measures, such as the cut to council rents and the raise in the income tax allowance. Corbyn asks a question from Louie about a United Nations investigation into disability rights in the UK. Cameron says that, thanks to legislation passed by the last Conservative government, there have been tens of thousands of disabled people helped into work under the Tory government and that the UK has some of the toughest disability rights legislation in the world. Cameron says he’ll look into the UN investigation, but that his experience of such investigations is that they’re not always as they first appear. The prime minister met the member of parliament for Scunthorpe 11 months ago but is yet to ask the EU to help protect the British steel industry, says Corbyn. We have been talking to Europe “for months”, says Cameron. The government has been working to stop the practice of “dumping”. Corbyn asks a question from a steelworker in Scunthorpe who wants to know what the prime minister has done to help the steel industry. Cameron says the global market for steel is difficult and says the government has done a lot to promote the British steel industry. Corbyn says “isn’t the real problem that the government doesn’t actually have an industrial strategy?” The government has been dragged “kicking and screaming” to the commons to answer questions on the subject, he says. “This all very strange because the prime minister seems to have changed his mind,” says Corbyn. He reads out a question from John who asks why Cameron went on TV and said he wouldn’t cut tax credits before the last election. Cameron says something “quite strange” happened last night which is that Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, didn’t turn up to vote in the tax credits vote yesterday. Jeremy Corbyn is up. We’re returning to the PM’s favourite subject of tax credits, he says. Corbyn reads out quotes from Heidi Allen’s speech yesterday and asks “where was she wrong?” The cuts to tax credits are part of a package, says Cameron. “Let’s make work pay”. He says he’s delighted that the measure passed through the commons again last night. Here’s a mini explainer of tax credits: Susan Elan Jones, MP for Clwyd South, asks the prime minister about Sunday trading laws. The prime minister says there’s a “strong case for change”, but that local authorities should decide what is best for their area – something that will be in the Cities and Devolution Bill. He says you can shop on the internet on a Sunday and that it’s time to modernise. The house is filling up in advance of PMQs. The Daily Mail has asked lip reading experts to look at the film of Jeremy Corbyn’s and David Cameron’s awkward looking exchange as they waited to hear Chinese President Xi Jinping give his speech yesterday. According to the lip readers, Corbyn said to the prime minister: “It was difficult because, erm, that’s his ex-wife who is, erm, apparently an ex-prostitute”. It is not clear who he was talking about. David Cameron then went on to talk about the levels of self-employment “falling gradually”. “That’s right, absolutely, that would be more interesting,” Corbyn responded. The exchange prompted fevered speculation on social media yesterday about what the two could have said to each other. Bets are on for how many Back to the Future gags there are in today’s prime minister’s question time. The Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils and boroughs across the country, has called for headteachers to be able to approve pupils taking family holidays in term-time, a move that would end a controversial policy that has led to a sharp rise in the number of parents being fined for unauthorised absences. Schools minister Nick Gibb was on the Today programme earlier defending the current policy: We tightened the rules, but the rules have always been... that you should not take time out of terms to go on holiday, but there was an impression given that every parent was entitled to two weeks leave to take a child on holiday. That was increasing, it wasn’t just one or two children… it was increasing. If you do this, you can disrupt the teachers planning of their lessons, you affect the education of other children, but it also affects the child themselves. Because our data shows that just a week off per year as leading up to GCSE courses can reduce the chances of that child getting good GCSE’s by about a quarter. Labour MP John Woodcock doesn’t seem too happy with the news that Guardian journalist Seumas Milne has been appointed as Corbyn’s head of communications. Today’s Sun newspaper has a good quote from a senior Number 10 aide. Asked about Boris Johnson’s increasingly eurosceptic murmerings, the aide said: Boris is bored. He will do anything to grandstand on the world stage. The aide told The Sun that rumours that Johnson would get a cabinet role in charge of infrastructure when he steps down as London mayor were unfounded and that he would get a “ceremonial” post. The London mayor and MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has flirted with throwing his weight behind the campaign to leave the European Union in the upcoming referendum. Speaking to the BBC while on a trip to Japan last week, Johnson said: “I think I am exactly where the prime minister is and, I think, actually a huge number of the proportion of the British public. “We want, in an ideal world, to stay in a reformed European Union but I think the price of getting out is lower than it’s ever been. It’s better for us to stay in, but to stay in a reformed EU. That’s where I am.” So, it’s officially ‘Back to the Future Day’ – meaning it was this day (21st October 2015) that Michael J Fox travelled back to in the 1989 blockbuster Back to the Future Part II. While the Guardian is running a live blog to mark the day, the department for work and pensions has decided to use the day to promote its workplace pensions campaign. A giant fluffy creature called Workie is the new face of the department’s workplace pensions campaign. Workie made his TV debut on Tuesday night in an ad break between Emmerdale and Coronation Street on ITV. Pensions minister, Ros Altmann, who was personally involved in designing Workie, said: This is a fun and quirky campaign but behind it lies a very serious message. We need everyone to know they are entitled to a workplace pension – and we need all employers to understand their legal responsibility to their staff, but also to feel more positive about engaging with workplace pensions. Here’s a round up of political stories you may have missed this morning. Guardian journalist Seumas Milne has been appointed executive director of strategy and communications for the Labour party. Labour’s statement announcing Milne’s appointment says he will be joining “on leave” from the Guardian, suggesting at a point in the future he will be free to return. He will take over on 26 October. As well as the news of the investment by China’s state nuclear power companies in Hinkley Point in Somerset, the government has announced a relaxation of the visa rules for Chinese tourists, slashing the price for a two-year multiple-visit UK visa from £324 to £85. If the new system is a success, special 10 year visas for Chinese tourists will be introduced for the first time. Secret research by the Labour party, passed to The Independent, concludes that the party must tackle its “deep and powerful negatives” on the economy and welfare if it is going to win a general election. The research, conducted through focus groups, suggested that swing voters who have deserted Labour see the party as standing “for down and outs, not people like me.” The commons work and pensions select committee has said that nearly 70% of people who go through the government’s £5bn Work Programme – launched by the coalition in 2011 – fail to find sustained employment. The scheme was “not working well” for people with complex problems, but was “at least as good” as its predecessors, said the MPs. The CBI has signalled its determination to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU. The UK’s leading business group published a glossy report, Choosing Our Future, on Wednesday, liberally sprinkled with quotes from companies and trade bodies about the boost to their bottom line from remaining in the European single market. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, has been judged the most influential Asian person in Britain, topping a list of 101 prominent people including Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai, musician Zayn Malik and artist Sir Anish Kapoor. It has emerged that Jeremy Corbyn’s head of policy, Andrew Fisher, posted on Twitter that it was “fitting that the architect of Labour’s miserable austerity-lite economic policies should lose #Balls”. Labour MPs have asked Corbyn why he appointed Fisher, who also described the Labour front bench as “the most abject collection of complete shite” in September last year. Jeremy Corbyn will face David Cameron for his third appearance at prime minister’s question time today at midday. Corbyn held what Labour described as “cordial and constructive” talks with the Chinese president Xi Jinping at Buckingham Palace yesterday. They had a 30 minute private meeting and, according to a Labour spokesperson, discussed: ...the history of links between the UK, the Labour Party and China, in particular the huge contribution and sacrifice of the Chinese people in the struggle against fascism during the Second World War and the Labour Party’s commitment to build constructively on that history.... Jeremy also raised the issues of human rights and the impact of Chinese imports on the UK steel industry. Later this afternoon, around 2.30pm, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson will give evidence at the commons home affairs select committee to be grilled about his alleged role in the rape and paedophile investigations into Leon Brittan, the late Conservative peer. Education minister, Tim Loughton, who sits on the committee, told the BBC on Monday that Watson had “rather set himself up as judge, jury and executioner over individual cases”. No charges were ever brought about the people that have been named by Tom and now he is made to look rather silly.

About 42% of people had no knowledge of CCS, which is posited by the government's climate advisers as a way of helping the UK take carbon out of electricity generation, while continuting to use fossil fuels such as gas, within the next two decades. There are still no functioning commerical scale CCS units on power stations, however, and a long-running government competition offering as much as £1bn to a company willing to build one has suffered numerous setbacks. People would only be marginally more enthusiastic about having a nuclear power station built within five miles of their homes – slightly more than half the population, about 54%, would oppose such a siting. The findings came in a three-year research project run by the UK Energy Research Council aimed at finding out what people think about the future of energy, through a major nationwide survey and six focus groups carried out by Cardiff University. A large majority of people – 74% – said climate change was a threat. But the poll failed to ask people about one of the most controversial energy issues facing the UK, that of the exploitation of shale gas in areas such as Lancashire and Sussex. The survey also found that awareness of renewable heat technologies, for which the government announced incentive levels for householders last week, was low. The Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body set up under the Climate Change Act to advise ministers on how to meet long term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, has said that about 600,000 heat pumps will need to be in use by about 2020 in order to meet current targets, but even industry insiders see this as unlikely to come to pass. In the poll of 2,442 people across the UK, about three quarters said they were concerned about climate change, a similar number supported renewable electricity generation and a slightly higher number (79%) said they felt the amount of fossil fuel use should be cut. There was also high support for solar power – about 85% backed it – and more than four in five people expressed concern that the UK was becoming too dependent on imports of fuel from overseas. Researcher Dr Catherine Butler said: \"People are still very much favourable to renewable energy even when it is suggested it is significantly more expensive.\" The researchers who carried out the UKERC study, which has been running since 2011, said the results clearly showed that most people are in favour of changing the energy system to use more renewable power and cut carbon emissions. However, it is unclear from the results how people would prefer this transition to be paid for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/mar/15/usdomesticpolicy-why-we-still-need-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T12:29:25Z","webTitle":"The difficult truth about nuclear power | Michael Tomasky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/mar/15/usdomesticpolicy-why-we-still-need-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/mar/15/usdomesticpolicy-why-we-still-need-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"The difficult truth about nuclear power","bodyText":"This may turn out to be the very worst day in recent human history to say this, I am aware, but I'll say it anyway. The Obama administration is correct to say that the US needs to continue to pursue building more nuclear power plants. I'm first and foremost for expanding wind and solar and other alternatives. If I lived in a rational country, we'd have a policy in place on a national level like Gainesville, Florida's evidently successful solar policy, but by Washington standards that's socialism, so we can't have that. But even if we did do something rational around solar and wind and other alternatives, given energy needs we'd still need to expand either fossil fuels or nuclear, and nuclear doesn't contribute to global warming. Nothing is without risks in life, and as we might learn soon here, nuclear carries with it very high risks indeed. You can see on this map that they don't like nuclear plants much in our own earthquake-prone west. Obama has wanted more money for investment in nuclear. From NPR: President Obama has expanded on Bush's nuclear energy push. Last year, the Obama administration used $8.3 billion from funds set aside by the Bush administration to help construct two reactors in Georgia. Obama's budget, released last month, calls for $36 billion in loan guarantees for further nuclear power plant construction. It's that pot of money that will now be subject to greater scrutiny in Washington. On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which had already been set to look into energy and nuclear funding, is set to question Energy Secretary Stephen Chu and other administration officials about the incident in Japan and its meaning for the U.S. The new House Republicans want more, I see: It's been 24 long years since Congress designated the [Yucca Mountain] site in the southern Nevada desert as the best place to store the nation's nuclear waste. While opponents have gained the upper hand in trying to block the project in recent years - in 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said, \"Yucca Mountain as a repository is off the table\" - a group of House Republicans is fighting back. They want to revive the site as part of a broader plan that calls for building 200 nuclear-power plants by 2030. Under that plan, the nation would begin building nuclear plants on an unprecedented scale. Currently, the nation gets 20 percent of its electricity from 104 nuclear reactors. The desire to revive Yucca Mountain is probably driven by politics, i.e., it will embarrass Harry Reid. And these Republicans, being extremists in general, are probably being extreme in calling for 200 plants. But it is true that new nuclear facilities are and can be far, far safer than old plants like the one now on the edge in Japan, which is 40 years old. Will Saletan of Slate does a good job here of explaining how much safer in general things have become. I'm sitting here at my computer at home, drinking the coffee I brewed this morning on my plug-in maker, using a lamp, even a little space heater for my feet. I don't regard any of these things as luxuries, particularly, and I and many millions like me are probably unwilling to give these things up. One of these days, I am indeed going to put solar panels on my house. The only reason I haven't done so yet on this house is that we may move. So I'm prepared to spend many thousands of dollars to do my part. But everyone can't do that (because it's socialism etc.). We basically have to chose whether to expand in fossil fuels or nuclear, and while both have downsides, the latter is the less bad choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2014/jun/21/bart-of-darkness-mr-burns-common-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-21T09:00:59Z","webTitle":"From the Bard to Bart: how Mr Burns challenges our common culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/21/bart-of-darkness-mr-burns-common-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2014/jun/21/bart-of-darkness-mr-burns-common-culture","fields":{"headline":"From the Bard to Bart: how Mr Burns challenges our common culture","bodyText":"One of the most tantalising lost works of literature is an epic poem by Homer called Margites, which, unlike the Odyssey and Iliad, has not survived and is known from a reference by Aristotle. So a cultural commentator seeking a neat historical contrast might be tempted to observe that, while Homer's Margites has vanished from culture, Marge's Homer never will owing to the vast existing digital archive of episodes of The Simpsons. However, a fascinating and provocative new American play – Mr Burns by Anne Washburn, which has just received its UK premiere at the Almeida theatre in London – imagines a world in which Homer Simpson has, like his Greek first-namesake, been partly wiped out. The opening act plays out on an almost dark stage, illuminated only by spasmodic flashlight and the flames of a campfire, around which huddle the survivors of a near-futuristic American catastrophe caused by the meltdown of nuclear power stations. This homeland Chernobyl has destroyed all electronic entertainment present and past, with the result that groups of survivors compete to recreate, through oral story-telling, favoured episodes of network TV shows such as The Simpsons. Seven years on, in the second act, these broadcasting restorationists have organised into a primitive industry. Rival troupes of travelling players, with names such as The Prime-time Players, The Reruns and Richard's Couch, tour the scorched states, performing by candlelight reconstituted adventures of Homer and Marge and their children – though one group resurrects instead The West Wing, with its now novel concept of national government – and buying extra lines of remembered dialogue from locals. But, in one of Washburn's smartest touches, these mocked-up comedies are just a show within a show, framed by recreated scenes of the domestic life destroyed by the apocalypse – including coming home from work, baths, food and wine – and reenactments of old TV ads for domestic necessities that now seem as unlikely as unicorns. As one character comments of these pastiche commercials: \"It's that fine line between tantalisation and torture.\" A further 75 years have passed before the final section, which consists entirely of a performance of \"Mister Burns\", a one-act opera (composed by Orlando Gough and Michael Henry) in which Bart Simpson has become a Perseus-like hero, seeking to save his country from the evil central character, in a narrative that resembles a Chinese-whispered version of the Simpsons episode \"Cape Feare\" (Season 5, Episode 2, 1993), mixed up with snatches of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and early 21st-century pop songs, including Britney Spears' \"Toxic.\" As often happens to brilliantly original and provocative plays, Mr Burns has met critical hostility and mystification, although the main objection of detractors oddly serves to make what Washburn has written seem even more timely and apposite. Tim Walker, in the Sunday Telegraph, accused the play of pointless obscurity: \"Theatre is always an opportunity to connect with an audience and never before have I seen the opportunity so wilfully squandered. Experimentation is one thing, but this is a play that can only possibly put people off theatre.\" The London Evening Standard's Henry Hitchings also issued a warning to potential ticket-buyers: \"If you're a fan of The Simpsons with an appetite for risk-taking theatre, its strangeness will be irresistible. Others are likely to find it impenetrable and pretentious.\" Though kinder, awarding three stars out of five, Michael Billington of the Guardian, concluded: \"It feels like a cult show; one that will primarily appeal to Simpsons addicts.\" What fascinates me about these reactions is that Washburn stands accused of writing a play with a narrow frame of reference, although the American cartoon she invokes has been seen by hundreds of millions of viewers, rather than the average thousands who attend a new play at a small theatre. Drawing on some of the most popular images and stories of our time, the dramatist is paradoxically charged with a sort of elitism by reviewers who either don't recognise or don't respect her references. So, inadvertently, the reviews are raising the question that Mr Burns itself asks: what constitutes a common culture? Judging which allusions are universal (or at least broadly recognisable) is a recurrent dilemma for all sections of the entertainment business. The concern that an audience \"won't get it\" is the most usual justification for cutting TV and radio scripts, fictional and journalistic alike. Such comments can reflect an assumption that the consumers are less educated than the producers, but it is also becoming harder to assess what people know. Tom Stoppard has said that classical and literary allusions that seemed easily recognisable when his plays Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and Jumpers were premiered in the 60s and 70s often mystified theatre-goers at revivals decades later because of a shift in the definition of what it meant to be well educated. The increased patchiness and shallowness of the collective cultural memory is one reason that Tudor history has become so popular, through the best-selling novels of CJ Sansom, Philippa Gregory and Hilary Mantel and the current blockbuster stage productions based on Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies. Since Christianity ceased to be mainstream in Britain, the story of Henry VIII's uxoricides is one of the few narratives that a cross-section of society and generations could be expected to recognise. And Mike Poulton's theatrical adaptations of the Mantels also make canny use of one of the country's few other general points of reference – the comedy of geographical stereotype – with references to \"Yorkshire\" and \"Stoke Newington\" winning big and knowing laughs. The critical reception for Mr Burns illustrates the increasing discrepancies in general knowledge. A teenager unfamiliar with theatre would find Mr Burns easily comprehensible; but, to a theatre critic who doesn't watch much TV, it seems impenetrable. However, at Turgenev's Fathers and Sons at the Donmar, another recent London opening, reviewers would be more at home than most couch potatoes. But, at these two performances, which section of which audience can be regarded as dumb or cultish? In this piece, I am tempted to say that the most suitable word of praise for Mr Burns is \"excellent\". If you know The Simpsons, you will know why; if you don't, you won't. But the fact that there is a third subset of readers who may have learned the catchword of Homer Simpson's boss through seepage from children or grandchildren is a further validation of Washburn's theme and thesis. Mr Burns subtly dramatises the process of cultural transmission in a mass media era. In Washburn's post-apocalyptic world, the works of Joseph Conrad, William Shakespeare and Tennessee Williams apparently survive only in episodes of The Simpsons punningly titled \"Bart of Darkness\" , \"Much Apu about Nothing\" and \"A Streetcar Named Marge.\" So, although the playwright says in a programme note that the choice of The Simpsons as the show-within-the-play was \"a lightly made decision\" and she might easily have gone for Friends instead, her play gains an extra layer of meaning from the fact that Matt Groening's cartoon series is itself a complex web of references to art of the past. As its title acknowledges, the \"Cape Feare\" episode is mainly influenced by cinema, although the thriller Cape Fear exists in both a 1962 version directed by J Lee Thompson and a 1991 Martin Scorsese remake; a distinction discussed by the play's characters. But, as well as the quotations from those films, the script also samples Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado and HMS Pinafore. Some critics seem not to have appreciated that the Savoy operetta references in Mr Burns came via The Simpsons, rather than being a random artistic garnish on Washburn's stew, which again demonstrates how the reception of a show can be affected by what audiences know. During the performance I saw at the Almeida, for example, there were two varieties of laughter: a communal guffaw at jokes that arise from the context of the play and a smaller giggle of recognition at the Simpsons references or Madonna or Chris Isaak lyrics. The reaction when a portrait of President Clinton is revealed on a wall of the set seemed to split between liberal theatregoers rippling with pleasure at the politician's image and those clocking yet another allusion to the \"Cape Feare\" Simpsons episode, in which a Clinton picture figures. It is also possible to know things unknowingly. One of the cleverest moments is when a newly arriving survivor is able to fill in missing elements of the \"Cape Feare\" dialogue and the trio of three little maids from The Mikado, even though he admits he has never seen a whole episode of The Simpsons. One line had been drilled into his mind by a girlfriend annoyingly obsessed with the series, and he assimilated Gilbert and Sullivan through membership of a light operatic society. That conversation shows a sophisticated understanding of how the diffusion of themes and ideas works. I remember an Irish writer at a literary festival once quoting the comment of a Dublin taxi driver on a Taoiseach of the time – \"to be sure, he has a picture in the attic\" – as evidence that even a hired driver in the city had read Oscar Wilde's A Portrait of Dorian Gray. But, while Ireland would be a candidate for the nation with the most-literate population, it was equally possible that the cabbie had picked up the image of the artistic deal with the devil from everyday discourse, into which Wilde's story had long ago passed. And, while Washburn's detractors seem to have assumed that the author is endorsing a culture in which Bart is more significant than the Bard, she seems to me to be more neutrally presenting the way in which cultural history accrues through allusion, osmosis and confusion. The production (director Robert Icke, designer Tom Scutt) includes a tremendous visual gag in which, in the climatic musical performance, the spiky hairdo of Lisa Simpson has become blurred in the visual memory with the barbed helmet of the Statue of Liberty. In that respect, the play is subject to a final irony. In the published text of Mr Burns (Oberon Books), there are two places where stage directions – \"Microbeat of Maria doubt\" and \"She might be near tears at this point\" – have accidentally been printed as dialogue. This raises the possibility that, in future productions of the text without the author present, an actor may, in a version of the transcription errors with which Shakespeare's plays are thought to be littered, speak these puzzling lines, perhaps delivering them as knowing Brechtian asides to the audience. As a result, Mr Burns itself could suffer the sort of cultural mistransmission that is its subject. And, according to Aristotle, the protagonist of the lost poem by the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey was \"an uncommonly dumb man\". As, indeed, is the hero of a popular TV comedy 28 centuries later. So Homer's Margites and Marge's Homer have more in common than we thought, but, if Washburn's pessimism about electricity is correct, may one day both be known only through flickering reminiscence. • Mr Burns is at the Almeida theatre, London N1, until 26 July.

These are extra costs levied on household gas and electricity bills to pay for low-carbon energy sources such as windfarms and solar panels. The government has always insisted the charges will help cut energy bills in the long run by reducing Britain's dependence on fossil fuels at the same time as helping to tackle climate change. They currently make up 9% of household bills and are projected to make up 14% by 2020. What are the main ones and how much do they cost? There are various initiatives that are paid for through household bills, costing people around £112 of an average £1,267 annual bill. Schemes that help pay for windfarms, solar panels and other renewable energy cost around £53 a year, while other programmes to help poor and vulnerable customers cost around £58 a year. • The renewables obligation costs households around £30 a year and has been running since 2002. It is a requirement on energy companies to source some of their energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar. It will increase by about 70% by 2020, before falling again to below current levels by 2030. • Feed-in tariffs are a subsidy for small-scale renewables such as wind turbines and solar panels on domestic roofs. They were brought in under the last government and cost households around £7 a year. The cost is expected to roughly double by 2020. • The energy company obligation was brought in by the coalition and will cost households between £47 and £50 a year. It is a requirement on the big firms to help poorer households cut their energy usage. Its annual costs are predicted to increase only slightly. • The warm home discount is another coalition scheme that gives elderly and vulnerable households a £135 discount on their electricity bill over the winter months. It costs most households around £11 a year and is not expected to rise. • The European Union emissions trading scheme, enshrined in EU law, and carbon floor price, brought in by the coalition, are two schemes that raise the price of generating electricity from fossil fuels, making it more attractive for companies to use clean sources. They do this by forcing major industrial companies to buy permits to cover the cost of the carbon they emit. Together they cost households £13 a year. However, the costs will go up very sharply over the next two decades to around £115 a year by 2030 (although this does not take into account predicted lower energy usage). • Smart meters cost households around £3. The intention is for every house to have a new hi-tech meter to give customers more information about their usage and allow more accurate billing. It should help consumers see where they are wasting energy and enable them to cut back. By 2020 they should be providing large savings on people's energy bills. Are there any new schemes in the pipeline? Yes, the main one is to help pay for the cost of nuclear power and backup electricity generation under the coalition's electricity market reforms package. This will put an extra £47 on household bills in 2020 and £114 in 2030 (again, this does not take into account reduced energy usage). Why does the Department of Energy say these green levies will help consumers? Ed Davey, the energy secretary, says the whole package of measures will mean bills are £166 lower than they otherwise would have been. This is because switching to renewables and nuclear will reduce reliance on gas prices, which have been rising steadily. The government also has a programme of initiatives to cut energy usage and believes people will move to more energy-efficient household appliances. Why is the prime minister pledging to roll back green levies then? Cameron is under pressure to bring down energy bills after Labour said it would introduce a price freeze. Backbench Tories have also campaigned against giving so much in subsidies to renewable energy. Will he be able to get this past the Lib Dems? The Liberal Democrats would strongly resist anything that would prevent the UK meeting international obligations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Despite Cameron's claim that green charges were imposed when Ed Miliband was energy secretary, the majority of levies were introduced by the coalition under the direction of Ed Davey and Chris Huhne, two Liberal Democrat energy secretaries. After the announcement, the Lib Dems said: \"We will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy.\" However, it is possible the coalition could choose to fund the subsidies out of general taxation. This would help counter the criticism that imposing green levies through energy bills hits the poor hardest, but take away an extra incentive on people to use less energy. This is what happened in the case of another green scheme, the renewable heat incentive, when the government decided it was putting too much of a burden on bills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2013/may/01/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-01T13:44:37Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Pesticide ban, carbon levels and indigenous rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/01/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/may/01/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Pesticide ban, carbon levels and indigenous rights","bodyText":"Environment news • Bee-harming pesticides banned in Europe • UK government failing legal duty on air pollution, supreme court rules • Global carbon dioxide levels set to pass 400ppm milestone • Grand Canyon uranium mining set to go ahead despite ban from Obama • BP makes record profit as its safety record comes under spotlight again • Adapt faster to changing climate, Europe warned On the blogs • George Monbiot: Stewards of the natural world do not understand the precautionary principle • May's diverse wildlife finds hedgerows the perfect home • Bee deaths: Should the EU ban neonicotinoids? • PR smokescreen cannot hide the holes in climate teaching proposals • What's climate scientist James Hansen's legacy?

The film version of Dr No, first screened 50 years ago and still a TV favourite, and other Bond movies have helped frame public perceptions of the hazards of nuclear power along with accidents such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, according to David Phillips, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He feared the portrait of the evil megalomaniac and his nuclear reactor hidden away on a Caribbean island contributed to the \"entirely negative\" and \"remorselessly grim\" perception of the industry as a force for evil. Phillips told the BBC that when nuclear power was discussed \"it is not at all surprising that the public at home and abroad are sceptical\". But he said the society believed \"nuclear power has to be part of the future national energy mix, in which it plays a major role, complemented by renewable sources. Fossil fuels have to be eradicated for people to live in a healthy environment.\" \"Let's say yes to nuclear and no to Dr No's nonsense,\" he added. Anti-nuclear campaigners were not convinced. \"Although James Bond is fiction, the truth is that nuclear power is dangerous, dirty and unsafe,\" Penny Kemp, spokesperson for the Green party said. \"It is improbable to think that people's perceptions have been influenced solely by The World is Not Enough, but this film came after the Chernobyl disaster so the film was merely picking up on a real fear people have of nuclear power. And rightly so.\" Richard George of Greenpeace said: \"A handful of Bond films haven't tarnished the nuclear industry's reputation. They have managed to do that all by themselves. I don't think they have got a top secret fake volcanic island though. But if they did, it would probably be cheaper to build than a nuclear power station.\" A glance at the society's website shows its members too enjoy Bond stories, incorporating them into scientific explanations. It tells how the spy is brought low by a poisonous chemical administered by evil Rosa Kleb in the book of From Russia with Love, although it is not until the following novel, Dr No, that its identity is revealed as tetrodotoxin or fugu poison.

There is general consensus that fisheries should be managed to protect their biomass and allow a level of harvesting that is sustainable to the stock and other parts of the marine ecosystem and that illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing should be prevented. Assuming this is in place, the fish can enter various channels to market and, in a free market, the fishers should decide who buys their catch, subject to local regulations. The growth of the global farmed fish industry has created a strong demand for fishmeal (protein) and fish oil, increasing the price paid to fishers for small, bony fish that often have limited or no human consumption markets. It has also encouraged the recycling of fish offal and by-products which now comprise around 35% of the total raw material used. Farmed fish is providing increasing volumes of valuable protein and is recognised as a key component of global food security. As farmed fish diets now contain more vegetable than fish, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that for every 0.3kg of whole fish used in feed, 1kg of farmed fish is produced. While we do not condone diverting fish from human consumption to the detriment of the local population, we also support the right for fishers to maximise the return for their catch within a legal framework and recognise the contribution a responsible farmed fish industry is making to human nutrition. Andrew Mallison Director General, The Marine Ingredients Organisation, London, UK • Tristram Stuart finds much to admire in Philip Lymbery's book Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat (21 February). Stuart contrasts Lymbery's book with the demands of Berlin's \"We are fed up!\" annual march. Stuart says he does not agree with the marchers' \"orthodoxy that large-scale farms and industrial agricultural technology are inherently wrong\". However, the march is far from being a monolithic block espousing a fixed set of ideas. Rather, it is a loose agglomeration of many different groups and aspirations. Among them vegetarian and vegan groups who are not just against intensive livestock farming but in favour of saying goodbye to any form of raising livestock. Karim Akerma Hamburg, Germany EU is a cause worth saving I find it saddening that some of the UK's political leaders, without any awareness of the contradictions involved, are proclaiming that the relationship between Scotland and England involves a long-standing relationship (21 February) but shy away from saying relationships between members of the European Union should be treated the same way. Those who pioneered the thinking necessary for the foundation of the EU had experienced the second world war and knew it was an issue of reforming international relationships. They spoke their \"Never again\" in the awareness that a previous generation, uttering the same words after the first world war, had failed to set up adequate structures that might have avoided another war. These men tried and failed to set up the EU and it was done by a later generation, who saw it primarily in terms of short-term economic and political self-interest – one of the reasons why there is still a lot of work to do to make it better. When \"divorce\" is on the cards, we must talk of commitment to a deeper reality than money and learn the relationship skills that can hold us together in bad times as well as good. Angela Robinson Southport, UK Swiss plan is far from perfect Before the Austrian far-right apes the Swiss (21 February), some things should be made clear. Many Swiss are surprised at the success of the initiative [to cap immigration into Switzerland] and are waking up to the harsh realities. Some cross-border research programmes have already been put on hold and the economic implications are beginning to dawn on them. Once the initiative is put into effect, employers who wish to engage foreign workers will first have to prove that they have tried to find a Swiss national for the position and have been unsuccessful. This will be time-consuming and costly. As for Christian Ragger, the ability to speak foreign languages does not prevent one being xenophobic. When speaking about immigration in Austria he says that although unemployment is high, the country is still taking in immigrants \"from Bulgaria and Romania, but also from Afghanistan and Syria\". Someone should explain the difference between immigrants and asylum seekers to him. Felicity Oliver Ostermundigen, Switzerland Genital mutilation must stop Your campaign against female genital mutilation (14 February) is laudable, and I hope that information about this terrible practice can be taught in schools and somehow subsequently reach the men of the schoolgirls' families, who are those who insist on it. Some years ago, the World Health Organisation deliberately changed the term describing the practice from \"female circumcision\" to \"female genital mutilation\", to show that the practice involved mutilation of the female genitalia and was not equivalent to male circumcision. Use of the abbreviation FGM removes the shock value of the word \"mutilation\". The same is true of use of the word \"cut\". These girls are mutilated, not simply cut. Language is our strongest weapon. It should not be weakened by the use of anodyne abbreviations and words. Your article was not, of course, meant to describe the full horrors of this practice, but your readers should know that the most extreme form of genital mutilation is the cause of many deaths, particularly during childbirth. Elisabeth Heseltine Saint Léon-sur-Vézère, France South Africa's political mix I must take exception to the comments in the article Black and white must create party to rival ANC (14 February). Unfortunately William Gumede gets his facts wrong when he says that \"The Democratic Alliance grew out of the old National party\". It is in fact the child of the old Progressive party whose illustrious members included Helen Suzman and Colin Eglin among others. They were certainly not \"tainted by their record under apartheid\". Nor was Alex Boraine, another Prog MP and the architect of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Unfortunately Gumede is correct in saying that the black electorate appears reluctant to vote for a party that is not perceived to be largely or totally black. As long as this attitude prevails the ANC will carry on getting away with their mismanagement of the country. More's the pity. Tim Gallwey Oloron-Sainte-Marie, France Briefly • A message for George Clooney and for the Italian government (Return Mona Lisa, actor Clooney says, 21 February). Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years in France as a paid guest of King Francis I; in fact, his presence was no longer wholly desirable in Italy. There are two theories: either that he brought the Mona Lisa to France from Italy or that he actually completed it in France. What is known is that it was sold for 4,000 écus (in gold) to the king in 1518. There is doubt as to whether the money was received by Da Vinci himself or by one of his disciples. There is no reason why this painting should go to Italy. Let Mr Clooney stick to his Nespresso! Alexandra Tavernier Marcq-en-Baroeul, France • It's amazing to learn that flood defences to protect Hinkley Point nuclear power station in England are not a priority (21 February). Hinkley sits on a peninsula where the river Parrett, overflowing with water draining from the flooded Somerset Levels, meets the already swollen Severn estuary. So these cuts create a recipe for a UK national disaster and mass evacuation that makes the recent floods look like very small beer indeed. No doubt the government and owners EDF would tell us that \"It'll never happen here\". But that's what they said at Fukushima too. David Gillam Cardigan, Wales • I was struck by Nicholas Stern's sincerity (The effects of climate change are here and now, 21 February). He is truly concerned about our children and grandchildren, who will have to deal with the catastrophic consequences of our selfishness and callousness after we die. We can avoid this ultimate horror if influential figures are inspired by the likes of Stern to make political capital out of presenting themselves as genuinely caring and courageous human beings.

The internet is playing an ever-increasing role in how we work, play and relate to each other. As a natural result of this, many of the most exciting new innovations that enable people to collaborate to address societal challenges are being developed online. At Nesta we call this activity digital social innovation (DSI) and it includes a diverse set of services, entrepreneurs and organisations. However, while DSI has been around since the birth of the web (and, in fact, fits the internet's original ethos of social good), there is little collected public knowledge on what best practice looks like, how networks of innovators might work together in order to understand its potential impact, and what policies might best help to encourage a greater use of the internet for social good. We are currently leading a large research project funded by the European Commission to explore how we can better understand the potential in DSI and support more of it to happen. So, with that in mind, here are 10 innovative people that are driving some of the most exciting digital social innovations: 1. Tomas Diez, co-founder, Smart Citizen kit @tomasdiez Tomas Diez is the co-founder of the Smart Citizen Kit project – an initiative that empowers citizens to improve urban life through capturing and analysing real-time environmental data. The Smart Citizen Kit is based on two components: the \"kit\" itself and the platform used to share data between people operating a kit. It is built on the open hardware product Arduino, and equipped with sensors that can measure air quality, temperature, sound and humidity. Via the platform anyone who owns a kit can share and visualise their data. 2. Massimo Banzi, co-founder, Arduino @mbanzi Massimo Banzi developed the Arduino, a simple, cheap circuit board with a microprocessor in 2005 to enable more people to build electronic contraptions. It has been described as \"LEGO for electronics\" because it is easy to use and can be a \"building block\" on which to make services and applications, which has helped social innovators develop low-cost tech solutions. More than 300,000 Arduino units have been sold worldwide to date. 3. Chris Lintott, director, Zooniverse @chrislintott Chris Lintott is founder of Zooniverse, a website that hosts online citizen science projects involving the public in crowdsourcing academic research. Often over-burdened academic departments don't have the time or the resources to process large datasets and some of the most important available information is in forms that computers still can't process. Zooniverse asks people (via large online communities) to devote their free time to projects such as analysing formations of galaxies and studying cancer cells. In the latter, Zooniverse got people analysing more than 2 million cancer images. 4. Sean Bonner, co-founder, Safecast @seanbonner Safecast – a project that enables citizens to capture and share measurement on radiation levels – was founded by Sean Bonner, Joi Ito and Pieter Franken in March 2011 as a response to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. Using open hardware the team built Geiger counters that were used to create large open datasets on radiation levels. All data is plotted on a map that visualises radiation levels in a given geographical area. To date, Safecast has captured more than 15 million data points. 5. Robert Bjarnason, co-founder, Your Priorities @CitizensFNDN In 2008 Robert Bjarnason and Gunnar Grimsson developed Your Priorities, a platform that enables groups of people to debate and prioritise policy ideas, budget decisions and micro-issues affecting their neighbourhood. The best ideas, with the most support, are elevated to the top and actioned on. In Reykjavik, Iceland, up to 40% of citizens use the platform and the city council has committed itself to discussing and implementing the most popular ideas on monthly basis. 6. Bas van Abel, founder, Fairphone @basvanabel Fairphone was founded by Bas van Abel in 2010. It started as a campaign against the conditions endured by people working in parts of the global electronics supply chain, including those in the mineral mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the assembly lines in China. Fairphone is a smartphone with a low environmental impact, using minerals from independent miners and manufacturers who guarantee basic standards to their employees. To ensure transparency Fairphone works with NGOs and its 50,000 Facebook followers on monitoring its supply chain. On 13 November 2013 Fairphone sold the first batch of 25,000 smartphones. 7. Olivier Schulbaum, co-founder, Goteo@goteofunding In 2011 Olivier Schulbaum, Enric Senabre and Susana Noguero founded Goteo.org – a network for crowdfunding and collaboration in Spain. Their idea was to help finance and support independent creative and innovative initiatives that contribute to the common good. In similar style to Kickstarter, Goteo helps facilitate the crowdfunding of projects. However, Goteo will only launch projects that contribute to free knowledge and the open source community. As a result, Goteo projects must use free and open licences, making them transferable and reusable by other people. As well as finance, projects can also source non-financial support from backers. Nodo Móvil, a mobile wifi connection unit for social movements, sourced developer support, a hacklab space for working, a 3D printer, and an offer to collaborate with local authorities on testing. 8. Juliana Rotich, co-founder, Ushahidi @afromusing \"Ushahidi\", which means \"testimony\" in Swahili, was founded by David Kobia, Juliana Rotich, Ory Okolloh and Erik Hersman, to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout in 2008. Since then Ushahidi has developed software that allows people to crowdsource and map crisis information from mobile phones or the internet. Applications built on the platform range from monitoring elections in India, to monitoring medical supply chains and co-ordinating disaster responses. After a devastating earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, the Ushahidi platform was used to report more than 40,000 incidents on locations of collapsed structures, damaged schools and fires. 9. Ramon Roca, founder, Guifi.net @guifinet Guifi.net was founded in 2000 as a response to the lack of broadband internet in rural Catalonia, where commercial internet providers weren't providing a connection. The idea, developed by Ramon Roca and his co-founders, was a \"mesh network\" where each person in the network used a small radio transmitter that functions like a wireless router to become a node in the Guifi net. Only one node needs to be connected to the internet and from it the connection is shared wirelessly with all others in its vicinity, who again share the connection wirelessly with those closest to them. With its more than 23,000 nodes, Guifi has been described as the largest mesh network in the world. The majority of Guifi activity is in Spain, but the network reaches as far as Argentina, China, India and the US. 10. Chris Taggart, founder, OpenCorporates @CountCulture OpenCorporates was founded in 2010 by Chris Taggart and Rob McKinnon to make information about companies and the corporate world more transparent and accessible. OpenCorporates does this by opening up data about corporations.The data is turned in to searchable maps and visualisations of complex corporate structures, often illustrating the layers of control across global organisations (in some cases showing thousands of subsidiaries). One analysis of the complex corporate structure of Goldman Sachs based on data from the US, New Zealand, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and the UK, identified 1,475 subsidiaries registered in the US and 739 in the Caymans alone. OpenCorporates has grown to become the largest open database of companies in the world, with data on 60m companies.

New York suffered a direct hit, with the city's mass transit system flooded and part-paralyzed for days to come. But there is good news, too, and that is all that it failed to do. Sandy did not kill hundreds – as Hurricane Katrina did in New Orleans in 2005 – thanks, in part, to timely evacuations and rescue efforts. And luckily, it did not trigger an even greater disaster at one of the region's nuclear power plants. But it could have. Watchdog groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) warn that America's nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to a variety of potential catastrophic events, both natural and resulting from deliberate sabotage or cyber-attack. And they say that federal regulations are currently inadequate to deal with all of these possible disaster scenarios. I reported on one such danger, solar flares, last May in the New York Daily News. A 2011 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory warns that a massive solar storm could knock out electricity in some areas for weeks, overwhelming the capacity of many nuclear plants to keep their critical cooling systems operational. But nuclear regulators have not required power plants to guard against the risk of solar storms. David Lochbaum, the director of UCS's nuclear safety project told me in an email interview that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses plants \"using the rearview mirror\". It looks to the past, in other words, to assess future risks. But, he says, past events are not always a good measure for the worst that can happen. Lochbaum cites Fukushima. The Daichi plant was located behind a seawall that was high enough to protect against the kind of flooding that Japan had seen previously. But nobody had considered the possibility that a monster tsunami could breach the wall. All 13 of the plant's back-up generators broke down an hour after the earthquake when they were swamped by the tsunami. As a result, that critical cooling system failed. \"Is it prudent public policy to operate facilities of such immense hazard on such tenuous assumptions?\" Lochbaum asks. He says that Hurricane Sandy provides further proof that we need to come up with solutions \"sooner rather than later\" to fix America's inadequate regulatory system. Lochbaum points out in a blog that the risks of nuclear power generation are magnified by the fact that the plants are always located near a river, lake or ocean. That is because producing nuclear power creates a lot of heat, which needs to be dissipated by huge volumes of water. These cooling systems are all that prevents the plutonium in reactor cores from going critical and melting down, much like what happened at Fukushima. But locating nuclear plants near bodies of water has its risks, which range from the clogging of intake pipes by barnacles and mussels – as happened at the Pilgrim nuclear plant near Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1981 – to potential damage from storm surges, such as those created by Hurricane Sandy. One facility was put in a state of \"high alert\" during Sandy due to high-water levels in its water intake structure. The Oyster Creek Generating Station on Barnegat Bay – 40 miles north of Atlantic City, and the oldest nuclear facility in the nation – was shut down last week for refueling. Plutonium, however, can dangerously overheat whether or not a plant is actively producing electricity. So, 300 employees stayed at Oyster Creek, Monday night, to ensure that the imperiled cooling system continued to function. Nuclear plants located near oceans are not the only ones threatened by flooding. Thirty-four reactors, fully a third of those in the US, are sited along rivers with dams upstream. A report released last March by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission suggests that many of these plants were not designed to withstand the massive floods that catastrophic dam collapse would unleash. The Huffington Post reported earlier this month that: \"According to the NRC's own calculations … the odds of the dam near the Oconee plant [operated by Duke Energy in South Carolina] failing at some point over the next 22 years are far higher than were the odds of an earthquake-induced tsunami causing a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.\" This alarming news, however, was blacked out of the NRC's public report. It was leaked by the lead author, Richard H Perkins, who said that his work had been censored because it revealed that: \"The NRC has been in possession of relevant, notable, and derogatory safety information for an extended period but failed to properly act on it.\" In another section of the report, about the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant in Nebraska, NRC redactors removed information indicating that the failure of the Oahe or Fort Randall dams could result in levels of rampaging water higher than the plant's flood protection walls. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission evidently believes that it is better to hide the facts about nuclear risks than to fix the problem. Critics allege that not only does the NRC withhold critical information, but also fails in many cases to enforce regulations that are already on the books. David Lochbaum warns: \"I'm most concerned about the NRC's practice of allowing unsafe reactors to operate. UCS's Nuclear Power Information Tracker shows 47 reactors that NRC knows to violate fire protection regulations and 27 reactors with seismic protection known to be less than the seismic hazards they face. These pre-existing vulnerabilities mean that the American public is protected more by luck than by skill.\" And if superstorm Sandy, and the increasing frequency of other extreme weather events in recent years is any evidence, America's luck may be running out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/06/nuclear-power-leukaemia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-06T15:08:00Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power plants cleared of causing leukaemia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/06/nuclear-power-leukaemia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/06/nuclear-power-leukaemia","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power plants cleared of causing leukaemia","bodyText":"Nuclear power plants have been cleared of causing childhood cancers by experts from the UK government's advisory committee, which says experts should now be looking for other reasons – perhaps infections or even viruses – to explain leukaemia clusters in their vicinity. The 14th report (pdf) from the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (COMARE), re-reviewed all childhood leukaemia cases reported around 13 nuclear power plants in the UK. The request came from the Department of Health and devolved authorities last year in response to the UK's decision to build the most ambitious new fleet of nuclear reactors in Europe. Not only did the committee find no increase in cases linked to emissions, but it also found similar numbers of leukaemia cases in proximity to sites that had been considered for nuclear power plants, but where building did not take place. There were 20 cases of leukaemia in a child under five within a five-kilometre radius of one of the 13 power plants and 430 cases within 25km. There were 26 cases within 5km of one of the seven potential sites and 492 within 25km. Prof Alex Elliott, chair of COMARE, said it was time to look elsewhere for causes. \"We should be keeping a watching brief but we think we should be looking at other places,\" he said. There are other theories about the possible causes of cancer near power plants. \"We know that leukaemia is related directly to socio-economic class – the higher the class, the higher the rate. People in nuclear power stations tend to be of higher economic class,\" said Elliott. Childhood leukaemia is also less likely in over-populated areas, whereas power stations are more likely to be situated away from population centres. Among the other possible explanations are the infection hypothesis of Leo Kinlan, which suggests that the cancers are triggered by the arrival of a group of people to work in the plant and their families carrying microorganisms from other parts of the country. A study about to be published into a childhood cancer cluster in Fallon, Nevada, suggests a virus transmitted by mosquitos could be the cause. The area, which houses a US naval base involving a lot of population movement, had an unusually high incidence of childhood leukaemia between 1997 and 2003. The cases were predominantly diagnosed in the summer and most of the young children lived in agricultural, not urban, areas. There are two identified clusters near nuclear installations, but both, Dounreay and Sellafield, are reprocessing plants, not power plants. COMARE's next report will review the latest evidence for childhood leukemias near them. The latest report also did not look at cancer clusters near the Calder Hall power station, because of its proximity to the Sellafield reprocessing plant. The COMARE report will be a blow to the Heysham Anti-Nuclear Alliance, which in March launched a legally aided action against the government's nuclear expansion programme. Their case centres on a German study, which COMARE was specifically asked to review. The Kinderkrebs in der Umgebung von Kernkraftwerken (KIIK) study found a link between leukemia clusters and German power plants. But COMARE says KIIK was heavily influenced by cancer cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1990 and did not take fully into account later years when the risk was lower. KIIK was a case control study, not a geographical study of the sort COMARE undertakes, said Elliott."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/aug/21/leap-fukushima-danger-ranking","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-21T06:50:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima warning: danger level at nuclear plant jumps to 'serious'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/21/leap-fukushima-danger-ranking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/aug/21/leap-fukushima-danger-ranking","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima warning: danger level at nuclear plant jumps to 'serious'","bodyText":"Japan is to issue its gravest warning about the state of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant since the facility suffered a triple meltdown almost two and a half years ago. The new warning, expected on Wednesday, comes only a day after the nuclear watchdog assigned a much lower ranking when the plant's operator, Tepco, admitted about 300 tonnes of highly toxic water had leaked from a storage tank at the site. The Nuclear Regulation Authority has now said it will dramatically raise the incident's severity level from one to three on the eight-point scale used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for radiation releases. Each single-digit increase in the scale actually represents a tenfold increase in the severity of a radiological release, according to the IAEA. The NRA on Tuesday classified the leakage only as an \"anomaly\" on the IAEA scale but now considers it a \"serious incident\". The leak is the single most dangerous failure at the plant since the 2011 meltdown, which warranted the maximum level of seven on the severity scale, putting it on a par with the Chernobyl disaster 25 years earlier. \"Judging from the amount and the density of the radiation in the contaminated water that leaked ... a level three assessment is appropriate\", the NRA said in a document posted on its website on Wednesday. Tepco has admitted it has yet to identify the cause of the leak, in which highly radioactive water appears to have breached a steel storage tank and seeped into the ground. The leak from the tank, which can hold up to 1,000 tonnes of water, has yet to be stemmed, according to Japanese media reports. The incident is separate from additional water leaks of up to 300 tonnes a day recently reported by Tepco. Those spillages involve groundwater that is leaking into the nearby Pacific ocean. Tepco said there was no evidence that water from the storage tank had found its way into the sea. The utility said radioactive matter, including caesium and strontium, had seeped into soil, which may have to be dug up and removed. Puddles near the faulty tank are so contaminated that a person standing 50 centimetres away would in one hour receive five times the annual dose limit for Japanese nuclear workers. Initial readings showed that radiation levels in one puddle were 100 millisieverts an hour. The leak underlined the risks being taken by workers at the site; after 10 hours anyone in proximity to the contaminated water would develop radiation sickness, with symptoms including nausea and a drop in white blood cells. The new warning is the most serious since the plant was struck by a powerful tsunami on 11 March 2011. The wave, triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off Japan's north-east coast, wrecked the plant's back-up power supply and sent three of its six reactors into meltdown. Tepco is using huge quantities of water to cool melted fuel rods lying deep inside the wrecked reactors, but has failed to prevent contaminated water leaking into the ground and the sea. Contaminated water is stored in about 1,000 tanks that have been built about 500 yards from the shoreline. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, recently indicated he had lost confidence in Tepco's ability to deal with the water crisis. Abe, a supporter of nuclear energy, said the government would intervene to help the utility stem the leaks and begin the long and costly process of decommissioning the plant. The new leaks have fuelled public anger over Tepco's handling of contaminated water and caused concern overseas. Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second-biggest carrier, said it would cancel four chartered flights between Seoul and Fukushima in October out of concern over radiation leaks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/05/poland-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T15:54:00Z","webTitle":"Poland determined to build nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/poland-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/05/poland-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"Poland determined to build nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Poland is determined to push on with plans to build its first generation of nuclear power stations over the next decade despite the Japanese reactor crisis sparking a global reassessment of the controversial energy source. In an interview, Treasury minister Aleksander Grad told the Guardian: \"Of course it's time to review and analyse [safety] carefully but it wouldn't be right to make a rash decision, a 180 degree turn.\" \"Poland is not at risk of earthquakes and tsunamis. The problem in Japan was not the power plants themselves, but the earthquake. We need to make a decision based on rational analysis and not emotions.\" The nuclear disaster in Fukushima has sparked public debates about the future of nuclear power around the world and Germany temporarily shut down seven of its oldest reactors pending a safety review. Grad said the centre-right government wants Poland's first two nuclear reactors to produce a tenth of the country's energy. Most of it comes from coal and gas, as well as renewables such as wind farms. Poland is in the middle of privatising some of its biggest energy companies, as part of a privatisation spree that started 20 years ago and transformed Poland's socialist state to a market economy. Many banks were privatised in the 1990s, and the Polish telecoms group TPSA was sold to France Telecom in 2000. More than 800 companies were put on the privatisation list in 2008 and so far 440 have been privatised. The list includes large companies such as the airline Lot which could be sold by the end of the year, as well as hundreds of smaller firms. The Treasury minister, who is in charge of the sell-offs, said: \"The scope of the privatisation programme is unprecedented in the whole region of central and eastern Europe. We carried on throughout the crisis even though some projects were put on hold.\" However, the government has run into some problems recently. Last Friday it abandoned plans to sell a 51% stake in Enea, Poland's third-largest energy group, after bidders, which included France's EDF, did not meet its requirements. Price was not an issue, said Grad, but pointed to the government's condition not to break up the company and corporate governance requirements. \"When the time is right, we will relaunch the process,\" he said. Poland aims to raise some 15bn zloty (£3.25bn) from sell-offs of state assets this year. It needs the privatisation proceeds to cut its budget deficit, which amounts to nearly 8% of GDP. The government of prime minister Donald Tusk has also reined in public spending but ruled out tax hikes, which would be embarrassing given his 2007 election promise to lower taxes. Some 20 companies, mainly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, will remain in state ownership, including PGE, Poland's bigger power group, which will build its nuclear reactors. Grad expressed some impatience with the speed of the privatisation programme, after a slowdown under the two previous Polish governments. \"After 20 years of transformation we should have this process behind us,\" he said. \"When I look at the small and medium-sized businesses, these are sectors the Treasury should have exited many years ago. Not every government sees this as a priority. There was a period when the process stalled, but the past three years have been quite successful.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2013/may/31/burning-question-berners-lee-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-31T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Burning Question by Mike Berners-Lee and Duncan Clark – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/31/burning-question-berners-lee-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2013/may/31/burning-question-berners-lee-review","fields":{"headline":"The Burning Question by Mike Berners-Lee and Duncan Clark – review","bodyText":"Humankind cannot bear very much reality but climate change will not go away: 400 parts-per-million, Prince Charles on the warpath, and here is the most succinct exposition of the great dilemma for some time. Mike Berners-Lee and Duncan Clark are honest about our reluctance to face up to the challenge: \"If you wanted to invent a problem to induce confusion, disbelief and the turning of blind eyes, it would be hard to come up with something better than climate change.\" It is this cussed nature of the climate-change conundrum that has led, in the last three and a half years since the failed Copenhagen climate summit, to the triumph of the rightwing lobbies over the scientists, environmentalists and concerned citizens. Effective political action to mitigate climate change has ceased and, as Berners-Lee and Clark point out, carbon dioxide emissions are building up at an exponential rate (compound interest, in the vernacular). Beyond its raw facts about emissions, this book's great contribution to the debate is to point out that the markets are gambling trillions of dollars on a bet that governments will never seriously curb carbon emissions. How do they know this? Because to address climate change would mean leaving most of the remaining fossil carbon in the earth. But that would entail the future value of the fossil-fuel energy companies falling to a fraction of their present valuation: current share prices declare that no climate mitigation will happen. However, sudden action may be forced on governments by a period of catastrophic climate damage and food shortages. This would cause a global collapse of the energy industry greater than the crash of 2007-08. Something will have to give. If the markets are playing their usual game – we know a bubble will burst but that's OK because we'll get out in time – they are gambling with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and the livelihoods of billions. The second vital contribution to the argument is the revelation that so far the switch to renewables has had no effect on global carbon emissions, which are increasing by about 3% a year. New technologies have often not supplanted the old but simply added to the mix: the appetite of the world's population for burning energy, including carbon energy, is insatiable. Berners-Lee and Clark (and also Bill McKibben in a lucid foreword) explain the maths with stark clarity. Because carbon stays in the atmosphere for a long time what matters now is the total we can safely burn. To come within the agreed 2C rise we can add around 565 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050. But using established reserves of fossil fuels would add 2,795 gigatonnes and the City is betting on all of that being burned. At the present rate we'll hit 565 gigatonnes in a mere 16 years. After which, if we are serious, we will have to stop emitting carbon altogether. Obviously, this is not going to happen, but what is? If nothing is done, there is expected to be a 4-6C rise in average global temperature, wreaking havoc. The Burning Question is eloquent on the trade-offs between economics and ecology, and especially wise on the psychology that has most of the world paralysed. The authors quote JK Galbraith: \"Faced with the choice of changing one's mind and with proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.\" When of course what everyone should be busy on are the solutions to the problem. As Prof David McKay, chief scientific adviser at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, has said: \"You need almost everything and you need it very fast – right now.\" Berners-Lee and Clark almost endorse nuclear power (why is the French example of decarbonising 80% of their electricity generation by means of nuclear power in the 1980s accorded so little attention and respect?) and they have sensible ideas about agriculture and deforestation, neglected but important sources of carbon dioxide. Above all, they advocate carbon capture and storage, which, as they say, is a way of making the oil, gas and coal industries \"part of the solution\" by exploiting their vast knowledge of piping large quantities of stuff around the world. Carbon capture is not merely a way of snatching the carbon dioxide from the air and burying it. It could be a major source of the fuel we need. By focusing on clean energy sources such as solar, wind and wave power, it is sometimes assumed that carbon-free electricity is the whole solution. But planes are never going to run on electricity; nor are heavy agricultural and mining equipment ever likely to; and biomass is needed as feedstock on a huge scale for the chemicals industry, especially bulk plastics. All our biomass, whether fresh-grown or fossil, comes from one process: natural photosynthesis whereby complex organics are created by splitting water and carbon dioxide using sunlight. The mechanism of this fabulously complex feat of photochemistry is gradually being unravelled. The holy grail is to replicate this industrially and economically to bypass natural photosynthesis, leaving that for food production. Surely, this process, which is already feasible on a pilot scale, warrants an international moonshot or Human Genome Project approach? Momentum is building to consider global artificial photosynthesis as \"the moral culmination of nanotechnology\". Meanwhile, we have the fossil-fuel lobby: a modern version of the Catholic church refusing to admit the evidence of Galileo's telescope. The church apologised 367 years later. The lobbyists for the dirty black stuff are just as wrong and will be proved to be so. But any (at present, most unlikely) apology from them is going to be too late for us all. There have been many books on this issue but The Burning Question lives up to the urgency of its title. Clearly set out, steely with the numbers but fair and humane in its assessments of human strengths and weaknesses, it is a book to reignite the debate. • Peter Forbes's Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage is published by Yale"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/oct/16/citizens-science-greener-china","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-16T10:49:53Z","webTitle":"Citizens and science in a greener China | Adrian Ely and David Tyfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/oct/16/citizens-science-greener-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/oct/16/citizens-science-greener-china","fields":{"headline":"Citizens and science in a greener China","bodyText":"This week's visit to Beijing by George Osborne and David Willetts is important. Sensible collaboration with China in science, technology and innovation is not only in Britain's economic interests but can also help to address environmental challenges shared by the entire international community. Doing this effectively requires an appreciation of innovation policies and processes in both countries. One interesting strand of this is the different role that citizen participation plays in Chinese and UK innovation policy. The past few years have seen a raft of science and innovation partnerships springing up between China and the UK, including in the areas of low-carbon technologies – a UK priority for collaboration ever since China topped the world table of CO2-emitters in 2007. Green and low carbon technologies, however, come in many varieties – each requiring different forms of government support or citizen action. For China as for Britain, low carbon innovation raises significant political challenges, not just technological ones. As such, effective collaboration requires both sides to grapple with these political dimensions of decision making. Both countries face distinct challenges in constructing what Mariana Mazzucato describes as an \"entrepreneurial state\". China's innovation system is shaped primarily by government intervention, whereas in the UK such policies have – until recently – been associated with clumsy attempts at \"picking winners\". As a result of targeted policies and investment, the growth of low-carbon technologies in China has been spectacular. To reach the goal in China's 12th Five Year Plan of 100 gigawatts of installed wind capacity by 2015, and 1000 gigawatts by 2050 (roughly equivalent to the current capacity of the entire US grid), the government has invested heavily in R&amp;D, used aggressive local regulations to demand the involvement of Chinese suppliers, and provided strong support for partially state-owned firms like GoldWind. Such intense state involvement is not by itself sufficient to bring about the system-wide changes necessary for the shift to a low-carbon economy. The issue for China (as for other countries) is the more political one of constructing an inclusive and responsive innovation culture, which aligns technological developments with social and organisational change in firms and communities. China's approach may seem to be a strength, rather than a weakness, on this score. While efforts to expand onshore wind power in the UK are often hampered by nimbyism, Chinese civil society has largely remained silent about wind power, allowing a massive rollout to proceed. However, other technological efforts to reach the country's official objective of reducing carbon intensity of production by 17% have met with more resistance. Indeed, while support for explicitly political agendas of democratic reform remains subdued, ostensibly non-political issues of science, innovation and the environment are the focus of increasingly visible public attention. For instance, the Chinese government is fully committed to promoting nuclear power as part of its low-carbon energy mix. Yet plans for the Longwan Industrial Park project in south-east China, which would have included a uranium processing facility, were recently called off by the authorities in response to public protest. Agri-science or agricultural biotechnology – central to the Chinese government's food security strategy (and also one of David Willetts's \"Eight great technologies\") – is another area where China's strong state has met with resistance. Although GM cotton has been found to have environmental benefits in China, the public are not fully persuaded, and fierce debate in China's burgeoning social media has contributed to delays in the cultivation of GM rice and maize, despite formal approval from China's Ministry of Agriculture back in 2009. Debates around nuclear energy and GM crops are illustrative of a wider shift towards citizen influences on policy-making, especially in the environmental arena. A recent book, China and the Environment: The Green Revolution, edited by Sam Geall, describes some of the citizen-led initiatives and journalistic efforts that are slowly and informally democratising moves towards a more sustainable model of development. A priority now for Chinese policymakers is to find ways of accommodating and harnessing these uninvited forms of public engagement. The UK has experienced similar controversies over the years, and still struggles with how to govern the introduction of risky but potentially transformative technologies. However, policymakers in the UK have at least begun to experiment with mechanisms through which citizen perspectives can be taken into account. Various forms of public consultation now play an important, if still imperfect, role in decision making. China and the UK could share insights from their respective experiences of promoting more entrepreneurial states. China could teach the UK a thing or two about the rapid deployment of low-carbon technologies. And the UK could perhaps help China's leadership to engage more constructively with the social debates and uncertainties generated by new technologies. Building public confidence in innovation is a challenge for both nations. As the UK and China work more closely together, they need to build conversational, as well as entrepreneurial, states.

But in its preliminary estimate [pdf] released on Wednesday, the WHO said infants in one town near the plant could be at a greater risk of developing thyroid cancer after exposure to radioactive iodine-131. The study is the first by a UN agency since the Fukushima plant was hit by a 14-metre (46ft) tsunami following a magnitude-9.0 earthquake on 11 March last year. The wave knocked out the facility's back-up power supply, causing three of its six reactors to suffer meltdown. The independent experts who compiled the report said that people in the towns of Namie, located inside the 12-mile nuclear evacuation zone, and Iitate, which lies 25 miles north-west of Fukushima Daiichi, may have received the highest doses, of between 10 millisieverts a year and 50mSv in the wake of the accident. Infants in Namie were thought to have received thyroid radiation doses of between 100 and 200mSv a year. \"That would be one area because of the estimated high dose that we would have to keep an eye on,\" WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told Reuters. \"Below 100mSv, the studies have not been conclusive.\" Radioactive iodine-131 accumulates in the thyroid gland, and children are known to be particularly at risk of developing cancer. In a separate interim report, the UN's scientific committee on the effects of radiation (Unscear) said that none of the deaths of six plant workers since last March was related to radiation. It added that several workers had been \"irradiated after contamination of their skin\", but that no clinically observable health effects had been reported. A Unscear spokesman in Vienna said the six workers' deaths had been caused by accidents and health problems that preceded their time at the plant. They included a man in his 40s who died from acute leukaemia, and another who fell from a ladder. Two men are thought to have drowned in the basement of a reactor turbine building when the tsunami struck the plant. While little is known about the possible health effects of long-term exposure to radiation below 100mSv a year, UN experts say people exposed to higher levels are at a slightly greater risk of developing cancer. The threshold for acute radiation syndrome is about 1Sv (1000mSv). Japan's government hopes to keep public exposure from the accident below 20mSv a year, but eventually wants to bring levels in areas contaminated by the accident to 1mSv a year or below. Natural background radiation around the world is about 2.4mSv a year. The 124-page WHO report, compiled using data provided by Japanese authorities, found that doses in other parts of Fukushima prefecture were within the typical 1-10mSv range, while those in the rest of Japan stood at just 0.1-1 mSv. Despite fears in other countries that they have been exposed to dangerous radiation leaks, the report said levels were below 0.01mSv – or about half the dose received during a chest X-ray – in other parts of the world, including in neighbouring South Korea. The experts based their assessments on data on the amount of radioactivity in the air, soil, water and food supplies after the disaster. \"In these most affected locations, external exposure is the major contributor to the effective dose,\" the WHO said. The experts conceded they had made assumptions based on limited information – including the composition and dispersion of radioactive clouds – but insisted that every effort had been made \"to avoid any underestimation of doses\". The WHO report said that the lifetime dose in Fukushima was expected to be lower than that among people exposed after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. \"The experience of the Chernobyl accident was that about 30% of the lifetime dose was delivered during the first year and about 70% during the first 15 years,\" it said. \"On the basis of environmental activity concentration data, it can be expected that the fraction of the lifetime dose beyond the first year will be lower for the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident than for the Chernobyl accident.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/27/us-iran-nuclear-deal-discussion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-26T23:54:12Z","webTitle":"Breakthrough hailed as US and Iran sit down for nuclear deal discussion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/us-iran-nuclear-deal-discussion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/27/us-iran-nuclear-deal-discussion","fields":{"headline":"Breakthrough hailed as US and Iran sit down for nuclear deal discussion","bodyText":"Iran and the US held their first substantive high-level meeting since the 1979 Islamic revolution on Thursday night at multilateral talks hailed on both sides as a fresh start for nuclear negotiations, raising hopes of a solution to the long running stalemate. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, sat next to each other at the seven-nation meeting at the UN headquarters, and lingered afterwards for a bilateral discussion of more than 20 minutes, a breakthrough in a relationship that has been frozen for more than three decades. The meeting was chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who said that the parties would meet again in Geneva on 15 October for a two-day meeting aimed at achieving the first real diplomatic progress for several years. Zarif and Kerry said it was possible that the two of them would attend the Geneva meeting. Ashton said she and Zarif both wanted a deal concluded in an ambitious timeframe and said an agreement could be implemented within a year. \"The discussions were very substantive, businesslike,\" Zarif said, adding he hoped a solution could be found in a timely fashion. Kerry noted a change in tone from Iran saying Zarif was \"very different in the vision that he held out with respect to the possibilities for the future. I have just met with him now in a side meeting in which we took a moment to explore a little further the possibilities of how to proceed based on what President Obama laid out in his speech to the general assembly earlier this week,\" Kerry said. \"And we've agreed to try to continue the process that will make concrete and find a way to answer the questions that people have about Iran's nuclear program.\" The secretary of state suggested Zarif had put some new ideas forward, saying: \"I think all of us were pleased that the foreign minister came today, that he did put some possibilities on the table. Now it's up to people to do the hard work of trying to fill out what those possibilities will do.\" Ashton said: \"It was a substantial meeting with a good atmosphere, and energetic. We had a discussion on how we would go forward with an ambitious timeframe to see if we can move along quickly … The good news is there are talks about a timetable.\" The meeting was also attended by foreign ministers from the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, also welcomed what he described as a new Iranian approach to the talks. \"I think the tone and spirit of the meeting we've had has been very good and indeed a big improvement on the tone and spirit of previous meetings on this issue and I pay tribute to Minister Zarif for that and for taking the approach that he has so far,\" Hague said. Ashton noted that the six-nation negotiating group that she convenes had previously offered a confidence-building package involving some sanctions relief in return for Iran accepting limits on its uranium enrichment, and getting rid of its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, which is the main proliferation concern. Western diplomats have said a more comprehensive deal could be done, in which Iran agrees only to produce low-enriched uranium for use in nuclear power stations and accepts more stringent scrutiny from weapons inspectors, and, in return, the West lifts the bulk of its sanctions and recognises Iran's right to enrich. Iranian officials have hinted that such a deal might be possible. Ashton said she was keen to hear any proposals Tehran might have before the Geneva meeting, asking that they be provided early so they could be studied. In his remarks after Thursday night's meeting, Zarif hinted that a trade-off was possible, but was vague on its outlines. \"We hope to be able to make progress towards resolving this issue in a timely fashion based on respecting the rights of the Iranian people to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, at the same time making sure that there is no concern on the international level that Iran's nuclear programme is anything but peaceful,\" he said. How far Iran is prepared to go in removing international concern could determine whether the talks succeed or fail. Western diplomats said that more transparency alone would not be enough; Tehran would have to accept the principle of limits on its uranium enrichment. That may become clearer in Geneva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/24/nuclear-power-not-only-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-24T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"Letters: Nuclear is not the only option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/24/nuclear-power-not-only-option","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/24/nuclear-power-not-only-option","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is not the only option","bodyText":"I agree with Simon Jenkins that \"British energy policy is a dark underworld of fanatics\" (Comment, 23 May) and I can't understand why the government is pushing for more investment in nuclear power when Fukushima is so recent. I've also heard Ed Davey \"squirming\" on the BBC and saying we need investment to \"keep the lights on\". Keep the lights on? Maybe 50 years ago this was the primary use of electricity but now most goes on powering masses of superfluous appliances and gadgets. So we should ask ourselves how we might distinguish between essential (keeping the lights on) and luxury (frothing coffee) electricity? One way would be to install a supplementary DC circuit in every home. Here batteries would be charged at cheap night-time rates or from solar panels, with them supplying a limited amount of essential electricity. The cost for daytime AC power could then be increased significantly so we all start to feel a real level of \"financial pain\" when we run the tumble-drier, switch on air-conditioning or leave the TV running when we are not really watching it. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany • It ill behoves those of us who have lived long lives of profligate energy consumption to wring our hands as if nothing can be done to rationalise UK energy policy. 0ur best efforts make little impression on the global problem and may not impress India or China, but to do nothing sends a message about the greed of arrogant developed nations which they and others will seize with both hands. And we don't need to wait for Jenkins's wise mathematician to deliver answers. We should begin now by taking aggressive measures to cut energy use; not a glamorous step but effective, and cost-effective too. Phil Booth Bristol • Simon Jenkins is right that energy policy can be confusing. Technologies hailed as the sustainable solutions to all of our energy problems often prove nothing of the sort. But his view of biomass as either a new dawn for energy or a technology that threatens half the world's forests is no longer true. The biomass power plant we have developed at Aston University overcomes many hurdles that have held back this technology. By using residues and waste instead of energy crops, the plant does not require the destruction of rainforests or agricultural land for palm oil production. In fact, its by-product – biochar – can be used to increase crop yields. And by using heat instead of incineration, it produces no emissions. In short, there are no downsides. The first industrial-scale plant is working. If the government wants a clear conclusion for its energy policy, it need look no further. Tim Miller Project manager, European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University • No public subsidy for nuclear power, says the energy secretary. Subsidies to the nuclear industry are illegal, according to EU regulations. So the government seeks to create a market structure which ensures the lights stay on. Consumers will have to pay for the infrastructure for new nuclear power stations, meaning prices will rise (Energy market shakeup raises fears of higher bills, 23 May). The insurance industry has become more reluctant to insure nuclear power stations after Fukushima, meaning we, the consumers, would have to pick up any bill in case of an accident. The issue of storing used nuclear material has also not been settled. Will the nuclear industry pay for a depository deep underground, and for safe transport of the material? The used fuel rods are likely to remain at Sellafield, and will need guarding from terrorists and rising sea levels for centuries to come. Again, the government, ie we, will have to foot the bill. That is not called a subsidy, but it amounts to one by any other name. Legal wrangling will also cause super delays. Why does nobody mention the building of the high-voltage, direct current European supergrid, which will allow import of electricity from the Sahara, hydro-power from Norway, and geothermal from Iceland at times when we cannot generate solar or wind power, and export electricity when we generate more than we need? Several undersea links are there: to France and Ireland. Last year a cable was laid to the Netherlands. The next link to Norway has already been planned. Why does the energy secretary not mention this project, which won't expose us to the risk of a nuclear future? Aart and Wiebina Heesterman Birmingham • Is this a Simon Jenkins first? \"Do not read on if you want a conclusion on this subject\" says Simon to introduce his second paragraph. As he is never normally under-opinionated, perhaps he is starting to realise, as the government already has, that there is no easy answer to Britain's energy future. Governments for years have read all the reports about the deleterious effects of burning fossil fuels and the future cost of the almost certainly increasing reliance on importing them, and tried to nudge energy policy towards other options, but immediately bang up against voters who are against whatever else is offered – nuclear (safety and cost), and renewables (cost and impacts on what I would call amenity and ambience rather than environment). The only logical response to my mind is to charge the cost to the taxpayer and ignore the amenity, but recent governments, especially this one, won't increase taxes for that, and are also terrified of campaigns against large-scale and/or highly visible options, as they are mostly in or proposed for Conservative areas. A further consideration that Jenkins does not mention is that renewables would immediately become more attractive if a way could be found to store the intermittent power generated from solar and wind, to keep the grid going at night and between weather depressions. I've not heard of any work being done in this regard. Anyway, come on Simon, give us a clue, how would you navigate through the \"dark underworld\" as you put it? David Mills York • Simon Jenkins is looking for mathematical formulae that will help him understand the complexities of climate change, renewables and nuclear. Let me oblige with three suggestions from a recent conference on climate change organised by Help Rescue the Planet. First RC + MJ = GG where RC stands for Reduced Carbon, MJ for More Jobs and GG for Green Growth. Secondly, EC + R &gt; NO where EC stands for Energy Conservation, R for Renewables and NO for Nuclear Option (In maths &gt; indicates greater than). In other words if the government is planning to spend £100bn to meet our energy requirements, should it spend it on conservation and renewables or on getting Russia or China to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. In political as well as purely economic terms this is a \"no brainer\". The third formula was devised by our conference organiser and is the Russell-Jones variant of Einstein's famous 1905 formula MC2 = E where M stands for multitude (as in world population), C = carbon per capita (ie emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases per head of population per year) and E stands for extinction of species or, for those politicians who calculate that plants and animals don't vote, it stands for the END of human civilisation as we know it.

Despite George Monbiot's perverse conclusion (Why Fukushima made me stop worrying about nuclear power and love it, 22 March), the disaster at Fukushima has so far caused the evacuation of over 100,000 people, the suspension of fisheries and agriculture over a large area and a ban on the consumption of drinking water by babies in a city of 12 million. The reactors are not yet under control, four out of six of them are so badly damaged that they can never be used again and the whole site will probably have to be abandoned and cordoned off for decades, at astronomic expense. Nuclear power is also more accident-prone, because fission reactors are so hard to control and the complexity of the containment structures and control systems makes them highly susceptible to design, construction and operator error. The worst aspect, however, is that nuclear power generates waste and decommissioning products, which cannot be safely disposed of, are a major security threat and must be guarded, monitored and cooled for decades. Every time we commission a nuclear power plant we are taking out a massive mortgage that future generations will have to pay for. Yet we cannot know that they will have the will, the capacity, the skills and the resources to do so. Mike Gatehouse Brecon, Powys • Monbiot's assumption ignores all that is known about the health effects of previous nuclear accidents, particularly Chernobyl. Leaving aside the deaths of workers killed either by the initial explosion or through exposure to dangerous levels of radiation during the clean-up, the impact on health from nuclear accidents continues – 25 years and more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer later, the effects of Chernobyl are still being felt in the UK. Today, more than 300 farms remain contaminated and are still under food restriction orders. Supporters of nuclear power often fail to address the threat to the health of future generations by the unsolved problem of nuclear waste. Buried in the ground, it remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years, and is vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. What right do we have to dump this lethal legacy on future generations? Monbiot worries about the impact of wind farms, pylons, power lines and reservoirs on the landscape. Can we really balance the altered appearance of the landscape with the impact that drinking water contaminated by radiation would have on children's health? Given the potentially devastating impact on the health of future generations, the cost of nuclear power is just too high. Marion Birch Director, Medact • I agree with George Monbiot's support of nuclear power but was surprised he did not quote James Hansen of Nasa in his book Storms of My Grandchildren: \"Fast (modern) reactors produce nuclear waste but in volumes much less than slow reactors. More important, radioactivity becomes inconsequential in a few hundred years rather than ten thousand\" and \"we already have enough fuel stockpiled in nuclear waste and byproducts of nuclear weapons to supply all our fuel needs for about a thousand years\". Surely the answer to nuclear waste is to reprocess it. Carbon capture of coal generators produces liquid CO2 that is stored in oil seams and can leak. Surely burning coal with carbon capture is more dangerous, and the waste more toxic and longer lasting, than fourth generation nuclear reactors. Nuclear supporting conservation and the development of renewables, including tidal barrages such as Severn, Solway and Islay, are safer and the answer to our energy needs. John Smith Walton, Cumbria • To those like George Monbiot who state \"there is no alternative\" to the great God atom, I always say you could consider how it is that Germany has the confidence to go down an entirely non-nuclear route, even with the same 2050 objective of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases. The difference between where we believe our electricity consumption will be by then – twice, even three times, present levels – and where the German government thinks electricity demand can be via a purposeful and consistent efficiency programme (25% below present levels) is so vast that it does beg one obvious question. And that is, naturally, why have the Germans got it all so economically wrong yet again? Andrew Warren Director, Association for the Conservation of Energy • Monbiot's concern about global warming is sincere, so perhaps his nuclear affair should end. A landmark study published recently in Scientific American found: \"Nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction and uranium-refining and transport are considered.\" Atomic energy is no friend of climate. Gideon Forman Executive director, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment • George Monbiot blithely cites a graphic from xkcd.com which claims that 100 mSv is the lowest one-year dose clearly linked to increased cancer risk. This is just not true. For example, Steve Wing and David Richardson (Radiation and Mortality of Workers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1999) found significant increased cancer risks associated with exposure to 10 mSv in workers at the Oak Ridge plant in Tennessee. Japanese A-bomb survivors' cancer risks are also linked to their radiation dose, even for those who received less than 20 mSv in 1945. Monbiot's polemic does not fit all the facts. Greg Dropkin Liverpool • I have every sympathy with George Monbiot, and his wish to abandon fossil fuels, but embracing nuclear power may not be the best solution. He claims that only 43 people died as a result of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. In fact, in 2006, the BEIR VII committee of the US National Academy of Science estimated that Chernobyl was responsible for an extra 4,000 cancer deaths among evacuees and workers involved in the clean-up, and 5,000 extra cancer deaths among the population of Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation. Furthermore, if one accepts the linear no-threshold model of ionising radiation, then, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) , there will be a total of 16,000 excess cancer deaths worldwide as a result of this nuclear disaster. Of course, these figures are dwarfed by the likely deaths resulting from climate change which will threaten millions through drought, famine and disease. So the current paradigm for the world community is to continue burning fossil fuels with the certainty of widespread environmental destruction, or to rely on nuclear power and risk the possibility of widespread radioactive contamination. Personally, I cannot think of a stronger argument in favour of renewable energy. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • The assumption implicit in Monbiot's essay is that the human population can continue to grow and consume more energy without limit. But just as there is \"peak oil\" there is \"peak uranium\" also. The entry on this subject in Wikipedia offers a good introduction to the topic. Some analysts estimate that we have already passed the point of maximum uranium production; while others leave about 25 years. If we put all our efforts into a massive transformation from fossil fuel to nuclear energy, as Monbiot advocated, what does he propose after the point of peak uranium? During his shortlived nuclear renaissance, the human population will continue to grow; and be that much more vulnerable when peak uranium compels another transformation to a truly sustainable lifestyle. I would prefer Monbiot to put his mind to estimating the size of the human population that is sustainable on Spaceship Earth in perpetuity; and how to make the earliest possible transition to that size. Derek Wilson Port Moody, Canada • Caroline Lucas and George Monbiot have missed the elephant in the room in their head-to-head (Is nuclear power still the answer to our energy problems, 26 March). It is that Europe's urban areas can become the power stations of the future. The EU building standards directive seeks to reduce the energy use in buildings to 120kw/h m². Most of Europe's urban buildings use two to three times this. So, as both Caroline and George acknowledge, the first step to decarbonisation must be to lower consumption through waste reduction. However, it is the next step that has not yet been recognised. Europe's larger urban areas have the potential to meet such reduced energy demand from the renewable energy-generating potential of their land and buildings. Metropolitan energy self-sufficiency is conceivable and achievable, with all the benefits for energy security, stable energy prices and competitiveness that this could bring. Energy saving can fund the required renewable energy investment. We could have a decarbonised urban Europe in 20 to 30 years and greenhouse gas emissions would not then be an issue. A major European project is coming to its conclusion shortly and the evidence will be made public.

Under a special state secrets bill expected to pass on Friday, public officials and private citizens who leak \"special state secrets\" face prison terms of up to 10 years, while journalists who seek to obtain the classified information could get up to five years. Critics of the new law say it marks a return to the days of prewar and wartime Japanese militarism, when the state used the Peace Preservation Act to arrest and imprison political opponents. \"It is a threat to democracy,\" said Keiichi Kiriyama, an editorial writer for the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, adding that the legislation would \"have a chilling effect on public servants, who could become wary about giving the information\" to journalists. In the aftermath of the Edward Snowden leaks, Japan has come under pressure from Washington to better protect state secrets – including intelligence shared by the US – at a time of rising regional tensions. Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says the law is crucial if his US-style national security council, approved this week, is to function properly. The law is seen as part of his conservative project to bolster Japan's security in response to escalating tensions with China and concern over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Abe, who does not have to fight an election for another three years, is expected to push ahead with his nationalist agenda, including constitutional reforms that would end the military's purely defensive role. The secrecy bill's hasty passage through the lower house has been marked by noisy public demonstrations and opposition from journalists, lawyers, politicians, academics and scientists, as well as film directors and manga artists concerned about freedom of expression. They say the prospect of prison terms will deter whistleblowers from leaking sensitive or embarrassing information in the public interest, and journalists from trying to obtain it. The upper house of Japan's parliament is expected to approve the bill before the end of the current parliamentary session on Friday, possibly later on Thursday. The chief criticism of the bill is its vague definition of what constitutes a state secret, potentially giving officials carte blanche to block the release of information on a vast range of subjects, including measures to counterbalance China's growing military influence in the region, and the safety of the country's nuclear reactors. \"There are few specifics in the law, which means it can be used to hide whatever the government wishes to keep away from public scrutiny,\" said Mizuho Fukushima, an opposition MP. \"In its current form, the prime minister can decide by himself what constitutes a secret.\" The law would apply to four areas – defence, diplomacy, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage – and gives officials the power to keep sensitive information out of the public domain indefinitely. Senior politicians insist the law will not be used to gag the press or restrict the public's right to know. But the justice minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, refused to rule out police raids of newspapers suspected of breaking the law. Masako Mori, the state minister in charge of the bill, said the law could be applied to Japan's nuclear power industry, because it is a potential target for terrorists. But she denied the legislation would affect the release of information about radiation leaks at Fukushima Daiichi. Last week, the secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic party, Shigeru Ishiba, angered many when he likened people protesting against the bill to terrorists. He later apologised for the remarks. \"There is a demand by the established political forces for greater control over the people,\" said Lawrence Repeta, a law professor at Meiji University. \"This fits with the notion that the state should have broad authority to act in secret. It seems very clear that the law would have a chilling effect on journalism in Japan.\" Widespread opposition to the law is testing Abe's popularity. A recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found public support for Abe has dropped to below 50% for the first time since he took office last December. More than 60% of those polled expressed concern that the bill was being rushed into law. In response, Abe this week attempted to dismiss claims that officials would abuse the law to prevent the disclosure of information that is in the public interest. \"There is a misunderstanding,\" he said. \"It is obvious that normal reporting activity of journalists must not be a subject to punishment.\" Abe said the government would set clearer definitions of state secrets and appoint a third party to oversee possible violations. Critics point out that the proposed body, comprising senior officials from the foreign and defence ministries and the national police agency, is far from independent. \"What we need is a third party, not a quasi-third-party system that can check,\" said Banri Kaieda, leader of the main opposition Democratic party of Japan. \"I can say with certainty now that the bill is created by bureaucrats for the bureaucrats to hide information.\" The prospect of harsh penalties for Snowden-style whistleblowers and their reporter associates has prompted concern outside Japan. Reporters Without Borders accused Japan of \"making investigative journalism illegal\". It said in a statement: \"How can the government respond to growing demands for transparency from a public outraged by the consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident if it enacts a law that gives it a free hand to classify any information considered too sensitive as a state secret?\" Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, accused Japan's government of imposing the legislation with little public debate. \"They should not rush through the law without first putting in proper safeguards for access of information and freedom of expression as guaranteed in Japan's constitution and international human rights law,\" she said. The law reflects a decline in Japan's standing as a protector of the free press. In the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index for 2013, it dropped 31 places from 2012 to a new low of 53rd out of 179 countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/18/the-best-popular-science-books-of-2014-physics","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-18T10:39:03Z","webTitle":"The best science books of 2014: chemistry, physics, maths | @GrrlScientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/18/the-best-popular-science-books-of-2014-physics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/18/the-best-popular-science-books-of-2014-physics","fields":{"headline":"The best popular science books of 2014: Physical sciences","bodyText":"Today, I continue my series of “best of 2014” books lists by sharing the maths, physics, astronomy, chemistry and earth sciences books that I consider to be amongst the best published this year in this genre of popular sciences.

How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg [480 pages, The Penguin Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/audiobook download/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do -- the whole world is shot through with it. Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman -- minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God. Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how. . Wizards, Aliens, and Starships: Physics and Math in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Charles L. Adler [392 pages, Princeton University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: From teleportation and space elevators to alien contact and interstellar travel, science fiction and fantasy writers have come up with some brilliant and innovative ideas. Yet how plausible are these ideas--for instance, could Mr. Weasley’s flying car in the Harry Potter books really exist? Which concepts might actually happen, and which ones wouldn’t work at all? Wizards, Aliens, and Starships delves into the most extraordinary details in science fiction and fantasy --such as time warps, shape changing, rocket launches, and illumination by floating candle -- and shows readers the physics and math behind the phenomena. With simple mathematical models, and in most cases using no more than high school algebra, Charles Adler ranges across a plethora of remarkable imaginings, from the works of Ursula K. Le Guin to Star Trek and Avatar, to explore what might become reality. Adler explains why fantasy in the Harry Potter and Dresden Files novels cannot adhere strictly to scientific laws, and when magic might make scientific sense in the muggle world. He examines space travel and wonders why it isn’t cheaper and more common today. Adler also discusses exoplanets and how the search for alien life has shifted from radio communications to space-based telescopes. He concludes by investigating the future survival of humanity and other intelligent races. Throughout, he cites an abundance of science fiction and fantasy authors, and includes concise descriptions of stories as well as an appendix on Newton’s laws of motion. Wizards, Aliens, and Starships will speak to anyone wanting to know about the correct -- and incorrect -- science of science fiction and fantasy. . Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges [768 pages, Princeton University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/audio download/kindle UK; Amazon US paperback/audio download/kindle US] \n<strong>Publisher’s synopsis: It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades -- all before his suicide at age forty-one. This acclaimed biography of the founder of computer science, with a new preface by the author that addresses Turing’s royal pardon in 2013, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. Capturing both the inner and outer drama of Turing’s life, Andrew Hodges tells how Turing’s revolutionary idea of 1936 -- the concept of a universal machine -- laid the foundation for the modern computer and how Turing brought the idea to practical realisation in 1945 with his electronic design. The book also tells how this work was directly related to Turing’s leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. At the same time, this is the tragic account of a man who, despite his wartime service, was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program -- all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime. The inspiration for a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, Alan Turing: The Enigma is a gripping story of mathematics, computers, cryptography, and homosexual persecution. . Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age by W. Bernard Carlson [520 pages, Princeton University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/audio download/mp3 CD/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/audiobook download/mp3 CD/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century. His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America’s first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla’s private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an “idealist” inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla’s visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs. . Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World by Mark Miodownik [272 pages, Penguin Book Group, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/audio CD] Publisher’s synopsis: Why is glass see-through? What makes elastic stretchy? Why does a paper clip bend? Why does any material look and behave the way it does? These are the sorts of questions that Mark Miodownik is constantly asking himself. A globally-renowned materials scientist, Miodownik has spent his life exploring objects as ordinary as an envelope and as unexpected as concrete cloth, uncovering the fascinating secrets that hold together our physical world. In Stuff Matters, Miodownik entertainingly examines the materials he encounters in a typical morning, from the steel in his razor and the graphite in his pencil to the foam in his sneakers and the concrete in a nearby skyscraper. He offers a compendium of the most astounding histories and marvelous scientific breakthroughs in the material world, including: The imprisoned alchemist who saved himself from execution by creating the first European porcelain. The hidden gem of the Milky Way, a planet five times the size of Earth, made entirely of diamond. Graphene, the thinnest, strongest, stiffest material in existence — only a single atom thick — that could be used to make entire buildings sensitive to touch. From the teacup to the jet engine, the silicon chip to the paper clip, the plastic in our appliances to the elastic in our underpants, our lives are overflowing with materials. Full of enthralling tales of the miracles of engineering that permeate our lives, Stuff Matters will make you see stuff in a whole new way. [My review] Winner of the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books. . Seven Elements that Changed the World: An Adventure of Ingenuity and Discovery by John Browne [288 pages, Pegasus Books, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback] Publisher’s synopsis: With carbon we access heat, light and mobility at the flick of a switch, while silicon enables us to communicate across the globe in an instant. Yet our use of the Earth’s mineral resources is not always for the benefit of humankind -- our relationship with the elements is one of great ambivalence. Uranium is both productive (nuclear power) and destructive (nuclear bombs); iron is the bloody weapon of war, but also the economic tool of peace; our desire for alluring gold is the foundation of global trade, but has also led to the death of millions. John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum (BP) for twelve years, vividly describes how seven elements are shaping the world around us, for better and for worse. Combining history, science, and politics, Seven Elements takes you on a present-day adventure of human passion and innovation. This journey is far from over: we continue to find surprising new uses for these seven elements. In this narrative of discovery, readers will come to understand how titanium pervades modern consumer society, how natural gas is transforming the global energy sector, and how an innovative new form of carbon could be starting a technology revolution. . Proof: The Science of Booze by Adam Rogers [272 pages, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/mp3 CD; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/mp3 CD/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: Humans have been perfecting the science of alcohol production for ten thousand years, but modern scientists are only just beginning to distill the complex reactions behind the perfect buzz. In a spirited tour across continents and cultures, Adam Rogers puts our alcoholic history under the microscope, from our ancestors’ accidental discovery of fermented drinks to the cutting-edge laboratory research that proves why -- or even if -- people actually like the stuff. From fermentation to distillation to aging, Proof offers a unique glimpse inside the barrels, stills, tanks, and casks that produce iconic drinks. Rogers ventures from the whiskey-making mecca of the Scottish Highlands to the most sophisticated gene-sequencing labs in the world -- and to more than one bar -- introducing us to the motley characters and evolving science behind the latest developments in boozy technology. He uncovers alcohol’s deepest mysteries, chasing the physics, molecular biology, organic chemistry, and even metallurgy that power alcohol production, and the subtle mixture of psychology and neurobiology that fuels our taste for those products. With intoxicating enthusiasm, Rogers reveals alcohol as a miracle of science. If you’ve ever wondered how exactly your drink of choice arrived in your glass, or exactly what will happen to you once you empty it, Proof makes an unparalleled drinking companion. . The Perfect Theory: A Century of Geniuses and the Battle over General Relativity by Prof. Pedro G. Ferreira [304 pages, Little, Brown Book Group Ltd., 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/audio CD/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/audio CD/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: Physicists have been exploring, debating, and questioning the general theory of relativity ever since Albert Einstein first presented it in 1915. Their work has uncovered a number of the universe’s more surprising secrets, and many believe further wonders remain hidden within the theory’s tangle of equations, waiting to be exposed. In this sweeping narrative of science and culture, astrophysicist Pedro Ferreira brings general relativity to life through the story of the brilliant physicists, mathematicians, and astronomers who have taken up its challenge. For these scientists, the theory has been both a treasure trove and an enigma, fueling a century of intellectual struggle and triumph. Einstein’s theory, which explains the relationships among gravity, space, and time, is possibly the most perfect intellectual achievement of modern physics, yet studying it has always been a controversial endeavor. Relativists were the target of persecution in Hitler’s Germany, hounded in Stalin’s Russia, and disdained in 1950s America. Even today, PhD students are warned that specializing in general relativity will make them unemployable. Despite these pitfalls, general relativity has flourished, delivering key insights into our understanding of the origin of time and the evolution of all the stars and galaxies in the cosmos. Its adherents have revealed what lies at the farthest reaches of the universe, shed light on the smallest scales of existence, and explained how the fabric of reality emerges. Dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and string theory are all progeny of Einstein’s theory. We are in the midst of a momentous transformation in modern physics. As scientists look farther and more clearly into space than ever before,The Perfect Theory reveals the greater relevance of general relativity, showing us where it started, where it has led, and where it can still take us. . The Accidental Universe: The World You Thought You Knew by Alan Lightman [176 pages, Vintage Books, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/paperback/audio download/audio CD/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/paperback/audiobook download/audiobook CD/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: With passion and curiosity, Alan Lightman explores the emotional and philosophical questions raised by recent discoveries in science. He looks at the dialogue between science and religion; the conflict between our human desire for permanence and the impermanence of nature; the possibility that our universe is simply an accident; the manner in which modern technology has separated us from direct experience of the world; and our resistance to the view that our bodies and minds can be explained by scientific logic and laws. Behind all of these considerations is the suggestion -- at once haunting and exhilarating -- that what we see and understand of the world is only a tiny piece of the extraordinary, perhaps unfathomable whole. . . The Science of Interstellar by Kip Thorne [336 pages, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014; Amazon UK paperback/kindle UK; Amazon US paperback/audio CD/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: Interstellar, from acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan, takes us on a fantastic voyage far beyond our solar system. Yet in The Science of Interstellar, Kip Thorne, the physicist who assisted Nolan on the scientific aspects of Interstellar, shows us that the movie’s jaw-dropping events and stunning, never-before-attempted visuals are grounded in real science. Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, Thorne’s scientific insights -- many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of Interstellar -- describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible. . . . Tambora: The Eruption That Changed the World by Gillen D’Arcy Wood [312 pages, Princeton University Press, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/audio download/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover/audio download/kindle US] Publisher’s synopsis: When Indonesia’s Mount Tambora erupted in 1815, it unleashed the most destructive wave of extreme weather the world has witnessed in thousands of years. The volcano’s massive sulfate dust cloud enveloped the Earth, cooling temperatures and disrupting major weather systems for more than three years. Amid devastating storms, drought, and floods, communities worldwide endured famine, disease, and civil unrest on a catastrophic scale. On the eve of the bicentenary of the great eruption, Tambora tells the extraordinary story of the weather chaos it wrought, weaving the latest climate science with the social history of this frightening period to offer a cautionary tale about the potential tragic impacts of drastic climate change in our own century. The year following Tambora’s eruption became known as the “Year without a Summer,” when weather anomalies in Europe and New England ruined crops, displaced millions, and spawned chaos and disease. Here, for the first time, Gillen D’Arcy Wood traces Tambora’s full global and historical reach: how the volcano’s three-year climate change regime initiated the first worldwide cholera pandemic, expanded opium markets in China, set the stage for Ireland’s Great Famine, and plunged the United States into its first economic depression. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein’s monster, inspired by Tambora’s terrifying storms, embodied the fears and misery of global humanity during this transformative period, the most recent sustained climate crisis the world has faced. Bringing the history of this planetary emergency grippingly to life, Tambora sheds light on the fragile interdependence of climate and human societies, and the threat a new era of extreme global weather poses to us all. . Island on Fire: The extraordinary story of Laki, the volcano that turned eighteenth-century Europe dark by Alexandra Witze and Jeff Kanipe [224 pages, Profile Books, 2014; Guardian bookshop; Amazon UK hardcover/kindle UK; Amazon US hardcover] Publisher’s synopsis: The eruption of Laki is one of history’s great untold natural disasters. The eruption, spewing out a poisionous fog, lasted for eight months, but its effects lingered across Europe for years, causing the death of people as far away as the Nile, and creating famine that may have triggered the French revolution. Island on Fire is the story not only of a volcano but also of the people whose lives it changed, such as the pastor Jon Steingrimsson, who witnessed and recorded the events in Iceland. It is the story, too, of modern volcanology, and looks at how events might work out should Laki erupt again in our time. .

Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Simon Russell Beale … the cast was a dream for any director. But the audience was also filled with titans of British theatre, with a guest list that seated playwrights Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer and David Hare alongside directors Richard Eyre and Peter Hall and actresses Prunella Scales and Juliet Stevenson. Also present was Joan Plowright, widow of Laurence Olivier – the National's first director and one of the last century's greatest actors. Also attending the gala occasion were Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse, Lady Antonia Fraser, the Tate's director Sir Nicholas Serota and the former archbishop of Canterbury, Lord (Rowan) Williams. \"Everyone's here. You're surrounded by famous faces,\" the anniversary show's executive producer, David Sabel, said before the final rehearsal. \"You walk down the hall and you see Jacobi and Gambon. Then Christopher Eccleston, Ralph Fiennes.\" The lineup on the main Olivier stage was there for a fully staged two-hour retrospective showcasing the scope and scale of the theatrical powerhouse under the directorship of Nicholas Hytner, who hands over the reins to Rufus Norris next year. The performance, broadcast live on BBC2, featured vignettes of some of the 800 productions staged since the National's creation in 1963. On stage, Dench demonstrated why her Egyptian queen in Antony and Cleopatra is still remembered as one of the triumphs of her long career. Smith recaptured her thoughtful performance as the unhappily married Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's The Beaux' Stratagem and Mirren mesmerised as a murderer in Eugene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra. Other performances saw Gambon and Jacobi deliver a passage from Harold Pinter's No Man's Land – paying tribute to their predecessors Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, who starred in the original – and Russell Beale reprise a critically acclaimed role as Hamlet. \"Everyone who's in the show has been part of the National Theatre company at one point and, in some cases, on many occasions,\" said Sabel. \"But what's unusual is everyone's here at the same time. In the canteen, the green room and corridors. It's incredibly exciting.\" Given the pedigree of the scripts and performers, the volume of applause was hardly unexpected. But prior to the theatre's creation many would have predicted otherwise. The theatre was born out of controversy following decades of debate over whether there was a place for a state-subsidised institution that would foster drama neglected by Britain's commercial stage industry. After it was established at the Old Vic in Waterloo, it was the focus of more arguments as the brutalist architecture of its subsequent home, which Prince Charles likened to a nuclear power station, took shape over London's South Bank. Backstage there were also personal tempestuous dramas, including a notorious feud between Peter Hall and Jonathan Miller. Hall succeeded Olivier as head of the National in 1973, prompting Miller, an associate director, to resign within months. Miller dismissed Hall as a \"safari-suited bureaucrat\" and Hall called Miller \"the only director I know who always likes his own work\". Miller, a pioneering artistic director for the Old Vic, was conspicuous by his absence, although he had been invited and the programme notes record that the National's fortunes revived in 1972 with his The School for Scandal. Miller told the Observer: \"They invited me, but I haven't even bothered to reply. Why on earth should I go somewhere which has never asked me for 35 years? There's no point in my being there.\" Apart from his 2011 staging of Bach's St Matthew Passion – which \"I managed to bully them into allowing me to do\" – he feels that he has been \"conspicuously ignored\". Daniel Rosenthal, author of a forthcoming book on the National, said that the institution had succeeded by supporting new writing and recognising potential. \"Wherever you are in the world, every night there's a play that began its life at the National,\" he said. \"Patrick Marber's Closer has been seen in more than 100 cities worldwide. The film version in the UK and US alone was seen by five million.\" As if to prove the point, the programme notes record that Stoppard, who has given the National a new play in every decade, was an \"untried writer\" in 1967 when it staged his now-classic Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. An extract was performed. That there have been so many classics to emerge from the National was cause for consternation for Hytner, who wrote in the anniversary performance's programme: \"Although we've tried to cover as much as possible … I'm horrified by how much we've had to leave out.\" The enduring relevance of its stand-out works was demonstrated by the bill, which featured plays that resonated with current debates about media ownership and education, such as Pravda, Hare and Howard Brenton's incisive 1980s play about a newspaper baron – played last night by Fiennes – and Alan Bennett's The History Boys. The live performances were interspersed with archival footage including Paul Scofield as Salieri in Amadeus, Shaffer's masterpiece. The night also featured a short film about Olivier, which included recent footage of Plowright reprising her role of St Joan shot at the Old Vic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2013/dec/04/government-privatisation-eurostar-danny-alexander","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-04T09:51:11Z","webTitle":"Danny Alexander: government should not own things it does not need to own","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/04/government-privatisation-eurostar-danny-alexander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/dec/04/government-privatisation-eurostar-danny-alexander","fields":{"headline":"Danny Alexander: government should not own things it does not need to own","bodyText":"The government will sell off assets it does not need to raise money, Danny Alexander has said, as he set out plans to dispose of Britain's stake in Eurostar as part of a £20bn privatisation programme. Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will announce on Wednesday that he has doubled the coalition's target for the disposal of state assets to £20bn over the next six years, just weeks after the government was criticised for undervaluing Royal Mail during its controversial flotation. The disposal of the UK's 40% stake in Eurostar could potentially net the Treasury hundreds of millions of pounds. The higher target for privatisations will lead to speculation about which other businesses in the government's estimated £600bn corporate and property portfolio will be sold in the coming years. Assets held by the state include Channel 4 and support services businesses such as Companies House, the Royal Mint, the Met Office and Ordnance Survey, as well as the Post Office. In the past, coalition ministers have maintained that the Eurostar stake would be retained. The company, which is majority-owned by the French state rail firm, SNCF, more than doubled profits to £52m last year. The surprise announcement comes weeks after ministers were criticised for allowing Eurostar to bid for the state-owned east coast mainline, amid concerns it would create a conflict of interest. The selloff also comes at a time of debate about private versus public ownership of the railways, with criticism of soaring fares and poor performance by many franchises. Labour is opposing the sale of the east coast mainline and has indicated it would allow publicly owned companies to operate railways on the same terms as private companies. Ministers are already trying to sell a series of taxpayer-owned assets to help pay down the UK's debts, including a £3bn stake in the nuclear firm Urenco. The coalition recently sold the blood company Plasma UK for £200m and part of the student loan book to a consortium of investment funds for £160m. Further privatisations could be fiercely opposed by the unions, which have threatened strike action over the Royal Mail selloff. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Alexander said: \"What we're doing today … is raising our ambition in terms of corporate asset sales. It's right that we should do that; government shouldn't own things it doesn't need to own, particularly when those resources could be reinvested in productive economic infrastructure. \"We've set out already, we've started to sell off some of the student loan book, that would be another area, there are assets owned by the London and Continental Railways, things that a lot of people wouldn't have thought the state owned in the first place. \"What I'm setting out today is an ambition with some examples of things we think we could sell. Clearly no final decisions have been made about any of those assets, but clearly the point is that where government owns assets that could be better managed in the private sector, could be more efficiently managed in the private sector and where we can get money in to reinvest in vital infrastructure projects that get this country moving, that support the long-term economic growth of this country, they can back up the vote of confidence that we're seeing from the private sector.\" The latest privatisation round will be detailed as part of an updated national infrastructure plan set out by Alexander in a speech at the Institution of Civil Engineers, in which he will say the value of planned projects in Britain has now risen by 20% to £375bn, with more than a quarter to be provided with public money and the rest from the private sector. Alexander will announce: • Billions of pounds of public money will be used to back the new Wylfa nuclear power station, due to be built by Japanese investors Hitachi on Anglesey. The Treasury has signed an agreement that it will guarantee loans to the project in future – enabling Hitachi to get cheap finance – in a deal similar to the one offered to France's EDF to build a nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, Somerset. • Large insurance companies have put aside £25bn for spending on national infrastructure over the next five years, following changes in European rules pushed for by the UK that provide incentives for investment in a wider range of assets. • Plans to bring in the UK's first toll road for a decade have been scrapped. Improvements to the A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon will be financed by the government and not by the motorists using the road, after a public outcry and David Cameron's acknowledgment of \"strong feelings\" in East Anglia. • Terms have been agreed on a £1bn guarantee for the London Underground's Northern line extension to Battersea. • An extra £50m will be allocated to redevelop the railway station at Gatwick airport. Describing the £25bn investment by insurers as a \"massive vote of confidence\", Alexander will say Britain's infrastructure is being rebuilt after years of neglect. \"It supports the wider £100bn public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the spending round 2013. Underground, overground, on shore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we're building it right now,\" he will say. The response from the CBI business group was tentative, with Katja Hall, its chief policy director, saying \"the devil will be in the detail on timelines and delivery\". Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, accused the government of \"complete failure\" over infrastructure, as official statistics show work on projects is down 3.7% in the past year and fell by 10% in 2012. \"Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground.\" On Tuesday night, the Treasury said 99% of the government's 27 priority road, rail and flood projects are on target. Two have been completed so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jul/11/dangerous-global-warming-reversed-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-11T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Dangerous global warming could be reversed, say scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/11/dangerous-global-warming-reversed-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jul/11/dangerous-global-warming-reversed-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Dangerous global warming could be reversed, say scientists","bodyText":"Global warming could be reversed using a combination of burning trees and crops for energy, and capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground (CCS), according to an analysis by scientists. But experts cautioned that trying such an approach after temperatures had passed dangerous levels could be problematic, as climate change reduced the number of trees available for \"bioenergy\". The bioenergy and CCS method was the most cost-effective way of tackling carbon emissions, said the team at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, publishing their research in the journal Environmental Research Letters on Thursday. Such an approach could offset and even reverse other emissions from fossil fuels, they claimed. The lead author of the study, Prof Christian Azar, said it could help bring temperatures down even if they rose above the 2C level that world leaders have agreed to avoid: \"Even if current political gridlock causes global warming in excess of 2C, we can reverse the temperature trend and reach targets later. This means that 2C targets, or even more ambitious targets, can remain on the table in international climate negotiations.\" He said that to achieve a reversal of temperatures, the combination of bioenergy and CCS would need to be combined with a huge expansion in renewable energy or nuclear power, in order to reduce emissions almost to zero. He also admitted that there was a political risk that the proposal's ability to reverse rises at a late stage could be used as an excuse for short-term inaction on emissions. CCS technology has been tested successfully on small-scale trials, but is still unproven at commercial scale anywhere in the world. Environmentalists have also questioned the carbon benefits of burning trees for power, saying that in some cases the \"lifecycle\" emissions are worse than coal. Dr Vivian Scott of Scottish Carbon Capture Storage at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the research, said that the basis for the research's conclusion was sound, but he warned it should not be interpreted \"as a 'get out of jail free' card in 50 years' time\" and the idea could be hamstrung by climate change itself. \"As shown in this work, Beccs [Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage] could offer a way back from exceeding climate targets. However, there are potentially huge consequences to allowing an overshoot [of those targets]. A warmer climate for even a limited period could profoundly alter meteorological and ecological systems – changes which could perhaps even restrict the ability to produce the biomass on which we might be reliant to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide content,\" he said. He also said that reducing carbon emissions to zero could be a major challenge, given the track record of previous efforts to cut carbon: \"Progress in addressing emissions has been woefully slow - the International Energy Agency recently announced that the average amount of carbon dioxide produced for each unit of energy generated has barely changed in the period 1990 - 2010 … in essence all the emissions mitigation efforts to date have achieved almost nothing\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/apr/16/earthquake-hits-iran-pakistan-border","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-16T13:39:00Z","webTitle":"7.8-magnitude earthquake hits near Iran-Pakistan border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/earthquake-hits-iran-pakistan-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/16/earthquake-hits-iran-pakistan-border","fields":{"headline":"7.8-magnitude earthquake hits near Iran-Pakistan border","bodyText":"A powerful earthquake has hit the border regions between Iran and Pakistan, with reports of casualties currently confused. Communications to the region near the epicentre, in a remote corner of the south-east of Iran, appear to be cut off. Tremors were felt across the Gulf region, across Pakistan and well into north-west India on Tuesday, when the quake happened at 10.44am GMT. The US Geological Survey said it had measured the earthquake at magnitude 7.8 and gave its location at 50 miles east-south-east of the town of Khash, in Iran. It is the biggest earthquake in Iran for 40 years. Though the area is largely desert and mountains, there are several major cities, including Zahedan, 125 miles away, which has more than half a million inhabitants. One Iranian told the Guardian that the small town of Hiduj, which had a population of around 1,000 according to a 2006 census, had been badly damaged. The Iranian semi-official news agency Fars quoted Tehran University's geophysics centre as saying the quake had hit the south-eastern city of Saravan in Sistan and Baluchistan province, at 3.14pm local time and reported that it had killed at least 40 people, according to some of their sources. At least seven villages near the city had been affected, the agency said. But Fars also quoted Fariborz Rashedi, the head of medical emergencies for Sistan and Baluchistan, as saying the situation in his province was \"normal\", with only three people injured. On the Pakistan side, the situation seemed just as confused. \"We have reports of three deaths near the Pakistan-Iran border in MashKhel area of Panjgore district,\" said a local government official, requesting anonymity. The official added that around 40 people had been injured when wooden roofs and mud walls collapsed. The sparsely populated district is one of Pakistan's most underdeveloped, with minimal telecommunication and infrastructure. There is no official announcement of a death toll by Pakistan's disaster management authority. However, a police officer in the Kalat district, near the provincial capital of Quetta, said they are assessing the damage in towns along to the Iranian border. There are reports of panic in Karachi where residential buildings and government offices have developed cracks. Saleh Mangi, from the NGO Plan International, said he was in a meeting with staff in their office in Thatta, around 65 miles from the port city, when they felt the ground shake. \"It was horrible – we felt the movement in the chairs and even the cupboards were shaking. This is the strongest quake I have felt since the 1980s. And this is an area prone to earthquakes and cyclones.\" \"We sounded our emergency alarm and emergency alarms were going off in the houses around us. Everyone was pouring out of their homes and offices. People were afraid and didn't know what was happening. People are afraid to go back to their homes and the government is telling fishing communities [on the coast] not to go into the sea as that would be very dangerous.\" Close to 8 magnitude means an extremely powerful quake, on a level with the one that killed an estimated 68,000 people in Sichuan province, China, in 2008. An Iranian citizen in the southern city of Shiraz, about 650 miles from the epicentre, said the quake was felt there. There was concern that facilities associated with Iran's controversial nuclear programme might have been affected. A witness in Saravan told BBC's Persian service: \"The earthquake was felt gravely across the city and the old part of the city as well as its main sport centre have been destroyed but thanks God because it could be worse.\" Ahmad-Reza Shajiee, the deputy head of Iran's Red Crescent, told the state Irna news agency that there was a complicated emergency situation in affected areas in Sistan and Baluchistan. \"Soon after we received the news about the quake, a crisis meeting was held and a group of rescuers from the Red Crescent society were dispatched to Sistan and Baluchistan province,\" he said. But the Bushehr nuclear power plant was not damaged, said an official at the Russian firm that built the plant. The official at Atomstroyexport, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had spoken to a colleague at the plant after the quake and that no damage was reported. Bushehr, Iran's sole nuclear power plant, is near the Gulf coast in western Iran. There was no immediate independent confirmation of his statement. In Delhi, India, more than 1,500 miles from the suspected epicentre, office workers evacuated buildings as fittings shook and windows rattled. Tremors lasted for around 30 seconds. \"It was very frightening. Everything started moving. I ran into the street,\" said Ghautam Menon, an office worker in the south of the Indian capital. In 2003, a major quake near the Iranian city of Bam, not far from Tuesday's epicentre, killed 30,000. Iran experiences earthquakes frequently. A week ago, a 6.1-magnitude quake hit near Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf coast, killing at least 37 people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2013/jan/16/cumbria-tourism-chiefs-oppose-nuclear-waste-burial","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-16T18:50:39Z","webTitle":"'Nuclear waste?

No thanks,' say Lake District national park tourism chiefs","bodyText":"Cumbria's tourism board has joined the growing clamour against any further research into the burying of nuclear power station waste within the borders of the Lake District national park. The board – which oversees the park, the county's largest earner and one of the most-visited group of attractions in the UK – has also stated its strong opposition to investigations in the Solway Coast area of outstanding natural beauty on the West Cumbrian side of the famous lakes and fells. Eric Robson, chair of Cumbria Tourism, has written to Baroness Verma, the junior energy minister handling the controversial issue. He told her the board remains neutral on the overall question of burying waste in Cumbria, pending detailed investigations which are under way. A crucial meeting of the three councils potentially affected – Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland districts – will decide on 30 January whether to agree to full-scale preliminary planning for a repository whose underground facilities would cover an area larger than the nearby town of Workington. The three councils are the only ones in the UK still considering a government request to provide underground nuclear storage, but Cumbria's fractured geology has already narrowed potential areas to limited parts of the western coast, including the Ennerdale valley in the national park. There were gasps at public meetings in November when mock-ups of the possible construction project were shown. The projections, based on a French scheme, showed how construction and surface maintenance buildings might irrevocably scar the beautiful foothills of legendary fells such as Great Gable and Pillar. The Lake District national park authority has already signalled its opposition to any incursion, with heavyweight allies such as the National Trust ready to provide support. Bill Jefferson, the authority's chair, wrote to Verma in November warning of potentially disastrous effects on both the landscape and the tourism economy. He said after the public meetings: \"Tourism brings in far more than Sellafield [nuclear power complex] ever would, and let's face it, there are going to be more than enough jobs in dealing with the clear-up and improvement of above-ground storage which is happening there. \"We have 15 million people coming to the park every year, and the prospect of having the world's largest nuclear waste dump could make that considerably fewer.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/dec/20/strictly-come-dancing-bbc-national-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-20T10:30:00Z","webTitle":"Strictly Come Dancing: National Grid prepares for biggest surge of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/strictly-come-dancing-bbc-national-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/20/strictly-come-dancing-bbc-national-grid","fields":{"headline":"Strictly Come Dancing: National Grid prepares for biggest surge of the year","bodyText":"As the sparkling smiles of the Strictly Come Dancing winners fade from the screen on Saturday evening, the first people to know just how engrossed the British public were will be a team of engineers in a secret and secure location west of London. \"We can tell how much an event is gripping the nation,\" says Nigel Williams, head of electricity systems operations at the National Grid. His team plan for weeks ahead so that when the nation heaves itself off the sofa and puts the kettle on, power stations across the country burst into life within seconds to stop the surge in electricity demand turning the lights off. In the national control centre, a cross between space mission control and a city trading floor, one man will watch the live television feed with his finger hovering over the button. Even in today's multi-channel, time-shifting world of entertainment, these \"TV pickups\" remain the biggest challenge for the grid engineers in balancing the electricity grid from second to second. The largest number on the huge display screens in the control room is the frequency of the electricity supply, which must remain very close to 50 hertz. \"That frequency is the heartbeat of the nation,\" says Williams. The hour-by-hour pulse of the electrical signal also reveals how traditional most Brits remain when it comes to Christmas itself. \"People's behaviour always surprises me in that it is so predictable,\" says Williams. \"You get exactly the same curve on Christmas day, year after year after year.\" The usual workday surge in the morning disappears, replaced by a slow rise towards the lunchtime peak as millions of turkeys are roasted in ovens. Boxing day morning is also a notable day for the grid engineers, representing the most peaceful national moment of the year. \"It's the lowest of the low,\" he says. However, one tradition has been lost, according to Jeremy Caplin, energy forecasting manager at the National Grid. \"There used to be a pickup for the Queen's speech, but not so much now,\" he says. A physicist by training, Caplin has had to become an expert on TV schedules and thinks the BBC's Strictly final is likely to be the biggest spike of the festive period. He also has to track soap plotlines, having been caught napping by a massive TV pickup after the siege in Emmerdale in October. Other surprises this year included The Day of the Doctor in November, which won a big audience but resulted in no grid surge. \"Either the programmes after grabbed people's attention or Doctor Who fans don't drink coffee,\" he says. The biggest challenge of the year was Andy Murray's triumph at Wimbledon. \"It's impossible to predict how many sets the match would go to or when it was going to end,\" he says. The size of the TV pickups, exacerbated because the nation's inactivity during the event causes a trough before the peak, can be huge: equivalent to the entire electricity use of London. While TV pickups are the biggest variable second to second, the key factor determining the peak electricity use for the day is the weather. But even there people's behaviour matters: the \"misery factor\" is important, says Caplin. For example, if it is windy or raining, people coming home chilled and wet whack up the heating more than if it was the same temperature outside but clear-skied. \"There is an underlying science – we know the impact of weather – but there is an element of judgment too,\" he says. Preventing the nation's fairy lights going out can take 1,000 balancing actions a day, says Williams, but the increasing use of intermittent renewable energy is not a problem. \"When we first got wind on the grid we had a few choppy days, but we are managing it very well now,\" he says. \"Our forecasting is very good.\" The grid gets useful wind forecasts 10 days ahead, and 24 hours ahead can predict the amount of electricity that will be generated to within 4%. Earlier in December, a wind power record was set of 6GW – equivalent to six big power stations and 14% of all electricity at the time – and the grid then managed a 2.5GW dropoff over a few hours as winds surpassed safety limits in many places. \"I don't see an upper limit to how much wind we can accommodate [on the grid]\", says Williams, who also notes that 86% of payments to companies to stop generating when the grid is getting overloaded go to coal and gas, not wind. National Grid, whose charges make up about 4% of electricity bills, has also seen the traditional evening lighting peak lowered by the widespread use of low energy bulbs. Overall, says Williams, \"we like a nice balanced portfolio of generation sources, so if you have trouble in the Ukraine or a miners' strike, you can deal with it.\" He said the huge new nuclear power stations being planned would provide significant, stable power but were not essential: \"You could do without nuclear as long as you get the volume [of electricity] from elsewhere.\" He said the much larger size of the new reactors incurred more costs to the grid, as they have to increase the capacity to hand to ensure the network would cope if the reactors tripped offline. Williams described the recent warnings of blackouts made by energy company bosses as scaremongering. \"We have always had periods when there is a bit of a crunch and we have managed that,\" he says. \"People talk about winters of discontent and blackouts, but what we are talking about in the worst-case scenario is a few half-hour periods a year. It's most likely we'd reduce the frequency a bit, so lights would dim a little and hairdryers would be a little less hot. Most people would not notice.\" While the National Grid has to anticipate people's behaviour to keep the lights on, in particular predict TV hits, it does not mean its staff always agrees with the audience's choices. \"The TV pickup from Deal or No Deal is gobsmackingly high,\" said Williams. \"How sad is that?\" • This article was amended on 26 June 2014. An earlier version contained an error in the quote by Nigel Williams: \"...who also notes that 98% of payments to companies to stop generating when the grid is getting overloaded go to coal and gas, not wind\".

The French-owned company is in talks with ministers over \"contracts for difference\" funding, under which the government guarantees generators will be paid a minimum price for electricity from new nuclear plants: if the market price falls lower than this \"strike price\" then a surcharge will be added to customers' bills; if it rises higher there would be a refund. The Guardian reported on Tuesday that in order to keep the strike price at below the politically crucial £100 a megawatt hour, ministers and officials are proposing the contracts will last for up to 40 years, double the original timescale. On Tuesday, it emerged that EDF's chairman, Henri Proglio, told analysts and investors that the company was in talks over 40-year contracts when the company published its annual results in Paris last week. The UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said on Monday no final agreement had been reached. However insiders acknowledge such long deals could have trouble passing EU state aid rules, and nuclear critics who are already angry the government has reneged on a promise that there would be no public subsidy for new nuclear power. Pressure on ministers to get a deal with EDF was highlighted on Tuesday when Alistair Buchanan, head of the energy regulator, Ofgem, warned that UK customers face higher bills for years to come as gas imports rise to replace ageing power stations taken out of service. In an attack on previous policy, Buchanan said the situation had arisen because of \"the car crash of a policy-driven vision of sustainability and the environment from 2004-08 – that needed massive sums of money backing nascent technologies – smashing into the financial crisis.\" Energy experts said longer contracts for new nuclear power would help bring the price guarantee down from early estimates of £140-160 per unit to under £100, and bring down the overall cost because they would reduce risk and make it cheaper for EDF to borrow the estimated £12bn-£16bn building cost. \"At the moment that certainty would appear to be more of a benefit to the owner-operator of a new plant, but clearly the government needs to get things moving on generation new builds,\" said Martin Young, head of European utilities research at Nomura. \"It would support the government's low-carbon policy and reduce the volatility in power prices.\" But ministers could also face a headache if energy companies demand similar subsidies to build new gas plants. \"This is a real possibility because the incentive to build new gas power plants is lost if market prices are distorted by significant nuclear capacity supported by very rich contracts for difference,\" said Nigel Robinson, head of power advisory at Investec bank. According to Ofgem, gas is likely to double to 60% to 70% of power generation by the end of this decade. Buchanan said reserve margins for generation capacity were set to fall from 14% to 5% within three years, though he played down the threat of power cuts to households because many energy-intensive industries have contracts that stipulate their supply can be cut at times of peak demand. His warnings are a challenge to the chancellor, George Osborne, who has promoted a \"dash for gas\" as the way of keeping the lights on and keeping energy bills low for consumers and businesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/02/ukraine-warns-russia-crimea-war-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-03T00:37:19Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian and Russian troops in standoff at Crimean military base - As it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/ukraine-warns-russia-crimea-war-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/02/ukraine-warns-russia-crimea-war-live","fields":{"headline":"Ukrainian and Russian troops in standoff at Crimean military base - As it happened","bodyText":"• Russian troops have surrounded at least two military bases in Crimea and approached others seeking to gain access or get hold or their weapons.

We are going to wrap up our liveblog coverage for now, but will be back soon. The White House has put out a statement following separate telephone discussions involving President Barack Obama and the leaders of Britain, Germany and Poland. It said: The leaders stressed that dialogue between Ukraine and Russia should start immediately, with international facilitation as appropriate. The four leaders also emphasised their support for Ukraine and its efforts to hold elections in May, the White House said. The Australian government has summoned the Russian ambassador to explain his country’s actions in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the secretary of her department, Peter Varghese, will meet with Ambassador Vladimir Morozov on Monday. Bishop told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: We’ll express our concerns officially, directly through him and also seek to ascertain exactly what the Russian government thinks it’s doing. Asked if her government was considering expelling the envoy, Bishop replied: “Well, first thing’s first.” Australia has made clear its unequivocal support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty and that the use of force was “completely unacceptable,” she said. The BBC’s indomitable Nick Sutton, nightly tweeter of tomorrow’s Fleet Street front pages, notes that Ukraine leads on most. Among them, The Sun has its own characteristic take on the crisis. What’s likely to happen further down the road in terms of future Russian policy towards neighbouring states as a result of the crisis? Tatyana Malyarenko, a Donetsk-based academic, has been mulling over this question along with Stefan Wolff of the University of Birmingham. In a piece for the London-based website, The Conversation, they write: Beyond Moldova, or more precisely Transnistria, Russia has nowhere else to go in the former Soviet empire that would pose a major threat to Western interests that could not be effectively countered or preempted. And the leverage that Russia can exercise through Transnistria is far more limited than in the case of Crimea. More here. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker has been given exclusive access to the inside of a Ukrainian marine base in Feodosia, Crimea, which has been surrounded by Russian troops. Shaun describes how confusion has descended at times: Inside the base at Feodosia, word came that the order had come from Kiev that all marines should give up their weapons voluntarily to the Russians. One of the marines then read on Facebook that the news was apparently fake, and rushed off to inform his superiors who were in negotiations with Russians. Many of the marines were on the phone to friends at other bases, asking whether they had been forced to give up their weapons. Those inside the base have been asked “firmly but politely” by the Russians to give up their weapons. Shaun asked one marine what would happen if the Russians came with orders rather than requests. He was told: I am Russian myself, I was born there but we are professional soldiers and we have given an oath of duty. We will not give up this place without a fight. They are unconfirmed, but there have been reports of explosions in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, where Russian troops have surrounded a Ukrainian army base. However... The US has signalled that it could give as much financial support as Ukraine needs to get the country’s economy back on track. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who has urged Kiev to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund, said Washington could lend a hand either through bilateral programs or larger international institutions. Lew told a conference that the The United States is prepared to work with its bilateral and multilateral partners to provide as much support as Ukraine needs. Members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s human rights council have urged him not to invade Ukraine, saying threats faced by Russians there were far from severe enough to warrant sending in troops. A statement signed by 27 members of the advisory body reflected deep concern among Russian liberals, according to a Reuters report. While the Kremlin says that Russian citizens are under threat from militant supporters of the new government in Kiev, members of the Presidential Council on the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights argues that those concerns are overblown. The council, which consists of public figures from NGOs, the media and arts, academia and busines stated: True, there are known cases of lawlessness and violence carried out by representatives of various political forces. But the use of external military force, linked with the violation of the sovereignty of a neighbouring state and contradicting Russia’s international obligations, is completely inappropriate to the scale of the violations, in our opinion. A senior US official has said that Russian forces “now have complete operational control of the Crimean Peninsula.” The Guardian’s Jon Swaine reports that the official estimated that 6,000 Russian forces “with considerable materiel” were in the region and were flying in reinforcements. The officials told a conference call with reporters that there had also been “occasional ethnic skirmishes in parts of the east” of Ukraine, and that there was particular concern about the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, where “efforts to stir up ethnic Russians” against Kiev had been detected. “We are concerned as we watch this situation that the Russians have badly miscalculated,” one senior official said. “There is a very fierce and proud tradition in Ukraine of defending their sovereignty and territorial integrity. “So far Ukraine has showed, and Ukrainians individually have showed, marked restraint ... but the longer this situation goes on, the more delicate it becomes”. Officials said Kerry would travel to Kiev on Tuesday to meet the interim Ukrainian government and discuss American support. Plans for a trip to Moscow by the US trade representative and a visit by Russian officials on energy cooperation have both been cancelled. Hysteria seems to be the mood in Washington and Kiev, according to Guardian columnist Jonathan Steele, who argues that US moves to punish Russia and Nato’s decision to respond to calls by Kiev by holding a meeting of member states’ ambassadors in Brussels today were mistakes. He adds: Nato should refrain from interfering in Ukraine by word or deed. The fact that it insists on getting engaged reveals the elephant in the room: underlying the crisis in Crimea and Russia’s fierce resistance to potential changes is Nato’s undisguised ambition to continue two decades of expansion into what used to be called “post-Soviet space”, led by Bill Clinton and taken up by successive administrations in Washington. At the back of Pentagon minds, no doubt, is the dream that a US navy will one day replace the Russian Black Sea fleet in the Crimean ports of Sevastopol and Balaclava. Prince Edward, patron of the British Paralympic Association, has cancelled a planned visit to Russia to attend the Sochi Paralympic Games, according to Buckingham Palace. The palace said that the prince was acting on the advice of the British government, according to the Press Association. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has said on Twitter that he is going to the Ukrainian capital tomorrow night: A US official told Reuters that, in Kiev, Kerry will stress US political and economic support. A statement from the Department of State has more details, saying: In Kyiv on March 4, Secretary Kerry will meet with senior representatives of Ukraine’s new government, leaders of the Rada, and members of civil society. The Secretary will reaffirm the United States’ strong support for Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the right of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, without outside interference or provocation. Also, here’s a link to the full Nato statement issued earlier this evening in response to the situation in Ukraine. As Ukraine’s fledgling government in Kiev puts the country on a war footing and Russia tightens its grip on the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, here’s a piece by Guardian journalists covering the crisis from Brussels, New York and the Crimean city of Simferopol. As Kiev called for help from Washington and London, Ukraine’s acting prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said: This is actually a declaration of war on my country. We urge Putin to pull back his troops from this country and honour bilateral agreements. If he wants to be the president who started a war between two neighbouring and friendly countries, he has reached his target within a few inches. While Yatsenyuk was speaking, hundreds of Russian troops surrounded a Ukrainian base just outside the Crimean capital, Simferopol, in the latest military manoeuvre on the peninsula indicative of a move by Moscow to annex the peninsula in all but name. The Guardian saw crowds of Russian civilians gathering outside the base at Perevalnoye. Russian units have already secured the parliament building in Simferopol and two airports in Crimea in moves that have provoked the gravest crisis in post-Soviet areas since the 2008 Russian-Georgian war and have the potential to turn into Europe’s worst conflict since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. The rule of Ukraine’s new leaders will “end with a new revolution” amid more bloodshed, Russia’s Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev has predicted. In a Facebook post, he accused the new government in Kiev of “seizing power”, adding that while Viktor Yanukovich had practically no authority, he remained the legitimate head of state according the constitution. Medvedev said: If he is guilty before Ukraine - hold an impeachment procedure ... and try him. Everything else is lawlessness. The seizure of power, and that means such order will be extremely unstable. It will end in a new revolution. New blood. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has accepted a proposal by the German chancellor, Angel Merkel, to set up a “fact-finding mission” that would pave the way for some form of political dialogue in the crisis. That’s according to a spokesperson for the German government, who has been giving Germany’s account of a conversation earlier between the two leaders. The mission would possibly to be led by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Merkel is also said to have accused Putin of an “unacceptable Russian intervention” and of breaching international law. Medvedev also said that Viktor Yanukovych - who fled to Russia last week after being ousted as Ukraine’s president last week, although Yanukovych maintains that he was not “ousted” - is Ukraine’s legitimate head of state under the country’s constitution. That said, Medvedev added that Yanukovych’s authority is “practically non-existent”. This is coming through from the Russian Interfax new agency. Russia’s Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, says that Russia is ready to develop ties with Ukraine, “but not with those who seized power through bloodshed”. That’s according to a snap on Reuters. More to come no doubt. Are we looking at the prospect of a second Cold War? Yes, but probably not in the sense of previous decades, according to a former British foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. He told Channel 4 News earlier: This is not a Cold War that could lead to a Hot War. At that time it involved nuclear weapons. We are not remotely in that sort of territory. But what we are seeing is a defining moment in the relationships between Europe, the west as a whole and Russia. Diplomacy is what is being used at the moment to discourage Mr Putin but we need to come to a pretty clear idea in the next 24 hours as to what his intentions are. If he wants this to be de-escalated he needs to give a very clear signal of two things: that he recognises and acceps the territorial integrity of Ukraine and that the Russian troops are going to be withdrawn to Sevastopol If he doesn’t do that then you are going to see a very rapid deterioration of the substance of relationships between Russia and, not just the West, but China as well. Nato’s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has been speaking following an emergency Nato meeting on the crisis in Ukraine, saying that members of the alliance call on Russia to “de-escalate tensions”. He added: We call on Russia to honour all its international committments to withdraw its force to bases and to refrain from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine. Rasmussen also said that Nato members were urging “both parties” in the crisis to seek a peaceful resolution through dialogue and through the dispatch of observers under the auspieces of the UN Security Council or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Rasmussen went on to describe Ukraine as “a valued partner for Nato” and a founding member of ‘Partnership for Peace’ (Nato’s website describes the programme as one of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Euro-Atlantic partner countries and NATO). Perhaps crucially, the Nato secretary general added that Nato members were in support of Ukraine’s “territorial integrity” and the right of Ukraine’s people |to determine their own future without outside interference”. rasmuss None of the 44 countries taking part in the 11th Winter Paralympics, which open on Friday 7 March, have yet hinted at withdrawal, but a number are monitoring the situation, reports my colleague, Peter Walker. The Russian venue, which has just finished hosting the Winter Olympics, is less than 300 miles from Simferopol, Crimea’s administrative capital, although there are no immediate security fears for the 700 participating athletes. However, should the situation escalate significantly in the next few days, some Paralympic associations could come under political pressure to reconsider. A spokeswoman for the United States Olympic Committee, which also deals with Paralympic matters, said: Nothing has changed in our planning; we are looking forward to a great 2014 Paralympic Winter Games. On Saturday the International Paralympic Committee said it hoped to see Russia adhere to the Olympic truce, a tradition backed by a UN resolution that asks nations to cease hostilities during the Olympics and Paralympics. The concept of the Olympic truce, codified by a UN resolution in 1993, came in the wake of the tit-for-tat boycotts of Summer Olympics which badly affected the 1980 and 1984 Games. Britain’s Prime Minister, David Cameron, has instructed his ministers to not attend the Sochi Paralympics due to escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, while several national Paralympic associations are busy discussing whether their athletes should still take part. Following an announcement by the foreign secretary, William Hague, that the UK was withdrawing from preparatory talks for the G8 summit in the Olympic and Paralympic venue of Sochi, scheduled for June, Cameron tweeted: The head of of the Ukrainian Navy, who swore allegiance earlier today to the pro-Russian government of the Crimea region, has been dismissed and faces a treason investigation, according to a Ukrainian government official Deputy National Security Council Secretary Viktoria Siumar told journalists at a briefing that Admiral Denis Berezovsky had been fired and replaced by another officer. She said he had offered no resistance when his headquarters was surrounded and then transferred his allegiance to the regional parliament in Crimea. Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin has discussed Ukraine with the Germany Chancellor, Angela Merkel, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. He told her that measures taken by Russia have been “completely appropriate” given the situation in Ukrainem and that there had been a threat of violance from “ultra-nationalists”. According to the same report, Putin and Merkel agreed that Germany and Russia would continue with bilateral and multilateral consultions to bring about “normalisation” of the situation there. We have yet to hear any public response from Germany to confirm that account. In Brussels meanwhile, an emergency NATO meeting has been underway. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog. • Russian troops have surrounded at least two military bases in Crimea and approached others seeking to gain access or get hold or their weapons. There were reported to be about 150 Russian troops and more than 20 military vehicles outside the Perevalnoe base, where there was a tense standoff. Ukrainian soldiers drove a tank up to the inside gates of the base in response and around 15 of them lined up against the gate. • The Ukrainian prime minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, said Russia has declared war on Ukraine and that it is not just a threat from Moscow. He warned: “We are on the brink of disaster”. • The US secretary of state, John Kerry, warned that Russia could be expelled from the G8 and face economic sanctions, unless President Vladimir Putin halts his “incredible act of aggression”. He also mentioned visa bans, asset freezes and trade isolation as possible steps. • Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen accused Russia of threatening peace and security in Europe by its actions and of violating the UN charter. He called on Russia to “de-escalate”. • Britain and France joined the US in pulling out of preparatory meetings for the G8 economic summit, scheduled to be held in June at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, site of the just-concluded 2014 Winter Olympics. • Ukraine’s parliament has called for international monitors to help ensure the safety of its nuclear power plants. •There were demonstrations both for and against Russian intervention in Ukraine in Moscow. There were at least 10,000 people at the pro demonstration, according to AP, although reporters said some were ordered to be there. The anti demonstration was much smaller but saw at least 50 people detained by Russian police. The new commander of the Ukrainian navy, Denys Berezovsky, has “defected”, just one day after being appointed, it is being reported. Another Ukrainian base has been surrounded in Crimea. The Guardian’s Europe editor, Ian Traynor, raises the prospect of Vladimir Putin being “the new [Slobodan] Milosevic” in an article examining what will happen now in Ukraine. He writes: The most benign outcome is that Putin envisages a Georgia-style incursion, a brief week of creating new facts on the ground, limiting the campaign to taking control of the Crimean peninsula with its majority ethnic Russian population, and then negotiating and dictating terms from a position of strength to the weak and inexperienced new leadership in Kiev ... The aim, as Ukraine’s acting president speculated on Sunday, may be to wreck Ukraine economically; to disable its functioning as a genuinely independent state. That aim would encourage Putin to expand his influence from Crimea into eastern Ukraine, dismissing Kiev’s authority, broadly cutting the country in two, Kiev and the west versus the east and the south. That raises the prospect of civil war. Already, in the initial skirmishing, the tactics and the methodology that made Serbia’s Milosevic so ascendant in the Yugoslav wars of 1991-95 and Kosovo in 1998-99 (although he lost them all in the end) are evident ... If Putin opts to be the new Milosevic, the west will be staring a new division of Europe in the face. He adds that there “appears little appetite in the west for getting seriously embroiled beyond diplomacy”. There have been pro- and anti-war demonstrations in Moscow today, AP reports. It says at least 10,000 people bearing Russian flags marched through Moscow in support of an invasion of Ukraine. However, it appears some may have been there under orders. In Red Square, where there was an anti-invasion demonstration, at least 50 people were detained and at least five police vans, which carry between 15 and 20 protesters, drove away from the square, according to AP. Here are a few tweets on how Russian TV is covering events in Crimea. Russia Today’s depiction of an idyllic scene in the Crimea is not entirely convincing. Pro-Russian troops, filmed earlier in a standoff with a Ukrainian naval officer at a base in Sevastopol, reportedly left the base. These ships were built for the then-Soviet navy in the 1980s. Given Russia has a fleet there, it presumably is not particularly unusual. Ukraine is preparing to defend itself against Russia but will ask other countries for help if Russia expands its military activity, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations said today. Yuriy Sergeyev told CNN’s State of the Union: We are to demonstrate that we have our own capacity to protect ourselves as decided today in parliament and we are preparing to defend ourselves. If aggravation is going in that way, when the Russian troops are enlarging their quantity with every coming hour, naturally we will ask for military support and other kind of support. Sergeyev asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull back in observance of the Orthodox Church’s holy season of Lent, which starts on Monday. He said: If he demonstrates his Christianity, rather than preparing to kill us, he should pray for us. Here are some more quotes from that interview with John Kerry on CBS’s Face the Nation in which he warned Russia faced a number of possible sanctions if it did not pull back from Ukraine. It’s an incredible act of aggression. It is really a stunning, willful choice by President (Vladimir) Putin to invade another country. Russia is in violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine. Russia is in violation of its international obligations... There will be serious repercussions if this stands. The president ... told Mr Putin that it was imperative to find a different path, to roll back this invasion and un-do this act of invasion. He added that G8 nations and some other countries are “prepared to go to the hilt to isolate Russia” with a “broad array of options” available. They’re prepared to put sanctions in place, they’re prepared to isolate Russia economically, the ruble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges. He also mentioned visa bans, asset freezes and trade isolation as possible steps. We’re not trying to make this a battle between East and West, we’re not trying to make this a Cold War. Nobody wants this kind of action, there are many ways to resolve this kind of problem. If Russia wants to be a G8 country, it needs to behave like a G8 country, and I guarantee you that everybody is determined that if this cannot be resolved in a reasonable, modern, 21st Century manner, there are going to be repercussions. He said Putin’s actions were motivated by “weakness and out of a certain kind of desperation”. Ukraine and Russia are members of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as is the US. John Kerry made the comments about imposing sanctions on Russia on CBS’s Face the Nation programme. He condemned Russia’s “incredible act of aggression” in Ukraine, adding: You just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pre-text. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the current situation that is a statement that is a statement likely to be flung back at him given what happened in Iraq. Kerry added that Russia still has “a right set of choices” that can be made to defuse the crisis. Ukraine has withdrawn its coastguard vessels from the Crimean ports of Kerch and Sevastopol to Odessa and Mariupol, Reuters reports, describing it as “a sign that Russian forces were completing their seizure of the isolated Black Sea peninsula”. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has warned Russia of “very serious repercussions” from the US and the west, including sanctions that would “isolate Russia economically”, according to a Reuters newsflash. Confirming the UK’s withdrawal from preparatory meetings for the G8 summit in Sochi, the BBC reports foreign secretary William Hague as saying: The sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine has been violated and this cannot be the way to conduct international affairs. And so in addition to calling yesterday’s emergency meeting of the UN security council, the United Kingdom will join other G8 countries this week in suspending our cooperation under the G8 which Russia chairs. German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the situation in Ukraine is “extremely dangerous” and he urged Russia to desist transgressions of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said: It is urgently necessary that all those responsible desist from taking further steps that can only be seen as a provocation. Anything else would lead to an escalation with uncertain, possibly dramatic consequences. Steinmeier also said Russia had no right to deploy its military in Ukrainian sovereign territory beyond the rules of the treaty on the Russian Black Sea fleet. Britain has followed in the footsteps of the US by pulling out of preparatory talks due to be held in the coming days for the G8 summit in Sochi over Russia’s decision to take military action in Ukraine, the Press Association reports citing Foreign Office officials. France has also suspended its participation in the meetings according to a Reuters newsflash, citing a presidential source. The pope has urged world leaders to promote dialogue as a way of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. Speaking to thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square during his traditional Sunday midday appearance, he said: I am making a heartfelt appeal to the international community: support every initiative for dialogue and harmony. Francis urged all segments of Ukrainian society to work together to overcome their misunderstandings and build a future together. This video purports to show a standoff between pro-Russian troops and a Ukrainian officer in Sevastopol. Translations underneath suggest the Ukrainian is resisting attempts by the troops with their faces covered to seize the arsenal of weapons at the base. Shaun Walker is at the Perevalne military base in Crimea, where there is a tense standoff between opposing forces. He told me: It’s a Ukrainian base. There are Russian troops everywhere, lining the hills and roads towards it. There are at least 100 of them standing in twos and several military vehicles. The Ukrainians are inside. They have driven a tank up to the gates and there are 15 of them lined up by the gates. There was a negotiation and the Russians have agreed they’re not going to enter the base for now and the Ukrainians have said they’re not going to give up. Here is a quick summary of the latest developments • Russian and Ukrainian troops are engaged in a tense standoff at a military base in Crimea. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker said at least a hundred Russian troops are outside the Perevalnoe base, while the Ukrainians have driven a tank up to the inside gates of the base where 15 Ukrainian soldiers are lined up. • A Ukrainian MP told the Guardian Russian troops are trying to get soldiers to give up their weapons in three locations in Crimea. Kiev has denied Russian media claims that its troops are defecting. • Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen has accused Russia of threatening peace and security in Europe by its actions and of violating the UN charter. He called on Russia to “de-escalate”. • The Ukrainian prime minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, said Russia has declared war on Ukraine and that it is not just a threat from Moscow. He warned: “We are on the brink of disaster”. • Ukraine’s parliament has called for international monitors to help ensure the safety of its nuclear power plants. • French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said that planning for the G8 economic summit, scheduled to be held in June at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, site of the just-concluded 2014 Winter Olympics, should be put on hold. The US had already said it would suspend participation in “preparatory meetings”. Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has said Russia is threatening peace in Europe. He said in a statement: What Russia is doing now in Ukraine violates the principles of the United Nations charter. It threatens peace and security in Europe. Rasmussen called on Russia to deescalate tensions and for all parties to “continue all efforts to move away from this dangerous situation”. Oksana Grytsenko, reporting from the Guardian in Ukraine, has been speaking to a Ukrainian MP who said that Russian soldiers have been trying to get Ukrainian forces in Crimea to give up their weapons: Hrygory Nemyria, Batkivshchyna lawmaker, told journalists regarding Russian soldiers in Crimea: “In three locations they didn’t just block but came in. They suggested military personal give up arms.” He added that the same was happening with several police units. Parliament approved with more that 300 votes a resolution appealing to state guarantors of Ukraine’s security (UK and US) to involve and send monitoring missions here. Nemyria said: “They have Russian citizens in Ukraine’s provinces orchestrating illegal seizure of administrative buildings.”He added that Russians acted in Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv yesterday. There is a huge demonstration in Independence Square, Kiev, going on at present. Here is a live stream: Ukraine’s prime minister has warned that Russia is not merely threatening Ukraine. Shaun Walker sends this update from Crimea: I have just been at a press conference by Crimean parliament speaker Vladimir Konstantinov. I asked him if the referendum set for 30 March could include a question about joining Russia. He was evasive but appeared to say no. He also refused to say for certain whether he recognises the Ukrainian constitution. The prime minister of Georgia, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008 over the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, has said the international community “must use all efforts to ensure against the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Irakli Garibashvilli said in a statement: The decision of the Russian government to send additional troops to Ukraine is a clear violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and international law. This situation escalates the turbulent situation even further and may entail grievous consequences. The international community, especially the European Union and the United States of America, must use all efforts to ensure against the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community must respond immediately to these processes and compel Russia to give up its forceful actions. Otherwise, we many end up facing yet another wave of aggression and occupation, which Georgia has experienced firsthand. At a closed-door session, Ukraine’s parliament has called for international monitors to help ensure the safety of its nuclear power plants, Reuters reports. Hryhoriy Nemyria, a member of parliament, said the assembly appealed to the signatories of a 1994 nuclear treaty that guaranteed Ukraine’s safety - including the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia. Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, writes for Comment is Free that the crisis in Crimea could lead the world into a second cold war. This is perhaps the most dangerous point in Europe’s history since the end of the cold war. Direct confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian forces will draw in the United States, one way or another... The Crimea crisis will not pass soon. Kiev is unlikely to agree to Crimea’s secession, even if backed by clear popular will: this would be discounted because of the “foreign occupation” of the peninsula. The crisis is also expanding to include other players, notably the United States. So far, there has been no military confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian forces, but if they clash, this will not be a repeat of the five-day war in the South Caucasus, as in 2008. The conflict will be longer and bloodier, with security in Europe put at its highest risk in a quarter century. Even if there is no war, the Crimea crisis is likely to alter fundamentally relations between Russia and the west and lead to changes in the global power balance, with Russia now in open competition with the United States and the European Union in the new eastern Europe. If this happens, a second round of the cold war may ensue as a punishment for leaving many issues unsolved – such as Ukraine’s internal cohesion, the special position of Crimea, or the situation of Russian ethnics in the newly independent states; but, above all, leaving unresolved Russia’s integration within the Euro-Atlantic community. Russia will no doubt pay a high price for its apparent decision to “defend its own” and “put things right”, but others will have to pay their share, too. The Russian press are continuing to paint a picture of ethnic Russians under siege in Ukraine. Itar-Tass news agency, which describes itself as “the state central information agency”, reports that Russia’s border guard service said some 675,000 Ukrainians have left for Russia in January and February this year and warned that there are signs of a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Tass quotes the service as saying: If ‘revolutionary chaos’ in Ukraine continues, hundreds of thousands of refugees will flow into bordering Russian regions. Here are a couple of updates from Russian news organisations: Interfax is reporting that the conservative vice-speaker of Russia’s Duma, Sergei Zheleznyak, has called a rally today in support of “Ukrainian brothers” who continue to speak Russian and don’t recognise the “nationalist Bandera supporters who have seized power.” Members of Ukraine’s infamous Berkut riot police from all over the country are seeking Russian passports along with their families, the major of the Crimean Berkut detachment Viktor Denisenko told journalists, Ria Novosti reports. Previously, the Moscow police announced they would form a special unit from former members of Berkut, which had answered directly to President Viktor Yanukovych and was a main instrument of violence against protestors in Kiev but was disbanded last week, after the ousting of Yanukovych. A convoy of hundreds of Russian troops is headed toward the regional capital of Ukraine’s Crimea region, AP is reporting. On the road from Sevastopol, the Crimean port where Russia has its naval base, to Simferopol on Sunday morning, Associated Press journalists saw 12 military trucks carrying troops, a Tiger vehicle armed with a machine gun and also two ambulances. Ukraine is calling up all its military reserves, Reuters is reporting. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker sends this update from Ukraine: Andriy Kozhemyakin, influential lawmaker of Batkivshchyna and SBU [Ukrainian security service] general told me he has no information about the Russians invading military bases. He also denied that Russian troops were in regions outside Crimea. But a number of bases are blocked, he said: “Ukraine’s soldiers received order not to fight with Russians who are blocking or invading into military bases, and I think it’s right under current circumstances.” State funded news website Russia Today claims that Ukrainian troops sent to Crimea by the Kiev government are switching sides. Unsurprisingly, given RT’s links to the Russian government, many are crying “propaganda”. Earlier today , RT was hacked. Russian military servicemen have taken weapons from a radar base and naval training facility in Ukraine’s Crimea region and urged personnel to side with the peninsula’s “legitimate” leaders, Interfax news agency is reporting. From Reuters: It quoted a Ukrainian defence ministry source as saying the Russian servicemen had taken pistols, rifles and ammunition cartridges from the radar post near the town of Sudak and taken them away by car. Another group of Russian military had also removed weapons from a Ukrainian navy training centre in the port city of Sevastopol, where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet also has a base. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the latest events from Ukraine, where the country has put its armed forces on full alert and warned Russia that military intervention will lead to war. The move came shortly after Vladimir Putin gave the green light for an invasion as the upper house of the Russian parliament unanimously approved his request to send troops into the neighbouring state. Tensions continued to mount on Sunday with the Associated Press reporting that journalists on Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula have seen a convoy of hundreds of Russian troops heading toward the regional capital, Simferopol. Russian military servicemen are also reported to have taken weapons from a radar base and naval training facility in Ukraine’s Crimea region and urged personnel to side with the peninsula’s “legitimate” leaders, according to the Interfax news agency. Barack Obama accused Russia on Saturday of a “breach of international law” and condemned the country’s military intervention, calling it a “clear violation” of Ukrainian sovereignty during a 90-minute telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/30/nuclear-powers-weapons-spending-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-30T20:48:33Z","webTitle":"Nuclear powers plan weapons spending spree, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/30/nuclear-powers-weapons-spending-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/30/nuclear-powers-weapons-spending-report","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear powers plan weapons spending spree, report finds","bodyText":"The world's nuclear powers are planning to spend hundreds of billions of pounds modernising and upgrading weapons warheads and delivery systems over the next decade, according to an authoritative report published on Monday. Despite government budget pressures and international rhetoric about disarmament, evidence points to a new and dangerous \"era of nuclear weapons\", the report for the British American Security Information Council (Basic) warns. It says the US will spend $700bn (£434bn) on the nuclear weapons industry over the next decade, while Russia will spend at least $70bn on delivery systems alone. Other countries including China, India, Israel, France and Pakistan are expected to devote formidable sums on tactical and strategic missile systems. For several countries, including Russia, Pakistan, Israel and France, nuclear weapons are being assigned roles that go well beyond deterrence, says the report. In Russia and Pakistan, it warns, nuclear weapons are assigned \"war-fighting roles in military planning\". The report is the first in a series of papers for the Trident Commission, an independent cross-party initiative set up by Basic. Its leading members include former Conservative defence secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, former Liberal Democrat leader and defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell and former Labour defence secretary Lord Browne. There is a strong case, they say, for a fundamental review of UK nuclear weapons policy. The Conservatives in Britain's coalition government say they want to maintain a Trident-based nuclear weapons system. However, they have agreed to a \"value for money\" audit into a Trident replacement as four new nuclear missiles submarines are alone estimated to cost £25bn at the latest official estimate. The Lib Dems want to look at other options. The paper, by security analyst Ian Kearns, is entitled Beyond the United Kingdom: Trends in the Other Nuclear Armed States. Pakistan and India, it warns, appear to be seeking smaller, lighter nuclear warheads so they have a greater range or can be deployed over shorter distances for tactical or \"non-strategic\" roles. \"In the case of Israel, the size of its nuclear-tipped cruise missile enabled submarine fleet is being increased and the country seems to be on course, on the back of its satellite launch rocket programme, for future development of an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM),\" the report notes. A common justification for the new nuclear weapons programmes is perceived vulnerability in the face of nuclear and conventional force development elsewhere. For example, Russia has expressed concern over the US missile defence and Conventional Prompt Global Strike programmes. China has expressed similar concerns about the US as well as India, while India's programmes are driven by fear of China and Pakistan. Pakistan justifies its nuclear weapons programme by referring to India's conventional force superiority, the report observes. In a country-by-country analysis, the report says: • The US is planning to spend $700bn on nuclear weapons over the next decade. A further $92bn will be spent on new nuclear warheads and the US also plans to build 12 nuclear ballistic missile submarines, air-launched nuclear cruise missiles and bombs. • Russia plans to spend $70bn on improving its strategic nuclear triad (land, sea and air delivery systems) by 2020. It is introducing mobile ICBMs with multiple warheads, and a new generation of nuclear weapons submarines to carry cruise as well as ballistic missiles. There are reports that Russia is also planning a nuclear-capable short-range missile for 10 army brigades over the next decade. • China is rapidly building up its medium and long-range \"road mobile\" missile arsenal equipped with multiple warheads. Up to five submarines are under construction capable of launching 36-60 sea-launched ballistic missiles, which could provide a continuous at-sea capability. • France has just completed deployment of four new submarines equipped with longer-range missiles with a \"more robust warhead\". It is also modernising its nuclear bomber fleet. • Pakistan is extending the range of its Shaheen II missiles, developing nuclear cruise missiles, improving its nuclear weapons design as well as smaller, lighter, warheads. It is also building new plutonium production reactors. • India is developing new versions of its Agni land-based missiles sufficient to target the whole of Pakistan and large parts of China, including Beijing. It has developed a nuclear ship-launched cruise missile and plans to build five submarines carrying ballistic nuclear missiles. • Israel is extending its Jericho III missile's range, and is developing an ICBM capability, expanding its nuclear-tipped cruise missile enabled submarine fleet. • North Korea unveiled a new Musudan missile in 2010 with a range of up to 2,500 miles and capable of reaching targets in Japan. It successfully tested the Taepodong-2 with a possible range of more than 6,000 miles sufficient to hit half the US mainland. However, the report, says, \"it is unclear whether North Korea has yet developed the capability to manufacture nuclear warheads small enough to sit on top of these missiles\". Iran's nuclear aspirations are not covered by the report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/26/renewable-energy-rwe-drops-uk-turbine-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-26T00:43:00Z","webTitle":"Energy firm RWE npower axes £4bn UK windfarm amid political uncertainty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/26/renewable-energy-rwe-drops-uk-turbine-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/26/renewable-energy-rwe-drops-uk-turbine-project","fields":{"headline":"Energy firm RWE npower axes £4bn UK windfarm amid political uncertainty","bodyText":"Britain's green ambitions have been dealt a blow as a big six energy company has pulled the plug on one of the world's largest offshore windfarms, with the political storm enveloping the industry threatening the multibillion-pound investments needed to meet emissions targets and head off a looming capacity crunch. Weeks after warning that the government was treating environmental subsidies as a \"political football\", the German-owned RWE npower is pulling out of the £4bn Atlantic Array project in the Bristol Channel because the economics do not stack up. The move comes as figures show that energy firms reaped a 77% increase in profits per customer last year, due to bill increases that the big six say are partly due to government green levies. The shelving of the Atlantic Array is a setback for the government, which is banking on bigger windfarms in deeper waters to help provide low-carbon power. The RWE cancellation is the first axing of a Round 3 windfarm – schemes such as those in Dogger Bank, Hornsea and East Anglia, which are supposed to help the government meet a target of generating 15% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. It will also raise further concerns about investors being frightened away by political rows and policy uncertainty. The Renewable Energy Association (REA), which lobbies for more low-carbon power, said government infighting over subsidies was causing deep uncertainty in the industry. Ahead of next week's autumn statement, the chancellor is looking to transfer the £1.6bn cost of the energy companies obligation (Eco) and the smaller warm home discount to the taxpayer, removing the burden from household bills. \"We need assurances from George Osborne in the autumn statement about where we stand,\" said a spokesman for the REA. \"Nick Clegg says one thing about the green levies, Michael Fallon [the energy minister] another.\" Last week David Cameron was reported to have talked about the need to get rid of \"green crap\" from energy bills. Number 10 said it did not recognise the phrase but did not deny the sentiment. Peter Atherton, a leading energy analyst, warned last week that investment in power generation was \"killed stone dead\" until the next election by Ed Miliband's call for a price freeze and government delays in introducing promised electricity market reform. The political and public environment for power companies is set to become more hostile following the publication of figures on Monday showing that the average profit per customer for the big six rose from £30 to £53 last year. The industry watchdog said the rise was due to higher bills and increased energy use during a harsh winter, not due to cost reduction. RWE indicated that the government might have to raise green subsidies – and thus increase bills or the burden on the taxpayer – after admitting that technical difficulties had pushed the price up so far that it could not be justified under the current subsidy regime. \"This is not a decision we have taken lightly; however, given the technological challenges and market conditions, now is not the right time for RWE to continue to progress with this project,\" said Paul Cowling, director of offshore wind at RWE Innogy. The Atlantic Array would have provided clean energy for almost 1m homes and provided thousands of jobs in the construction phase. Cowling insisted RWE remained committed to offshore wind and would be proceeding with a range of other projects off the coast of Britain. Richard Sandford, head of European projects offshore at RWE, also denied that the Atlantic Array was dropped in a bid to save money at the German-based company. \"This really is project-specific and not at all down to other considerations. We are still proceeding with schemes like Galloper and Triton Knoll, off the east coast of the country.\" But RWE has already pulled out of a £350m nuclear-power project, is selling its DEA North Sea oil business and last week disposed of part of its UK gas and electricity supply arm. Developers have been warning for some time that they would need more subsidies from the government if ministers were to realise low-carbon energy targets. The demise of the 240-turbine Atlantic Array will be welcomed by Geoffrey Cox, the local Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon, who has been campaigning against the scheme. He and his supporters believe the project for 220-metre high turbines is unsightly. The plans to build it nine miles off the coast in the Bristol Channel were also rejected by North Devon council in September. But the pullout will also raise concerns about the investment landscape in Britain for energy companies such as RWE, which have been under ferocious attack by politicians, regulator and the public. The Crown Estate warned at the weekend that some Round 3 schemes might never see the light of day and insisted this was to be expected. Huub den Rooijen, the Crown Estate's head of offshore wind, said on Mondaythere would be further \"attrition\" to come. \"Paradoxically, this is a positive development because it provides greater clarity to key stakeholders such as supply chain and consenting bodies, and brings greater focus to the investment opportunities.\" The Crown Estate, which has control over most of the seabed around the UK, has just given the go-ahead to Statoil to experiment with a floating windfarm off the coast of Scotland. The Hywind scheme is seen as important because it could help reduce costs offshore. Renewable energy companies have promised to try to reduce offshore wind costs by 30% through a raft of measures as government ministers are under pressure to reduce public subsidies. RWE has declined to put a cost on developing the Atlantic Array but said it was more expensive than the Gwynt y Môr project off Wales, which will cost £2bn and is about half the size. The Departtment of Energy and Climate Change said: The decision not to proceed with the development is a matter for RWE. It was made on purely technical grounds and reflects the many complex challenges of constructing offshore windfarms. \"The UK still expects to deploy significant amounts of offshore wind by 2020 and we remain well placed to meet our 2020 renewable energy target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/mar/01/ukip-other-policies-bike-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-01T11:08:06Z","webTitle":"Ukip's other policies, from bike tax discs to aircraft carriers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/01/ukip-other-policies-bike-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/mar/01/ukip-other-policies-bike-taxes","fields":{"headline":"Ukip's other policies, from bike tax discs to aircraft carriers","bodyText":"Much as the Good Friday peace agreement saw Northern Ireland's once single-focus sectarian parties scramble to pull together policies on the likes of bus services and waste disposal, so is Ukip's second place in the Eastleigh byelection likely to bring increased scrutiny of its views beyond the two key messages on Europe and immigration. Delve into the policy documents on Ukip's website and two things emerge most clearly. Firstly, while it is perhaps unfair to label them 1950s revivalists, there is a distinctly nostalgic tone to many ideas: grammar schools, respect for the police, a strong Royal Navy, regular references to ending \"political correctness\" and multiculturalism. Also, Ukip has the minor party's luxury of promising to lavish money on projects while being somewhat vague on where this cash will be found. For an officially free-market party, Ukip made a perhaps surprising number of significant state spending commitments in its last full policy document, the 2010 election manifesto: • Defence spending would rise by 40%, with the navy getting more than 70 new ships, including three aircraft carriers. • The number of prison places would be doubled, with £30bn committed to flood defences and an unquantified further amount going to transport investment, including high-speed rail lines, more roads and improved ports and airports. • Almost £90bn would be committed to a mass programme of building nuclear power stations. The spending seemingly relies upon presumed savings from leaving the EU, which – the manifesto estimates, without giving a source – could total £120bn a year. There are similarly woolly promises about economies from cutting red tape and \"non-jobs\". Tax plans are more predictably new right, with a proposed flat combined income tax and national insurance rate of 31% for any annual income above £11,500. One of the party's more controversial views is its position on energy and climate change. Ukip is avowedly sceptical about human-caused climate change, claiming that \"more and more scientists are challenging the conventional wisdom on global warming\". Ukip's solution would be a radical rollback of renewable energy projects, such as wind farms, in favour of nuclear power and the likes of shale gas. While much of this combines into a relatively coherent message, some policy details can look contradictory or even a bit crankish, perhaps the result of one or a few activists imposing their personal opinions on a still relatively tiny party. Education is a case in point. While schools policy is a fairly straightforward mix of free market and nostalgia – parents would get vouchers to spend in the private or state sector, with the latter seeing the launch of new grammar schools and a focus on the three Rs – the position on universities seems a bit more anomalous. Ukip is scathing about the \"nonsensical target\" of having 50% of people attending university, arguing for example that nurses need vocational training rather than degrees. Yet the party also wants a return to state grants for students rather than loans. As some education websites note, how do you reduce university access while simultaneously making it a more attractive option? By a very non-free market cap on places, perhaps? Other details look fraught with unforeseen difficulties, or somewhat niche. The foreign affairs commitment to formally back independence for Taiwan has its arguments but would risk losing the UK very significant amounts of trade from an irate China. The separate policy document on animal welfare is perhaps laudable, but the public is maybe not at the stage where it needs a long list of specific Ukip promises about breeding pedigree dogs. Cyclists who voted Ukip in Eastleigh meanwhile, might be alarmed to learn the party believes bicycles should have tax discs, while riders should pay for parking and walk their bikes across busy roundabouts to prevent \"unacceptable delays to traffic\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/17/liberal-democrats-fewer-trident-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-17T13:08:23Z","webTitle":"Leadership sees off conference rebels' call to axe Trident nuclear missiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/17/liberal-democrats-fewer-trident-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/17/liberal-democrats-fewer-trident-submarines","fields":{"headline":"Leadership sees off conference rebels' call to axe Trident nuclear missiles","bodyText":"Liberal Democrats have voted to reduce rather than scrap Britain's Trident nuclear submarines in another significant victory for Nick Clegg. In a move described by the leadership as \"credible and deliverable\", party members backed a plan to give up at least one of the UK's four submarines in a vote at the Lib Dem conference. The leadership had feared a revolt as rebel activists were calling for the party to \"eliminate entirely the UK's nuclear deterrent as soon as practicable\". A group of grassroots Lib Dems, some with a long history of campaigning for nuclear disarmament, argued the party had caved in to Tory arguments for maintaining a deterrent. But the delegates appeared to have been won round by Sir Nick Harvey, a former defence minister, who said the proposal for reducing Britain's submarines should be characterised as the \"boldest and most radical suggestion to come from any of the [major] nuclear powers\". Harvey said the reduced fleet would mean no more sea patrols by nuclear submarines. This would send out a clear message that Britain does not need to be able to \"flatten Moscow\" at a moment's notice, or want to \"continue to sail the high seas waving weapons of mass destruction at no one in particular\", he said. Arguing that atomic weapons should be reduced gradually, he presented the plan as a \"practical proposition\" that was a clear precursor to further disarmament. Eventually, he said, this would allow Britain to \"beat a path to the nuclear exit door\". Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary, also argued that a partial replacement of the multibillion-pound Trident programme was a \"credible and deliverable\" first step towards nuclear disarmament. \"It's a change that is taken seriously in the United States,\" he said. \"They recognise that this is, within the UK context, a significant step that the UK can make on the journey that President Obama is talking about towards a world free of nuclear weapons. This is a major step in the ladder of disarmament, if you like, that we can take in the UK.\" His remarks suggest the Lib Dems are realistically hoping to get their plan implemented in a future coalition. This would be more likely in any alliance with Labour as the Conservatives have made it clear they would not accept such a compromise. Among the other senior Lib Dem figures to back the plan were Simon Hughes, the party's deputy leader, who urged members not to vote to abandon all nuclear weapons \"in one go\". Opponents were led by activist George Potter, who quoted the former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown saying the UK's nuclear deterrent is \"a monstrous folly\". \"It is only necessary for us to have an independent nuclear deterrent if three criteria are met,\" he said. \"One, that there is a country out there which is nuclear armed; two, that a country actively wishes to destroy the UK with nuclear weapons and no-one else; and three, that country will be deterred by us having an independent nuclear deterrent. This motion is a good motion but on Trident it calls for something I consider foolish and dangerous.\" A series of speakers supported his call for swift disarmament, including Paul Coleshill, leader of the Liberal Democrats in Glasgow, who compared Trident to a sports car inherited by a middle-aged man \"of failing prowess\". The rebel amendment was defeated by 322 votes to 228, meaning Clegg has now seen off several challenges to his policies. Over the past few days, he has won backing for his commitment to austerity, the continuation of the 45p tax rate, new nuclear power plants and the current system of charging university tuition fees. Following the nuclear debate, Alexander also unveiled plans to crack down on tax avoidance. He said the Treasury would close a loophole exploited by partnerships and launch a campaign to persuade landlords to pay the outstanding tax they own to HM Customs and Revenue. Alexander was well-received as he criticised Tories for presenting the EU as a \"bogeyman responsible for every wrong\". However, the biggest cheer of the day went to Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, who said the party was willing to be unpopular for expressing pro-European views. Kennedy blamed Tony Blair for Britain's predicament in Europe, saying he ran scared of the press and Gordon Brown – implying both were a barrier to Britain joining the single currency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-plant-fukushima","type":"gallery","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T17:46:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear power plant emergency – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-plant-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-plant-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear power plant emergency – in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/apr/11/lydd-airport-permission-increase-capacity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-11T17:47:00Z","webTitle":"Lydd airport given permission to increase capacity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/11/lydd-airport-permission-increase-capacity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/11/lydd-airport-permission-increase-capacity","fields":{"headline":"Lydd airport given permission to increase capacity","bodyText":"Environmental groups including the RSPB and the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) are considering legal action to challenge the government's decision to allow the expansion of Lydd airport in Kent. The minor airfield, wedged between Dungeness nuclear power station, Romney Marsh and a nature reserve, has been given permission to extend its runway and handle up to 500,000 passengers a year. The plan was approved by Eric Pickles, the communities and local government secretary, and Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, following a protracted dispute over an application first submitted in 2006. The growth of London Ashford airport, as it is formally known, is designed to ease air congestion in the south-east and create local jobs. But the decision is fiercely opposed by environmental activists, who fear it will destroy the tranquillity of the Kent coast and a nearby bird sanctuary. The RSPB and the CPRE are examining the 365-page report to see whether they can seek a judicial review in the high court. The airfield has been owned by a Saudi businessman, Sheikh Fahad al-Athel, since 2001. As a director of the Al Bilad company, Athel came to attention for his role as a fixer for Saudi Arabia's multibillion-pound Al Yamamah arms deal. Lydd opened in 1956 and at the height of its success Silver City airways, Dan-Air and other firms were carrying 250,000 people a year. Business collapsed in the 1970s. Shepway district council voted in favour of the expansion plan in 2010 but the scheme was called in by central government for assessment because of its national importance. Its approval allows the construction of a runway extension that can take Boeing 737 charter flights, and a new terminal building. Opponents, who fear passenger numbers will eventually increase to two million a year, have six weeks to appeal against the decision. The RSPB's conservation director, Martin Harper, said: \"This is the wrong decision as it opens the door to real damage to Dungeness, to its wildlife and the quality of life for many of its residents and risks destroying a unique asset that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people. \"Dungeness is a special place for nature, which is recognised globally for the importance of its wildlife. This decision means nowhere is safe and signals that nature is in trouble in the face of unfettered growth – these are worrying times for all who care for Britain's wildlife. We will be taking time to review the detail of the decision – and to plan our next steps.\" Neil Sinden, policy and campaigns director at the CPRE, said: \"This is a terrible decision which threatens one of the few remaining areas of rural tranquillity in heavily pressured south-east, and in a county once proudly described as the Garden of England. And it will not just alarm environmentalists. \"There were many in the aviation sector who considered this scheme to be nonsensical and a non-starter. If there are any economic benefits, which is unlikely, they will be heavily outweighed by the environmental damage that it will cause on so many levels. Campaigners are bound to consider all legal options to have this disturbing decision overturned.\" Keith Taylor, the Green party MEP for the south-east, said: \"The expansion also brings with it a serious nuclear safety issue that the government seems to have ignored. This government decision is bad for wildlife, potentially dangerous for local people and a step in the wrong direction in fighting climate change.\" Hani Mutlaq, Lydd airport's executive manager, said he was delighted with the go-ahead. \"I'm very pleased,\" he told the Guardian. \"I hope construction will start this year. At the moment we only have scheduled flights to Le Touquet in France but with a longer runway we will have the capacity for 737s that can reach destinations across Europe.\" Richard Griffiths, the planning lawyer who led the team advising the airport's owner, said: \"This is a significant decision from the government given the crossroads which aviation policy currently faces. [It] is perhaps an indication of the government's support for aviation expansion where the environmental impacts are demonstrated to be acceptable. \"Clearly the government has accepted that there is a need to grow capacity in the country's airports. However, whilst this is an important decision for both the aviation industry and also for infrastructure investment in Kent, questions should be asked why it has taken over six years to make a decision on these proposals.\" The decision states: \"After careful consideration, [the secretaries of state] are satisfied that there would be no likely significant effects on any designated conversation sites and also that the proposals would not have a significant effect on nuclear safety, landscape or tranquillity.\" Environmental activists claimed the proximity of Dungeness nuclear power station posed a severe risk if there was an air accident. In a local referendum, residents rejected the expansion scheme by a ratio of two to one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-08T12:26:33Z","webTitle":"Richard Branson pledges to turn Caribbean green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Richard Branson pledges to turn Caribbean green","bodyText":"The palm trees and billiard table have been shipped in, work on the infinity pool overlooking the coral reef is progressing and the tennis courts are celebrity-ready. But few of the super-luxury buildings rising on Moskito island's beaches are finished yet. Moskito is Sir Richard Branson's number two Caribbean island, but it will soon be his new family complex. It is just over a mile from Necker island, which he bought in his 20s for £250,000 and now rents for £40,000 a night. Both islands are eco-trophies for Britain's best-known entrepreneur, but his plans to ditch the use of diesel power and to generate electricity from wind and solar are expected to have a profound impact on dozens of far poorer nearby islands facing crippling debt, hurricanes and climate change. Last week Branson hosted a summit of financiers, politicians, energy companies, lawyers and others on Moskito and Necker to work up a plan to \"green\" the Caribbean, island by island. Five prime ministers and 12 governments, as well as international bankers and investors, heard renewable energy experts explain how the region's islands, which currently generate nearly all their electricity from diesel, could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year and reduce emissions by 50% or more. Necker and Moskito will be 75-80% converted to use renewable energy and become working models for how other islands could cut expensive diesel imports, while all Caribbean governments will be offered a technical and financial blueprint on how to switch, by US energy thinktank the Rocky Mountain Institute and Branson's green business group, Carbon War Room. So far the governments of Aruba, St Lucia, the British Virgin Islands, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, the Turks and Caicos, Dominica and the Colombian islands of Providencia and San Andrés have said that they will aim to increase their use of renewable energy and cut diesel imports. Last week the US government's private-sector lending arm said it would support the efforts by the islands to go green by offering loans of up to $250m for renewable energy and energy-saving projects. \"This is personal and global. Moskito is now our family home. We know that islands will suffer the most from climate change and sea-level rise. Reefs will be devastated, and wildlife decimated,\" Branson told the Observer in an interview. \"It's realistic to think that whole islands could be 75-80% clean energy in four to five years. It might not make sense to do the last 25%, but they all ought to be able to go 75-80% using wind and solar energy. \"Governments [here] need help. I think a lot of ministers may be new to the job; they can't be experts at climate or energy. Some need a helping hand to make the transition to renewables. We can really save families 40% of what they have to pay for electricity,\" he said. The irony of a man whose rail and airline companies are significant climate polluters trying to \"green\" small island states is not lost on Caribbean governments. Branson said it has led him to invest heavily in green fuels, solar panels and other \"clean-tech\" developments. \"There is no question that Virgin is involved in a number of businesses that emit a lot of carbon, and that is one of the reasons why I have to work particularly hard … but, more importantly, to try to help other people balance their books as well,\" he said. However, he said he has lost many millions of pounds in failed green investments. \"We have invested hundreds of millions in clean technology projects. We haven't made hundreds of millions profit. \"We had to write off a $50m investment in [US solar panel manufacturer] Solyndra in 2011. We went in with the best of intentions. The thing was that the price of solar had collapsed in China. So from a global perspective it could be said to be positive. We got in quite early. Pioneers can always come a cropper, like Freddie Laker. They often pave the way for others. But we are still standing, and investing.\" Branson's investments in cleaner aviation fuel continue, but are nowhere near ready to scale up for commercial use. Peak oil – the expected point of maximum global oil production before it starts to decline – and a widely predicted hike in fuel prices have not happened and, if anything, he said, the world should expect the oil price to fall rather than rise in the next few years because of fracking. Branson said he has high hopes for LanzaTech, a company that has pioneered a way to turn carbon-rich waste gases from aluminium producers and other industrial plants into biofuels. According to Virgin Atlantic, the fuel has the potential to cut aviation emissions by 60% compared with conventional fuels and could produce enough biofuel to meet 19% of global demand for aviation fuel. \"We still need a clean aviation fuel, though. It will take a while longer. But we know it works,\" he said. British author Tom Bower calculated in his new book, Branson, Behind the Mask, that the entrepreneur had lost $300m in failed green investments and used the British Virgin Islands to hide his accounts in a succession of 11 companies. \"He, most unusually, invested his own money and has lost most of it; and all his claims have proved to be wrong – namely: peak oil, oil prices, Virgin's use of alternative fuels and the potential profits,\" Bower said. The author accused Branson of not understanding the science or human costs of biofuels, and latching on to green businesses for political motives and profit, rather than for environmental reasons. \"He embraced environmentalism and aligned himself with Clinton and Gore, to get on the top table of US and British politics,\" said Bower. Branson shrugs off the criticisms, saying he has been an active environmentalist since his student hippy days and that, rather than him using the environment to get to politicians, it is more a case of politicians using him. Tony Blair, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and other politicians have visited Necker, but not David Cameron, whom Branson strongly supports for his commitment to nuclear power. \"I would say he is doing his best. I think they are trying to meet [emission] targets. Cameron has been brave with nuclear, from a global point of view. Germany backtracking on nuclear is worrying. Nuclear has got safer and safer; we can now use waste products of nuclear,\" he said. \"If you accept that the globe has a major problem [with emissions], then you can't leave nuclear out of the equation. I have studied how many people have been killed in nuclear accidents – it's less than 1,000. \"One Chinese coalmine disaster can kill more than that. If you have a global catastrophe, you have to take extreme measures. Nuclear seems to be an important weapon that the world has.\" More controversially, along with billionaires such as Bill Gates, Branson supports the idea of high-risk, quick technological fixes to \"geo-engineer\" the global climate if emissions were to get out of control. This could involve sucking carbon out of the air or spraying millions of tonnes of reflective particles of sulphur dioxide 30 miles above the Earth to cool it. \"I call it re-engineering,\" he said. \"There's a subtle difference, trying to re-engineer the world back to roughly where it is today. It's controversial, but we would be mad not to look at the technologies. If there are any risks attached, it would need the UN to decide whether the risk is worth taking … hopefully it won't be necessary. Hopefully we can come up with something more mundane than the radical answer.\" Branson said the environment is now his overriding preoccupation. He is seeking to set up a Caribbean-wide marine zone where no sharks are killed, and has lobbied heavily for a marine park around Australia. He is also involved in protecting wildlife in Africa. \"I find it interests me a lot more than making a few more bucks; it's much more satisfactory. I enjoyed building companies, but I find this more rewarding.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/23/energy-nuclear-power-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-23T07:15:00Z","webTitle":"Busting the carbon and cost myths of Germany's nuclear exit | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/23/energy-nuclear-power-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/23/energy-nuclear-power-germany","fields":{"headline":"Busting the carbon and cost myths of Germany's nuclear exit","bodyText":"With the UK taking another step towards supporting new nuclear power on Tuesday – at either no extra cost to the consumer if you believe ministers, or substantial cost if you believe most others – it's worth taking a look at what actually happens when you phase out nuclear power in a large, industrial nation. That is what Germany chose to do after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, closing eight plants immediately – 7GW - and another nine by 2022. The shrillest critics predicted blackouts, which was always daft and did not happen. But more serious critics worried that the three things at the heart of the energy and climate change debate - carbon, cost and security of supply – would all head in the wrong direction. Here in Berlin, I have found they were wrong on every count. On security of supply, critics predicted that Germany would have to import energy to make up that lost by the closure of the nuclear plants. It's an important issue for a nation that imports 70% of its energy. But what actually happened is that Germany simply exported less in 2011: 7TWh instead of 70TWh. \"We are still a net exporter,\" says Franzjosef Schafhausen, a senior civil servant. This was helped by a large decrease in energy consumption of 5.3% in 2011, delivered by big increases in energy efficiency in buildings, homes and industry, as well as in part a milder winter. Aha, I hear you say, but Germany's economy must have shrunk as well: it grew by 3%, in rather stark contrast to double-dip Britain. Cutting energy use naturally cuts the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change, as did the increased deployment of renewable energy. In 2011, Germany's emissions fell by 2%, confounding those who predicted a rise if nuclear was replaced by coal. Some was, but 60% of the lost nuclear capacity was replaced by renewable energy in a single year. And remember, even if carbon emissions had risen a little in Germany, the total emissions in Europe – capped by the emissions trading scheme – would remain the same. Germany also remains well on track for its 40% emissions cut by 2020. If security of supply and carbon emissions did not suffer as the reactors cooled, surely the cost of electricity must have gone up? And it did, with wholesale spot prices rising 10-15% in the weeks following the Fukushima catastrophe. But a year on, they are now below pre-Fukushima prices by about 10-15%. That is due to fast increasing renewables – now 20% of electricity supply - which cut peak costs. Bärbel Höhn, a Green party MP and former state environment minister, says Germany industry now has lower power prices than the UK, France, Spain and Italy. Schafhausen remains realistic about the future: \"There is no doubt that the power price to the consumer will increase, but we will implement our energy transformation step-by-step and therefore have only a small increase.\" Germany had been planning its nuclear exit since 2002 and is now showing it can be done without hitches. In the UK, the possibility of no nuclear power is not even on the government's table. But with big utilities one by one turning their backs on UK atomic energy, the question is can a forced exit be done without harming cost, carbon and security of supply?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/01/nuclear-power-british-government-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-01T10:39:00Z","webTitle":"Collusion over nuclear power mirrors the PR disaster of GM crops | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/01/nuclear-power-british-government-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/01/nuclear-power-british-government-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Collusion over nuclear power mirrors the PR disaster of GM crops","bodyText":"For the British government to attempt to \"maintain public confidence among the British public on the safety of nuclear power stations\" by colluding in secret with the nuclear industry within just 48 hours of the Fukushima disaster would be laughable if it were not so serious. It was, at best, only a partial success. This opinion poll from Ipsos-Mori shows that one in five of those Britons now opposed to nuclear power had not been opposed prior to the catastrophe in Japan (see graph). Across the globe, the poll found two-thirds of the public opposed to nuclear power. (There's more on that in my previous post.) In countries where people are strongly opposed to nuclear power, such as Germany (79% against) and Italy (81%), politicians listened to their electorates and ended their nuclear ambitions. Germany says it will look to a future of renewable energy and with their record of economic success, who would bet against them? In the UK right now, the public is split 50-50 between supporting and opposing nuclear power, and a majority - 57% - think new reactors should not be built. The problem is that the machinery of government, and the ministers it serves, is 100% behind the plans of the nuclear industry, as the Guardian revealed today. In contrast, the poll showed huge public support across the world for solar power (97% in favour), wind power (93%) and hydroelectricity (91%). To my mind, it resembles the public relations fiasco of the first genetically modified crops in the UK, which doomed commercial use of the technology for two decades. As it happens, I have no objections to the technology, only grasping business models that can be used to deploy it. But by attempting to drive through a novel technology without regard to consumer attitudes, the GM industry scored a stunning own goal. So why is the British government so determined to drive through a technology, nuclear, that has far less support than wind and solar power, and is very likely to use up vast sums of money that would be far better spent on creating a world-beating renewables industry? The debate on nuclear power is a complex one and regulation and safety is just one of at least five major issues that need to be considered, as I have written before. The capture of the UK government by the nuclear industry, as has also happened in the US and in Japan, strengthens the case against nuclear power on one of those five issues. Balancing them all, I still think nuclear power cannot be the answer to the UK's search for low-carbon energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/13/lib-dem-conference-nick-clegg","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-13T19:27:14Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem conference: words set to override action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/13/lib-dem-conference-nick-clegg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/13/lib-dem-conference-nick-clegg","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem conference: words set to override action","bodyText":"Three out of four voters will not consider the Liberal Democrats at the next election, party officials conceded on Friday. But the officials insist the party has the potential to rise from its 10% standing in the polls by doing more to clarify its differences with the Tories, by highlighting the inadequacy of Labour and by seeking credit for staying the course on the economy. But the Lib Dems' conference, which starts on Saturday in Glasgow, may be marked by a series of internal disputes as the leadership and party activists wrestle over strategy, policies and the independence of its manifesto. The leader, Nick Clegg, will try to make a virtue of the party's willingness to debate its differences in the open, and to do so \"in a spirit of honesty and respect\". In a speech on Saturday he will say: \"People who don't understand us like to call debate division. I think it's debates that give us our unity.\" Clegg will stress he is not seeking to railroad the party. \"I'm just the latest in a long line of party leaders to know that when it comes down to it I have one vote in the conference hall, just like the rest of you,\" he will say. But his remarks underlie a nervousness about whether some in the rank and file of the party will vent their fears that Clegg and some of his entourage are too eager to form a second coalition with the Conservatives after the 2015 election. On the economy, the Lib Dem leadership had agreed a lengthy motion – due to be debated on Monday – seeking to reflect a consensus, and taking in the views of the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander. Clegg, unusually, has signalled he will intervene in the debate. Since then, amendments have been tabled by the Social Liberal Forum (SLF), an internal pressure group, which have gathered the support of 100 signatories, calling for a dramatic increase in housebuilding and specifically blaming the Treasury for taking too conservative a view on the rights of local councils to borrow to build more homes. SLF also suggests the party needs to adopt its own stance on the fiscal mandate after 2015, and not be bound by any joint decisions with the Tories. One of the prime movers of the amendments, SLF co-chair Gareth Epps, argues that \"if Clegg does not accept the amendment, the Liberal Democrats will not be going into the next election with an independent economic policy\". Some columnists have billed the debate on the economy as a High Noon for the leadership. Peter Oborne in the Telegraph wrote: \"If the leadership does lose such a vital vote, Mr Clegg will suffer a grave and probably irreparable loss of authority.\" Cable takes a more relaxed view of the debate, saying that – apart from a section in one amendment about the powers of the Bank of England – he has little problem with the changes. \"Some of the stuff is perfectly good, such as on housing and indeed the idea that as an independent party we are going to have to have a different approach to the economy during the election. That is all good stuff. \"What is then the argument? I am not an expert on conference procedure but there is this ancient art of compositing where people gather together the good elements in competing motions and we proceed. \"I would be surprised if there is a big bust-up, maybe not even a vote. I don't know enough about procedure to judge it. But I would think intelligent people can reconcile these approaches.\" On Monday the conference will also debate the future of the so-called bedroom tax and whether the party should back a return of the 50% top rate of tax, a switch supported by the party president, Tim Farron. Later in the week it will debate whether to abandon opposition to a nuclear deterrent in favour of the more nuanced position, presented by Alexander, which called for a credible alternative to Trident but without continuous at-sea deterrence or the planned four submarines. The party's stance on Syria and the conditions for any military action looks certain to reach the conference floor. In addition fracking, subsidies for nuclear power, the retention of tuition fees and controlling pornography on the internet all have the capacity to divide opinion. In an era where the main party conferences are stage-managed to tedium, the Lib Dems at least deserve credit for keeping the spirit of democratic debate alive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/10/japan-nuclear-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-10T15:18:59Z","webTitle":"Japan to scrap nuclear power in favour of renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/10/japan-nuclear-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/10/japan-nuclear-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Japan to scrap nuclear power in favour of renewables","bodyText":"Japan will scrap a plan to obtain half of its electricity from nuclear power and will instead promote renewable energy as a result of its nuclear crisis, the prime minister said Tuesday. Naoto Kan said Japan needs to \"start from scratch\" on its long-term energy policy after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by a 11 March earthquake and tsunami and began leaking radiation. Japan's nuclear plants supplied about 30% of the country's electricity, and the government had planned to raise that to 50%. Kan told a news conference that nuclear and fossil fuel used to be the pillars of Japanese energy policy but now it will add two more – renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass, and an increased focus on conservation. \"We will thoroughly ensure safety for nuclear power generation and make efforts to further promote renewable energy,\" an area where Japan has lagged behind Europe and the US, he said. On Monday a landmark report by the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, said that renewable energy could account for 80% of the world's energy supply by 2050 – but only if governments pursue the right policies. Kan also said he would take a pay cut beginning in June until the Fukushima nuclear crisis is resolved to take responsibility as part of the government that has promoted nuclear energy. He didn't specify how much of a pay cut he would take. The operator of the stricken power plant, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), has been struggling for nearly two months to restore critical cooling systems that were knocked out by the disaster. Some 80,000 people living within a 12-mile radius of the plant were evacuated from their homes on 12 March, with many living in gymnasiums. On Tuesday, about 100 evacuees were allowed into that exclusion zone briefly to gather belongings from their homes. The excursion marked the first time the government has felt confident enough in the safety of the area to allow even short trips there. Residents have been pushing hard for weeks for permission to check up on their homes. The evacuees boarded chartered government buses for the two-hour visit. They were provided with protective suits, goggles and face masks to wear while in the zone, and were issued plastic bags to put their belongings in. They were also given dosimeters to monitor radiation levels and walkie-talkies. All were to be screened for radiation contamination after leaving the zone. More visits are planned, but residents fear they may never be able to return for good. Many had been secretly sneaking back into the zone during the day, but the government – concerned over safety and the possibility of theft – began enforcing stricter roadblocks and imposing fines on 22 April. The official visits were seen as a compromise that took both safety and the wishes of the residents into consideration. The government and Tepco in April projected that bringing the plant to a cold shutdown could take six to nine months and residents might be able to return to resume their lives. But they admit that timing is a best-case scenario. On Monday, another utility, Chubu Electric Power Co, agreed to shutter three reactors at a coastal power plant while it builds a seawall and improves other tsunami defenses there. Kan requested the temporary shutdown at the Hamaoka plant amid predictions an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher could strike the central Japanese region within 30 years. The government's decision came after evaluating Japan's 54 reactors for quake and tsunami vulnerability after the 11 March disasters. The Hamaoka facility sits above a major fault line and has long been considered Japan's riskiest nuclear power plant. Kan said Japan will have to compile Japan's new energy policy in a report for submission to the International Atomic Energy Agency in June. He didn't give any numerical estimates for each source of energy in the new policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/30/carbon-pricing-labor-albanese-shorten","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-30T05:11:54Z","webTitle":"Carbon pricing: Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten promise to stand firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/carbon-pricing-labor-albanese-shorten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/30/carbon-pricing-labor-albanese-shorten","fields":{"headline":"Carbon pricing: Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten promise to stand firm","bodyText":"Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten have pledged to Labor members that they will stand firm in support of carbon pricing, although the two leadership contenders have been urged to do more to tackle the party's internal division over the environment. A series of questions were submitted to Albanese and Shorten by the Labor environment action network, a grassroots Labor group that advocates strong action on the environment. The network, known as Lean, was established in 2004 and counts former foreign minister Bob Carr and federal MP Matt Thistlethwaite as members. Albanese and Shorten's answers, seen by Guardian Australia, show that both contenders have promised not to \"wave through\" a repeal of carbon pricing by the new Coalition government. \"Standing by our legacy is vital to opposing Tony Abbott's plans to wind back the measures we implemented in government,\" Shorten said. \"If elected leader I will fight any attempt by Tony Abbott to remove a price on carbon pollution and market-based mechanisms to address climate change.\" Shorten does, however, say that will look to work with Labor members to \"work on the next round of progressive, big thinking Labor policies on climate change.\" Albanese said Labor should \"never walk away from our great reforms\" on tackling climate change, promising to fight the repeal of the carbon price and the dismantling of the various climate change agencies associated with it. On other environmental matters, both candidates reaffirmed their opposition to nuclear power in Australia and attacked the Coalition's plan to devolve environmental assessment powers to the states. Shorten said he supported \"further policy work\" on a last-ditch election campaign pledge to look at bringing national parks under federal environmental protection. However, neither candidate would commit to any further intervention into Australia's fossil fuel industries, despite warnings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others that the world is rapidly eating through its \"carbon budget\" that provides a buffer to a two-degree temperature rise. Albanese, a former shadow environment minister, overall provided lengthier, and some may argue more impassioned, responses, which invoked Labor's environmental triumphs. \"Climate change affects the most vulnerable in our society the most,\" he said. \"Climate change threatens our environment, our economy and our way of life. No responsible government can ignore the advice of our leading scientists. Action on climate change therefore has to be one of Labor's highest priorities. \"As Labor people and as a Labor movement, I believe we have a duty to protect our natural habitats so that future generations can enjoy and benefit from them too. I will place sustainability – including environmental sustainability – at the core of federal Labor policy. \"Labor has a proud environmental record in delivering the big environmental reforms in Australian history. It was Labor who initiated the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. It was Hawke and Keating who protected the Franklin, Kakadu and the Daintree as well as Antarctica. \"It was Labor who ended 30 years of conflict over Tasmania's forests and 120 years of disagreement over the Murray Darling basin. If elected as leader of our great party, I will ensure that we continue to stand proud on this platform.\" Felicity Wade, co-convener of Lean, told Guardian Australia she was \"thrilled\" that both candidates had committed to backing the carbon price but said internal Labor tensions over the environment had to be resolved. \"There was talk of the commitment to the carbon price being in danger, so it's very important that both stand by it,\" she said. \"We certainly view Anthony Albanese as a strong advocate for the environment. \"He has a deep heritage in the area, which maybe Bill Shorten doesn't have. But we are also heartened by Bill's strong commitment to the environment in his answers. \"We are a little disappointed that neither chose to respond to the challenge of having a huge fossil fuel industry and its impact on global emissions. There are hard questions there that need to be answered. \"Labor has a fundamental problem over its commitment for economic growth and jobs and its commitment to the environment. Bob Hawke brought environment into the mix and tensions still remain on what people see as jobs versus the environment. The leadership needs to ensure that environmental values sit within our core values and resolve this tension.\" Wade said Labor's electoral recovery would rest, in part, on its ability to provide a set of clear environmental policies to voters. \"Labor needs to have a sophisticated position on the environment that shows it is pro-jobs without trashing the environment,\" she said. \"We have allowed the Greens to take away the space of the environment and we need to take it back. \"We sit between two extremes – the Greens and the Liberals. There's a huge opportunity there for us for a sensible middle ground on the environment.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/may/26/hans-blix-trident-abandon-britain-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-26T18:15:18Z","webTitle":"Hans Blix urges Britain to relinquish Trident nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/26/hans-blix-trident-abandon-britain-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/26/hans-blix-trident-abandon-britain-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Hans Blix urges Britain to relinquish Trident nuclear programme","bodyText":"Former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix has said it is time for Britain to relinquish its Trident nuclear programme. Speaking at the Hay literary festival, the Swedish international lawyer who led the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the Iraq war, said he did not see how the UK would be any more protected if it extended the life of the nuclear programme – at an estimated cost of £100bn. Delivering the 2013 Joseph Rotblat lecture to an audience of 1,600 festival goers, Blix said Washington \"was not pushing for this costly rearmament\" and asked if Trident was \"required to protect UK independence or UK pride\". \"Japan and Germany seem respected … even without nuclear weapons,\" he said.

But he said Blair's policy of liberal intervention, set out in a keynote foreign policy speech in Chicago in 1999, had undermined international law which had implications for current crises. He said: \"The risk of large wars may have gone but the risk of armed intervention remains. In most cases, say, North Korea, Syria … the cost of armed interventions in terms of lives and resources have limited temptations. \"But it may be asked what weight does international legal rule have per se?

One topic you will not hear discussed very often on Capitol Hill is the idea of ending one of the oldest American welfare programmes – the extraordinary amount of corporate welfare going to the nuclear energy industry. Many in Congress talk of getting \"big government off the back of private industry\". Here's an industry we'd like to get off the backs of the taxpayers. As, respectively, a senator who is the longest-serving independent in Congress and the president of an independent and non-partisan budget watchdog organisation, we do not necessarily agree on everything when it comes to energy and budget policy in the US. But one thing we strongly agree on is the need to end wasteful subsidies that prop up the nuclear industry. After 60 years, this industry should not require continued and massive corporate welfare. It is time for the nuclear power industry to stand on its own two feet. Nuclear welfare started with research and development. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, since 1948 the federal government has spent more than $95bn (in 2011 dollars) on nuclear energy research and development (R&amp;D). That is more than four times the amount spent on solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, biofuels, and hydropower combined. But federal R&amp;D was not enough; the industry also wanted federal liability insurance too, which it got back in 1957 with the Price-Anderson Act. This federal liability insurance programme for nuclear plants was meant to be temporary, but Congress repeatedly extended it, most recently through 2025. Price-Anderson puts taxpayers on the hook for losses that exceed $12. 6bn if there is a nuclear plant disaster. When government estimates show the cost for such a disaster could reach $720bn in property damage alone, that's one sweetheart deal for the nuclear industry! R&amp;D and Price-Anderson insurance are still just the tip of the iceberg. From tax breaks for uranium mining and loan guarantees for uranium enrichment to special depreciation benefits and lucrative federal tax breaks for every kilowatt hour from new plants, nuclear is heavily subsidised at every phase. The industry also bilks taxpayers when plants close down with tax breaks for decommissioning plants. Further, it is estimated that the cost to taxpayers for the disposal of radioactive nuclear waste could be as much as $100bn. Even with all of those subsidies, the private sector still will not agree to finance a new nuclear plant, so wealthy nuclear corporations recently secured access to $18.5bn in taxpayer-backed loan guarantees. Maybe the Wall Street banks agree with the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated the risk of default on nuclear loans at above 50%. The nuclear industry's financial troubles are not new. In the 1960s and 1970s, 100 reactors were cancelled because of cost overruns. Things were so bad Forbes called it \"the largest managerial disaster in business history\". Despite this history, some want to dramatically increase federal loan guarantees for nuclear plants. It is shocking that the nuclear industry continues to receive so much federal support at a time of record debt. Of course nuclear subsidies benefit some of the wealthiest and most powerful energy corporations in America, which may explain the persistence of nuclear welfare. For example, Exelon, which takes in $33bn in revenue annually, is the leading operator/owner of nuclear reactors in the US. Entergy, with revenues of more than $11bn annually, is the second largest. Together, these two companies own or operate almost one-third of US reactors, and based on their revenue they are doing pretty well. Why do they need endless federal welfare for their industry year after year? Will it ever end? Well, as secretary of energy Steven Chu confirmed at a recent Senate hearing, without federal liability insurance and loan guarantees, no one would ever build a new nuclear plant. Whether you support nuclear energy or not, we should all be able to agree that with record debt, we cannot afford to continue to subsidise this mature industry and its multibillion-dollar corporations. If the nuclear industry believes so fervently in its technology, then it and Wall Street investors can put their money where their mouth is. Let's let them finance it, insure it, and pay for it themselves. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/23/angela-merkel-save-britain-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-23T17:26:19Z","webTitle":"On Europe, Angela Merkel's election win may save Britain from itself | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/angela-merkel-save-britain-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/angela-merkel-save-britain-europe","fields":{"headline":"On Europe, Angela Merkel's election win may save Britain from itself","bodyText":"Across Europe, political leaders watch Angela Merkel with awe and envy. And rightly so. The German chancellor didn't just get re-elected on Sunday, a difficult enough task for leaders in post-crash Europe. Merkel won her hat-trick of victories in the most serene electoral performance of her career, pushing her centre-right CDU party's vote up by nearly eight points, and coming within a whisker of winning Germany's first overall majority since the days of Konrad Adenauer, more than half a century ago. The only cloud in Merkel's sky was the historic collapse of her junior coalition partners, the liberal FDP, who failed to win any seats in the Bundestag for the first time in 60 years. That leaves Merkel with the problem of trying to persuade either the Social Democrats, or conceivably the Greens, to come into a coalition which they may see as a fatal embrace. The nations of the eurozone's southern periphery will be hoping that some such deal is struck, as we all should, since a coalition with either of them holds out the hope of a relaxation of Merkel's strict pre-election budgetary orthodoxy. The Guardian dubbed Merkel the Special One yesterday. And as an election winner that's exactly what she is. Consider these freshly minted popularity ratings. In Britain, David Cameron has a favourable/unfavourable rating of 40%/52% – giving him net unpopularity of minus 12. In France, François Hollande's record low rating is 23%/76% – net unpopularity of minus 53. In Germany, by contrast, 70% think Merkel is doing a good job, against 30% who think she is doing a bad one – a net popularity of plus 40. What is Merkel's secret? The start of the answer is obviously that she is the leader of Europe's richest and most dynamic economy. Germany's economy is growing again, unemployment is low, the budget is in balance, interest rates are on the floor. Times are pretty good, and getting better for many Germans. Compared with the economic carnage elsewhere in the eurozone, – unemployment rates of 28% in Greece and 26% in Spain, mounting deficits and increased borrowing in France and Britain – Germany remains an oasis of relative calm and prosperity. Crisis, what crisis? But Merkel's success cannot simply be explained by her good fortune in being the leader of Germany. Even when faced with large German bailouts of the eurozone and by sluggish growth, the centre-left failed to make its case, just as the centre-right triumphed. The centre-left SPD remains stuck in its now much diminished core constituency – echoes of Labour here in Britain. So do the Greens and the Left party, both of whom slipped back. Yet Merkel has also won because of her own deft skills. Her republican centrism means that voters from other parties like her – one in six SPD voters preferred her as chancellor. Her willingness to adapt to circumstances, most notably in her U-turn over nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, is the antithesis of conviction politics. Add to this her inclusive image and her attractively unpretentious style, and you have a winning combination for difficult times. Merkel's success in appealing across Germany's fragmenting party divides is a lesson from which traditional tribal politicians in Britain could learn too. What will it mean for Europe? Merkel sometimes gives the impression that she takes each decision as it comes. But Berlin knows that the eurozone and the EU need serious attention before Germany's next election in 2017. So this victory gives her an immense opportunity to write the script for Europe's future. In an era of weak governments and unpopular leaders in Europe, she is uniquely positioned now to shape the next decade and more. In that context, the performance by the eurosceptic Alternative für Deutschland, who finished just short of the 5% Bundestag threshold, was another perfect result for Merkel. She does not have to take account of them in order to govern, but she knows they are out there, and will be wary. It would be in character for her to temper her European strategy accordingly. From Britain's point of view, her re-election could be fascinatingly significant. With Merkel at the helm in Europe, moderate Tory eurosceptics like David Cameron have someone with whom they can deal and who also carries real authority here. For Cameron, an EU deal with Merkel would make an EU referendum victory, assuming he wants it, far more likely. If Merkel wants to – and if she means it when she says she wants the UK to remain in the EU she should want to – she is now in a position to influence the British debate on Europe in a more positive way than any continental European since Jacques Delors. On the great issue of Europe, the re-elected and strengthened Merkel may even help save the British from themselves. Let's hope she does.

Japan is perhaps the most technologically advanced nation on Earth and yet, time after time, the report finds missing measures that I would have expected to already be in place. It highlights the fundamental inability for anyone to anticipate all future events and so deeply undermines the claims of the nuclear industry and its supporters that this time, with the new generation of reactors, things will be different. I used quote marks on the word \"independent\" because the report comes from the International Atomic Energy Association (pdf) (IAEA) which, while independent of Japan, is far from independent from the nuclear industry it was founded to promote. But this conflict of interest only makes the findings of the IEAE's experts more startling. So let's take a look at some of the 15 conclusions and 16 lessons (I've edited a bit for brevity). There were insufficient defence-in-depth provisions for tsunami hazards. In particular, although tsunami hazards were considered [in] 2002, the tsunami hazard was underestimated. Moreover, those additional protective measures were not reviewed and approved by the regulatory authority. Severe accident management provisions were not adequate to cope with multiple plant failures. So, they looked at the tsunami risk, badly underestimated the scale of what was needed and then the regulator failed to check their work. Japan has a well organized emergency preparedness and response system ... and dedicated and devoted officials and workers. [But] complicated structures and organizations can result in delays in urgent decision making. Even in one of the best nuclear safety regimes, the complexity of accidents can overwhelm the emergency response. The siting and design of nuclear plants should include sufficient protection against infrequent and complex combinations of external events and these should be considered in the plant safety analysis; Any changes in external hazards or understanding of them should be periodically reviewed for their impact on the current plant configuration This, in other words, says that the unexpected will occur and tacitly admits it can't be planned for. Plant layout should be based on maintaining a 'dry site concept', where practicable, as a defence-in-depth measure against site flooding; An active tsunami warning system should be established with the provision for immediate operator action. Nuclear power plants shouldn't be able to flood and need tsunami warning systems to operate safely, the inspectors conclude. It's very worrying that this is a \"lesson to be learned\", in a world where many reactors are already sited on coasts, while sea levels are rising and storms are increasing in intensity. For severe situations, such as total loss of off-site power or the engineering safety systems, simple alternative sources for these functions (such as mobile power, compressed air and water supplies) should be provided. Such provisions should be located at a safe place and the plant operators should be trained to use them. Nuclear sites should have adequate on-site seismically robust, suitably shielded, ventilated and well equipped buildings to house the Emergency Response Centres. More frighteningly obvious \"lessons\" to be learned: you need back-up equipment in a safe place that people know how to use, and somewhere safe for the emergency response to be run from. Emergency Response Centres should have available as far as practicable essential safety related parameters, such as coolant levels, containment status, pressure, etc, [delivered by] hardened instrumentation and lines. External events [can] affect several plants and several units at the plants at the same time. This requires a sufficiently large resource in terms of trained experienced people, equipment and supplies. The risk and implications of hydrogen explosions should be revisited and necessary mitigating systems should be implemented. Yet more \"lessons\": you need to ensure you know what's happening in the reactor, you need to have enough people to cope and the risk of hydrogen explosions has been underestimated. Nuclear regulatory systems should ensure that regulatory independence [is] preserved in all circumstances. The last lesson is also chilling, when you consider the implied alternative. To sum up, when you build a reactor you are committing to controlling the nuclear fury at its heart for half a century or more, and controlling the waste produced for many thousands of years (using methods no-one has yet developed). On those timescales, unforeseen events are a certainty, with hugely costly consequences. The earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan were extreme, and the IAEA report tries to argues that new nuclear safety regulations should learn lessons from the failure of the system at Fukushima to cope. But the real lesson is that it is impossible to cover all eventualities. That means nuclear power is not safe or, given the colossal clean-up costs, cheap. Regretfully, I believe it is an illusory answer to the problem of rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-interview-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-25T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Davey interview: 'I'm not going to give up on renewable energy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-interview-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-interview-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Ed Davey interview: 'I'm not going to give up on renewable energy'","bodyText":"It began with the announcement of the first new nuclear power station in Britain for decades and ended with frantic efforts to save Scotland's Grangemouth petrochemicals plant. In between John Major called for a windfall tax on energy profits and David Cameron responded with a promise to cut green taxes, leading to a coalition row. It sounds a dreadful week. But Ed Davey is feeling \"bullish on a number of fronts\", a member of his staff tells me as I arrive at the Department for Energy and Climate Change to meet the Liberal Democrat secretary of state. Davey has much to prove. His promotion to the cabinet in February last year looked awkward, forced as it was by Chris Huhne's resignation. Outside parliament, Lib Dem party circles and his Kingston constituency, he was barely known, and he lacks both the smooth, television-friendly manners of a Cameron or Clegg, and the heft brought to parliament by those with a previous career (Davey got a job with the Liberal Democrats a few months after leaving university). Huhne, seen as a formidable bulwark against the climate-sceptic Tory right, was a hard act to follow. The resurgence of what Davey calls the \"Tory tea party tendency\" is linked by some to Huhne's retreat. But Davey, highly regarded by the Lib Dems for the work he did under business secretary Vince Cable on the privatisation of the Royal Mail, knows he's tough. He was orphaned at 15, and a carer for his widowed mother before that. If his path through an elite education to government was the typically smooth ride of the modern career politician (private school, Oxford college, job as a party researcher), family life was not, and in 2007 his first child with wife Emily Gasson, John, was born with serious disabilities. Davey spoke about his difficulties getting the right treatment for his son at last year's party conference, and said bereavement had made him resilient. In 1995 he won two awards for bravery after coming to the rescue of a woman pushed on to the track in front of an approaching train at London's Clapham Junction. \"I'm enjoying my job very much,\" he says when I ask if challenging personal experiences have made him harder than many of his colleagues. \"I think people are surprised I am winning so many battles all the time,\" he says. \"What I saw in my first year as secretary of state was a danger that if Britain didn't lead the way on climate change nothing would happen. I thought: If I don't lead, no one else is going to.\" But if Davey is determinedly upbeat, seeing a \"rosy future\" for Grangemouth now the industrial dispute has been settled and not dwelling on workers' lost rights, others look on this week as yet another defeat for the Lib Dems, once as fierce in their defence of the environment as they were in their objections to foreign wars and tuition fees. The coalition agreement promised \"no public subsidy\" for nuclear. The Hinkley deal allows billions of pounds to be paid to French company EDF, as well as loan guarantees. Davey defended this in the Guardian earlier this week. Now he says, \"I struck a very tough, tough bargain with EDF – I was the toughest in government, others would have signed a lot earlier. I refused to sign. I wanted to make sure we got the best deal for the consumer, and transferred all the construction risk from the consumer to the developer, which has never happened before.\" Scroll forward 48 hours from Monday's announcement to the prime minister promising in the House of Commons to \"roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills\", and it's like a green bad dream. Then there are the five British activists and photographer Kieron Bryan, still in jail in Russia six weeks after being captured during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic. Why isn't the government doing more to help? Last week German chancellor Angela Merkel called Vladimir Putin, even though no Germans are involved. \"We're in contact with them and providing consular assistance,\" says Davey. Born on Christmas day in 1965, Ed Davey is descended from Nottinghamshire miners. His father, a solicitor, died when Edward, the youngest of three boys, was four. His mother, a teacher, developed cancer in his early teens. After her death he lived with his brothers and grandparents and became head boy at the fee-paying Nottingham High School, where Ed Balls was in the year below. After a year off when he worked in a pork pie factory and on a French campsite, he took a first-class degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford. A devout believer in markets and competition, Davey shopped around before joining the Liberal Democrats, going to at least one Young Conservative event (\"I sat in the corner\") and listening to David Miliband and Stephen Twigg at the Oxford University Labour Club before deciding neither party was for him. Instead he campaigned on environmental issues and helped promote tactical voting in the 1987 general election. Six months after leaving university he answered a job ad in the Guardian and became economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats, studying in the evenings for an MSc in economics. He left to work as a management consultant before being elected at his first attempt, as MP for Kingston and Surbiton, by a majority of just 56 in 1997. His wife was not so lucky. She was a candidate in the same election and has since stood three times against Conservative Robert Walter in North Dorset, coming closest to victory with 40% of the vote in 2005, the year she and Davey married. At the Liberal Democrat conference last month, Davey told the Guardian that if more women are not elected in 2015, the party may have to try all-women shortlists, so poor is its record. Just 12% of Liberal Democrat MPs are women, and Gasson, a solicitor, will not be making a fifth attempt to join them in 2015 because she is pregnant with their second child and, Davey says, \"too busy\". Now he is up for a fight. Last month he was reported to have called in cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood after a series of rows with environment secretary Owen Paterson. Paterson wanted to publish a report he had commissioned on how wind farms harm the rural economy. Davey insisted this was straying into the energy secretary's brief. After our interview, another row with Paterson blew up, when Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith attacked the environment secretary's views on GM crops. Davey is surely enjoying Paterson's discomfort over this and the chaos surrounding the culling of badgers (last month he accused Paterson of trying to \"cull\" wind turbines). Last year Davey called climate sceptics on Conservative bankbenches the \"Tory tea party tendency\". When I suggest this group has advanced with Paterson's promotion, and George Osborne's declaration that Britain should give up its leadership role on climate change, he agrees \"that tendency\" has not gone away. But is it getting stronger? In July Davey spent the whole of a 15-minute TV interview with Andrew Neil fending off the suggestion that global warming is a non-urgent problem. Last week, science writer Matt Ridley, who is Paterson's brother-in-law, argued in the Spectator that climate change is good. But Davey says: \"It has not got stronger, because the Lib Dems are in the coalition fighting for the green agenda on climate change and we are succeeding.\" Then there's the fraught issue of energy bills. An enthusiast for detail, Davey gives me a hand-out showing how a 2013 household energy bill breaks down. What he calls \"green taxes\", the 4% of the average £1,267 bill that goes towards subsidising renewables, is shaded green, and he will \"fight like a tiger\" to keep these, he says, before pointing out that this won't be necessary because they won't even be discussed. The portion of energy bills that he and Nick Clegg believe could be paid for instead via general taxation is the 5% that goes on energy-efficiency measures including the Warm Home Discount, mostly for the poor. \"Let's be clear how hard we've fought for this,\" he says. \"The Tories wanted to get rid of fuel poverty targets. I stopped them. We'd be completely daft to get rid of those because what you'd be doing is solving the energy bill crisis on the backs of the poorest. No, absolutely not, won't agree to it, forget it. If that can be funded in a more generous way, then hey, I'm all ears.\" Critics of coalition policy point to the failure to plan a reduction in demand for energy, and question the scientific and economic basis for new nuclear and hugely controversial fracking. Davey prefers to focus on the good news: \"We've had a target for renewable electricity for 2020 of 30%, and I predict we'll beat that target. I don't know if it's going to be by 1%, 2% or 5%, but we're going to beat the 30% target. No one would have thought it but we're already halfway there. The green taxes we have been pushing as Liberal Democrats in this government have been extraordinarily successful and point to an extremely green, clean energy future. They're not being touched and they won't be touched. It's incredibly important for investors that they hear that.\" But if Davey has grown accustomed to attacks from the right, as he defends the last piece of ground the Liberal Democrats have left from which to make the case that they are a moderating influence on the Conservatives, he sounds angriest when he talks about \"Mr Miliband\". He can't stand Labour's new 20-month price freeze policy and deliberately echoes David Cameron (told off by the Speaker of the House of Commons this week for calling Miliband a \"con man\") by calling it a \"con\". \"I will bash on about him because he did nothing in government on this. He created the big six. In 2000 there were three generating companies and 14 suppliers – 17 companies – and after Labour's reforms there was the big six. Well, well done! We're having to change that. We've got lots of new generators coming in and we've now got 15 independent suppliers. \"Labour created the monster, we're defeating it. Labour's policy would recreate the monster. Imagine a 20-month price freeze. Wholesale prices on international markets, which I don't think Ed Miliband is claiming he controls, go up by 10%. That's 47% of the bill. If you're a small supplier, you'd go bankrupt. If you're a big company, you'd take it on your balance sheet. Prices go up, small, independent competitors go out of business, the big six is created again. Well done, Mr Miliband! You really understand market economics don't you?\" Davey calls himself a \"zealot\" about tackling climate change. He is also a zealot for markets, and enraged that painstaking efforts at increasing competition between suppliers (Davey buys his energy from Sainsbury's, having switched from EDF, saving himself £240 in June) have been drowned out in a Labour-led chorus of disapproval about gigantic corporations' greed. For Davey the true solution is simple, and comes down to consumer choice. Currently the least likely customers to switch suppliers are the poorest – an \"elderly lady\", he says, \"might be a bit scared\" – so his department is training community energy advisers to help them make up their minds. He even has a tip: \"The leading independent supplier – I won't name them but you can see for yourself - has a deal at the moment where the rate is fixed until April 2015. With British Gas's current price rise you'd save £240.\" The supplier is First Utility. But if consumers are the key to fixing the energy market, Davey knows we can't solve the problem of climate change on our own – and here lies his argument with the right. Osborne is wrong: Britain must take a global lead on climate change, and the government must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and its powerful friends. Davey is \"more optimistic than many people\", he says, pointing to the plummeting cost of renewables. He thinks concentrated solar power is the best long-term bet and isn't sure whether another next generation of nuclear power stations will be needed after this one. For now it is part of the \"mixed approach\" he has taken from his chief scientist, David MacKay, whose book Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air he read two summers ago and sounds like the basis of current policy. As his advisers hustle him off to see the Guardian's photographer, Davey jabs his finger at my voice recorder: \"I am not going to give up on renewable energy. They are not going to touch it, and I am not going to betray the fuel poor. That, for me, is a complete red line. I feel passionate about that.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2013/may/05/another-view-wright-way","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-05T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"A health and safety manager's view on The Wright Way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/05/another-view-wright-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/05/another-view-wright-way","fields":{"headline":"A health and safety manager's view on The Wright Way","bodyText":"I have no idea why Ben Elton chose to set this TV comedy in the health and safety department of a council called \"Basilricky\", clearly a play on Basildon and Billericay.

It definitely wasn't filmed round here, and I'm nothing like the main character, Gerald Wright. I'm much better looking, for a start. Neither am I anything like as pernickety.

The Tohoku earthquake and ensuing tsunami claimed an estimated 20,000 lives, washing away entire towns and wreaking havoc with the nation's infrastructure. An oil refinery was set ablaze leading to the death of six workers and a reservoir also failed, killing a further four people. The nuclear reactors at Fukushima experienced a partial meltdown causing the release of radiation, but killing no one. The media's treatment of the entire disaster, however, was completely out of kilter with these facts. The unfolding events at the stricken power station quickly dominated the coverage, ousting the actual earthquake and its dreadful aftermath from the headlines and, it seems, our collective memories. A year later we talk of the anniversary of the Fukushima disaster, not the far, far greater tragedy of the Tohoku earthquake. In no way do I wish to make light of the suffering of the thousands evacuated from the exclusion zone around the power station, nor to undervalue the immense bravery of the workers who, under extreme pressure, worked tirelessly to minimise the impact of the accident. But we need to keep things in perspective. This was a terrible event, caused by a much more terrible event, which again brought to the surface the many troubling aspects of how the nuclear industry operates. For instance, the siting of reactors on the eastern seaboard of a country highly vulnerable to earthquakes ought to have necessitated far more preventative measures or, better yet, the decision not to build there at all. The reactor itself was over 40 years old and operating company Tepco had been criticised ahead of the accident for lax safety standards. The events in Fukushima do not justify a wholesale rejection of nuclear power. We have been able to harness the fissioning of the nucleus of an atom for good and evil, for life-saving medical treatments and to create the atom bomb. Somewhere on this scale of achievements lies our use of nuclear energy. And even within this, not all nuclear power is equal. The inventor of the technology upon which most of today's operating nuclear power stations are based, Alvin Weinberg, was all too aware of this. He worried about some of the safety issues involved in using solid uranium fuel in his water-cooled reactors. He believed this configuration, though useful for creating materials for nuclear weapons, posed too many safety risks and created too much hazardous waste for widespread civilian use. As a result, he also directed a research team that invented a radically differently designed reactor, based on using chemically stable liquid salts as the coolant, and thorium as the fuel. Sadly, though he advocated safer, cleaner nuclear designs for the rest of his life, the world took no heed and the reactors we live with today are still fundamentally the same as those that he considered unnecessarily complex and vulnerable to accident. Fortunately, one of the legacies of Fukushima is that while investment in today's current reactor designs may have slowed, there is a renewed interest in Alvin's alternative designs and in other fundamentally different approaches. In China, a major R&amp;D programme into thorium molten salt reactors is underway, with the first test reactors to be completed in 2015 and a larger-scale demo ready by the end of the decade. In the US, safer, molten salt cooled pebble bed reactors are being developed. In Europe, there are various research programmes into new designs. Even here in the UK, where nuclear R&amp;D has been starved of investment, important but fragmented research is underway and, with the help of the Weinberg Foundation, I have helped to set up an all-party parliamentary group dedicated to exploring the potential of thorium-based energy. Fukushima must mark a turning point in the history of nuclear power. The proponents of the existing technologies should be chastened by the reminder it provided of how things can go wrong. Even if they are not, the providers of investment, both public and private, have had a wake-up call and will proceed with far greater caution. But the twin concerns of climate change and energy security mean we cannot afford to turn our back on nuclear altogether, as there is no greater potential source of energy on the planet. It is still an amazing achievement to have harnessed the vast energy forged into the heart of an atom during the dying moments of a star, and a safer, cleaner form of nuclear power is possible. As we move forward we need to admit to the failings of the current technologies and commit to developing new ones now. To try to use Fukushima to justify a complete disavowal of the use of nuclear power would be a gross distortion of the extent of the threat it posed. It would also consign the world to greater use of fossil fuels and higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, unleashing many more natural disasters with huge loss of life. This is the real risk we need to be vigilant against."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2015/oct/19/david-cameron-sets-out-anti-extremism-strategy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T17:23:36Z","webTitle":"Jamie Oliver urges Cameron to 'be brave' and impose a sugar tax -","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/oct/19/david-cameron-sets-out-anti-extremism-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2015/oct/19/david-cameron-sets-out-anti-extremism-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Oliver urges Cameron to 'be brave' and impose a sugar tax -","bodyText":"It’s been a busy day, with David Cameron, the prime minister, launching his “anti-extremism” strategy as well as making the case for two new pieces of law – the investigatory powers bill and a counter-terrorism bill. Cameron said: The extremist narrative needs to be fought every day at the kitchen table, on the university campus, online and on the airwaves. The Muslim Council of Britain responded and said such anti-extremism plans had “McCarthyist undertones.” Labour’s shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said the governmnet had to “get the balance right” on counter-extremism, adding: “The last thing we should do is to alienate the Muslim community.” Cameron then addressed the commons about his recent trip to the European Council. The main discussion points were the refugee crisis, extra assistance for Turkey, and loss of jobs at Redcar. Jamie Oliver, the TV chef, addressed the health committee and implored the government to “be brave” enforce a 20% sugar tax on a litre of drink. Meanwhile Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, defended last week’s decision to allow a grammar school in Kent, to open a new site as part of a major expansion. Finally, Theresa May the home secretary said the Wilson Doctrine protects MPs from being spied on still applies, despite a court ruling that the convention has no legal basis. Thanks for following the liveblog, and you can tweet me at @aishagani. My colleague Frances Perraudin will be back tomorrow, taking you through the day’s political events. Have a good evening. Commenting on the prime minister’s EU statement today Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said: “The UK is not leading on the EU issue or refugee and the Prime Minister is just posturing. We have a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep and our inaction is hurting our neighbours. He is damaging our reputation in the world. He added: “Britain deserves better than this. We have had enough of the spin and the careful calibration of the minimum effort for the maximum headline.“ Now moving back to Jamie Oliver’s select committee appearance, where he said public polls on sugar tax are “favouring it quite strongly”, he was confident that such a sweet-tooth duty would not be ruled out. He urged Cameron to be “brave” and implement the 20% tax on each litre of sugary drinks. Asked what he would like to see in the Government’s forthcoming obesity strategy, Oliver said: “I think my passion having worked with the British and international public for 17 years and having daily communications and monthly communication with millions of parents out there - is clarity.” Jamie Oliver’s petition calling for a #sugartax, which already has nearly 148,000 signatures, was shared on twitter too: However, not everyone agreed with his bold proposals. In fact on social media some said it may adversely affect the public in other ways: Oliver, speaking at the all parliamentary party group on diabetes now said: “The amount of MPs here today hopefully reflects the recognition that we need to tackle type 2 diabetes” He added: “British people will make good decisions if given clarity. All you need to know is how much sugar is in a bottle it packet.” The current discussion twitter can be followed under the hashtag: #SugarTax Diabetes UK is also live-tweeting the event, and here is a close-up of Oliver’s suggested labelling: Sir Edward Leigh, tory MP for Gainsborough, said funding for grammar schools had declined vociferously and that worse performing state schools received more. Morgan said her party’s manifesto promised fair funding and that £390mn was invested for fairness. Ian Austin MP, the Labour MP for Dudley North, said he did not agree with Morgn that quality of schooling has become better but that the UK had slid down the league tables and that poorer students should be able to attend good private schools. Morgan replied by saying Labour had abolished the assisted places scheme and had not implemented pupil premium. Answering Andrew Gwynne, the Denton and Reddish Labour MP, Morgan sad the law would not be changed and that the choice to open the new grammar school last week was a very particular case. Back to the Commons Nicky Morgan, the education minister, has made a statement on school expansion. It follows her announcement last week about he department approving a new grammar school in Sevenoaks, Kent. It is thought the government’s decision however is likely to prompt more schools to apply for grammar school status Labour last week however had accused Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, of “attempting to subvert the law”. Jamie Oliver said the enemy of healthy food in schools was packed lunch, and that sometimes when a teacher removes unhealthy foods it can cause a fractious conversation ad there currently no governmnet guidelines on this. Oliver said he has stood at the schoolgates and looked into the lunchboxes because “I want to know” what kids were eating. He ended by saying that by January he believed positive changes would be made and that “we have to get medieval” on the issue of unhealthy school meals. To recap the main points made by Oliver were: that his main role in front of the committee was “as a dad”. there was a need for a “sugar tax” and was the Government’s view, he said. “The discussions that I’ve had have not implied that that is written off. He said: “The discussions I’ve had are robust...Mr Cameron is reviewing everything. “I think where he is positioned for the next five years...we need to make sure that he’s brave,” Jamie Oliver said. He added that public polls on the need for a “sugar tax are favouring it quite strongly”. While Jamie Oliver has been addressing the select committee, commentators on twitter have been sharing their thoughts. Here are a few reactions: When Oliver was asked whether his campaign was negative, he said: “we’re not knocking off the halo of the British kid, it’s about putting the halo back,” and that such sugary products had been presented as positive for too long. During his interactive session, Jamie Oliver handed out sugar drinks that he had plastered clear labels about sugar levels to committee members. “The ill health that we are suffering is lack of clarity and wanting to help British parents”, he said. Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health committee, pointed out that the drinks already had labels telling people how much sugar was in them. Oliver responded and said he didn’t care if the industry will be hurt, or more important than children’s health. “Over my dead body” he said. “I was born in industry, I worked in a pub” he said and that his sort of labels were more powerful. Oliver said there was still an issue in the country and “we have to join the dots” so that good food could be distributed around the country. He said it could be the first generation in which children could be teaching their parents. “We’ve normalised the consumption of sugary foods and drinks at home which is completely inappropriate” and that sugary drinks were “not hydration” he said. Oliver said it was a time to “mop up inconsistencies.” He said junk food should not be advertised before 9pm – singling out such adverts during Britain’s Got Talent, the ITV Saturday night talent show. He said however we were nearly there, as advertising for junk food between children’s TV programmes had stopped. When asked whether such a sugar tax would unfairly affect people on lower socio-economic background, Oliver passed around a brief about Sugar Rush and said it was pioneering and that others would follow. “It’s a profoundly important time” he said. On profitability, he said within supermarkets it has to be easier to make the right choice and promote a better balance. He said his suggestion was that there should be a three year 20% tax on each litre of sugary drink. Many public health experts support the call for a 20% tax on sugary drinks, which they believe would reduce consumption, as even a 10% tax has in Mexico, which has one of the world’s worst obesity problems and high rates of type 2 diabetes. The tax could raise £1bn, according to Sustain, the campaigners for a sugar duty, which should be spent in initiative to prevent childhood obesity and diet-related disease. Oliver was questioned about some of the sugary products sold at his restaurant chain at Gatwick. Oliver said he was not aware of this and would review it. He said his restaurant was one of the few in an airport to bake fresh bread. Jamie Oliver, when asked, said he was not demonising sugar – “I think sugar is great.” He said there was honest and dishonest sugar: chocolate and cake being honest, cereal, sugary drinks being dishonest. Jamie Oliver said diet and controlling sugar is something that we had to be passionate about, in regards to children’s health, and urged for a sugar tax. He said after the imposition of such a tax: “everything will cascade off it beautifully”. Switching to a select committee now, Jamie Oliver the TV chef, meets with senior MPs to talk about sugary drinks and the issue of childhood obesity. He said clamping down on sugary drinks was seen as radical by some in the UK as: “the French are doing it, the Mexicans are doing it.” He called the prime minister “to be brave” and do the right thing for public health, such as considering a sugar tax. Keith Vaz, the senior Labour MP said he welcomed the additional support to Turkey and what was already being done to resettle the refugees but said: the scenes of refugees being shuttled from country to anther country was contrary to the values of Europe. He asked what else would be done particularly to stop people smugglers. In answer to Andrew Tyrie MP for Chichester, Cameron said that possible to boil down the the question on Europe and said that it has: “got to be possible to be a successful member outside the European Union as it is to be inside the European union”. He said the Britain’s approach would make this possible. Yvette Cooper, the senior Labour MP, stands now. She said that the Shengen agreement was not the cause of the refugee crisis. She said of the humanitarian crisis: “please will the Prime Minister show some leadership and not just outside Europe” and help refugees arriving to Europe in Greece?” Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, asked Cameron about the actions of Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, who said he wanted to keep migrants out of Europe. Cameron, in answer to Corbyn, said it was right to offer some financial assistance to Turkey as the country was helping 2 million refugees. He reiterated the UK was not part of Schengen so could not do more about the brders. He said there would be a report after Christmas on the update of the number of refugees helped. PM says: “Bishops were wrong” about him, and that he had not ignored their pleas to provide further assistance to refugees In response to a letter signed by 84 bishops of the Church of England who accused David Cameron of ignoring their offers to help to provide housing, foster care and other support for up to 50,000 refugees –the prime minister flatly denied this and said “I have great respect for the bishops” but added that on this occasion “the Bishops were wrong.” The Prime Minister replied by insisting the UK’s stance has gained “a lot of respect” within the EU, adding the 84 Church of England bishops who have asked him to accept at least 50,000 Syrian refugees are “wrong”. Mr Cameron suggested the bishops should press other countries to fulfil their aid commitments. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, asked the prime minister to confirm whether there would be votes for 16 year olds on the European Referendum. He said about the refugee crisis that the duty should not be outsourced to other countries. He said he welcomed the government helping refugee camps but asked what was being done to help refugees that had come to the UK. He asked for more details on the “command structure” organised to deal with people smuggling across European borders. Corbyn said the situation in Syria was complex, that the humanitarian crisis had led to half the population, the vast majority fleeing to neighbouring countries, but said there needed to be a political solution. Speaking in the Commons, he asked how many Syrian refugees have been accepted under the Government’s scheme to relocate vulnerable people. Corbyn, who praised the UK’s aid effort in response to the Syrian crisis, added: “Will you give a substantive reply to the letter from 84 bishops calling on you to accept 50,000 refugees? “If Britain played a more positive role on this front, it may create the goodwill in Europe to make headway in your other forthcoming negotiations.” He urged for safe spaces in Syria itself to help humanitarian aid. He asked, finally, whether Cameron had asked his Italian counterpart over job losses as SSI Redcar plant. Cameron begins by saying 8,000 people are arriving in Germany each day. The UK does not take part in Schengen and is not participating in the quota system. Britain would be taking 20,000 refugees from the camps, Cameron said, adding that he thought “this is the right approach”. The council condemned the brutality of Isil and Assad, Cameron said, in equal measure. He updated the House telling them that part of the the European Council conclusion was that Turkey should be included to be a part of a comprehensive cooperation agenda based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery. He said that he had challenged the raised the issue of Russia’s involvement, and said that 8 out of 10 out of Russia’s attacks were against opposition of Assad, not Isil. Hello, good afternoon. I’m Aisha Gani and I’ll be anchoring the politics liveblog now, covering David Cameron’s statement statement in the Commons on the recent meeting of the European Council. Cameron is expected to update the House having attended the meeting of the European Council on 15 October 2015. Among points of discussion was the current migration and refugee crisis in Europe. I’m handing over to my colleague Aisha Gani for the rest of the afternoon. She’ll be live blogging the prime minister’s statement updating MPs on last week’s European Council meeting and the debate on the Wilson Doctrine. There will also be an oral statement on grammar schools. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for the comments! A reminder of the key points in the Wilson Doctrine case: The convention is named after former prime minister Harold Wilson, who pledged in 1966 that MPs’ and peers’ phones would not be tapped. He told the Commons “that there was to be no tapping of the telephones of members of parliament ... [but] that, if there was any development which required a change in the general policy, [he] would at such moment as seemed compatible with the security of the country, on [his] own initiative, make a statement in the house about it”. In December 1997, the then prime minister, Tony Blair, said the doctrine extended to electronic communication, including emails. Two Green party parliamentarians, Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, and Baroness Jenny Jones brought a case to the investigatory powers tribunal, complaining that disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden made it clear that GCHQ was capturing their communications. The tribunal ruled last week that it was “satisfied that the Wilson doctrine is not enforceable in English law”, and that it was merely “a political statement in a political context, encompassing the ambiguity that is sometimes to be found in political statements”. Lucas and Jones are now calling on the government to include specific protections for MPs and peers in upcoming legislation on surveillance. Downing Street described the Wilson doctrine first expressed in 1966 as a political statement, without legal force, and pointed out that the intelligence agencies might be monitoring an individual who was in contact with an MP. It refused to say whether any MPs’ phones, either at Westminster or in their constituencies, were being currently being monitored by the intelligence agencies. This was interesting on the Daily Politics from Sir David Omand, former director of GCHQ – Ahead of the debate on the Wilson Doctrine, the Green party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas, has released a statement calling for the protection of MPs communications to be enshrined in law. The MP for Brighton Pavilion said: Recent statements by ministers suggested that the Wilson Doctrine was in force – yet last week’s ruling indicates that this crucial protection has been shredded. MPs were repeatedly told that blanket surveillance wasn’t permitted because of the Wilson Doctrine – yet it is in fact taking place and constitutes a grave breach of our constituents’ privacy. The Government must now come clean about what they knew about the status of the Wilson Doctrine. Members of the public should be able to expect representation without their privacy being compromised. Indeed blanket surveillance of politicians is nothing short of a stain on our parliamentary democracy - it must be stopped. It is crucial that upcoming legislation on surveillance includes a provision to protect the communications of MPs, Peers, MSPs, AMs and MEPS from extra-judicial spying. For the sake of constituents – and to protect whistle-blowers who need to contact parliamentarians – the protection of national politicians’ communications must now be enshrined in law. The Telegraph is reporting that Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox has resigned from parliament’s sleaze watchdog after failing to declare hundreds of thousands of pounds of outside income on time. Cox, who is a QC, has apologised and referred himself to the standards commissioner. The Torridge and West Devon MP is known as one of parliament’s highest earners, and has argued that continuing to practise law alongside his parliamentary duties means he has “practical experience of a world outside politics”. According to the latest register of members’ financial interests, Mr Cox received £325,000 on June 15 and 16 this year for 500 hours of work carried out between June 2014 and March 2015. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has been on the BBC’s World at One, making comments about the government’s tax credit plans which will not be appreciated by Downing Street. While Johnson said it was “brave” of Osborne to attempt to change the tax credit system, which he said needed reform, he also said: “Irrespective of the politics of it, nobody wants to do something that is not fair to working people.” “This is something that is under intensive review and consultation at the moment,” said Johnson. “I have no doubt that people are working very, very hard right now to try to make sure that, as we reform the tax credit system, we do so in such a way as not to bear down too unfairly on the hard working people on low incomes in my city, London, and elsewhere.” Johnson used his speech at the Conservative party conference to deliver a coded warning to Osborne about the impact of tax credit cuts of up to £1,300 per family. He said: “We must ensure that as we reform welfare and we cut taxes that we protect the hardest working and lowest paid: shop workers, cleaners, the people who get up in the small hours or work through the night because they have dreams for what their families can achieve.” Two Conservative MPs, David Davis and Stephen McPartland, voted against the government’s reforms to tax credits last month. Hilary Benn, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, has written to Philip Hammond asking him to intervene with Interserve after the reports of disciplinary action against FCO cleaners. Here is the text of the letter – I have read with great concern reports in the press today regarding disciplinary action taken by Interserve, a contractor working for the FCO, against cleaners in their employment who work at the FCO’s offices. It appears that a letter sent to you dated 21 July 2015 by a number of cleaners asking for a meeting to discuss the possibility of receiving a Living Wage was used as part of this action by Interserve. I spoke to one of your cleaners today who told me about this and she was very upset about what happened. I understand that other government departments do pay the Living Wage to their cleaners. Indeed your Cabinet colleague Iain Duncan Smith MP met with cleaners asking for the Living Wage and ensured they got it. I have some questions that I would be grateful if you could answer: · Did your office pass this letter to Interserve and, if so, were any comments made about its contents? · Is the FCO aiming to become an accredited Living Wage employer and, if so, by when? · Will you investigate what happened and intervene with Interserve to ensure that citizens exercising their democratic right to write to a Government minister are able to do so without having to fear repercussions from their employer? The people who clean your offices are trusted colleagues who work in a sensitive environment. They should be treated with dignity and respect, and if their colleagues elsewhere in Whitehall are now being paid the Living Wage then I cannot see why they should not be treated equally. I do hope that you will ensure that a Living Wage is paid to the cleaners at the FCO in time for Christmas. Labour’s shadow policing minister Jack Dromey has been speaking to the BBC. He said it was crucial that the government should “get the balance right” on counter-extremism: “The last thing we should do is to alienate the Muslim community.” He likened the government’s approach to that taken with Irish republican terrorism, which he said served to drive “a whole community into the hands of the IRA”. The prime minister’s got to be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism. The government has published its full counter-extremism strategy, setting out plans to set up a full review of all public institutions to safeguard them against the risk of ‘entryism’ by extremists. It will also include an official investigation into the application of Sharia law, new powers to intervene in the activities of faith-based “supplementary schools” and a new “extremism community trigger” to guarantee the police will take seriously complaints from the public about suspected extremists.The Muslim Council of Britain issued a statement responding to the announcement saying it was based on “fuzzy conceptions of British values”. “The measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,” said Dr Shuja Shafi, the organisation’s secretary general. MPs will debate the Wilson Doctrine – a convention that the UK’s intelligence agencies will not eavesdrop on members of parliament – after around 2.30pm. Writing for Progress, former Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said: Today’s debate is probably timely. However I hope MPs will resist the temptation to use misplaced arguments about their own importance and ill founded conspiracy theories to try to protect an outdated ‘doctrine’. A modern, transparent legally sound basis for interception and protection from it is what is needed now. David Cameron has insisted that the UK’s new “golden era” with China will not harm the special relationship with the US, as he prepares to roll out the red carpet for a historic state visit by the country’s president, Xi Jinping this week. Xi’s first official visit to London, beginning tomorrow, is expected to be marked by protests by activists against human rights abuses, and concerns that the UK is jeopardising national security by allowing Chinese state companies to invest in British nuclear power plants. John Cridland, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 2015 will be a year to remember for China and Britain. Despite a slight slowdown in China’s growth, its choice of the City of London to lead the world in debt issuance in renminbi and the Chancellor’s recent visit are signs that our thriving trading partnership lies at the heart of the UK’s economic future. From infrastructure projects to digital technology, the UK is the top destination for Chinese foreign direct investment in Europe, whilst UK exports to China have more than trebled since 2007. President Xi’s State Visit is a timely sign of the ever-deepening importance of the relationship between Britain and China. It will help further strengthen the trading bonds that link our two countries, and thus drive growth and create jobs in both our nations. Here’s some Twitter reaction to the counter-extremism strategy. From Jonathan Russell at the Quilliam Foundation – From Kevin Maguire, associate editor at the Mirror – From the law and policy blogger David Allen Green – A statement from the Henry Jackson Society, a rightwing think tank which has previously been accused of pushing an anti-Muslim agenda. HJS has long highlighted the threat posed to both national security and British society by extremists and believes the government is largely on the right track. The UK already has a world-leading counter-terrorism strategy and the Prime Minister has taken important steps to redefine the debate in recent months. Many of the new initiatives are vital in protecting the British public and HJS welcomes in particular the measures that empower individuals and institutions to challenge extremists, something we have consistently called for. However, much work remains to be done and some significant concerns remain. In particular these relate to anticipated measures - such as extremism disruption orders – which restrict freedom of expression and may risk undermining these welcome steps. In a foreword to the counter-extremism strategy, David Cameron writes that the fight against Islamist extremism is “one of the great struggles of our generation”. In responding to this poisonous ideology, we face a choice. Do we close our eyes, put our kid gloves on and just hope that our values will somehow endure in the end? Or do we get out there and make the case for those values, defend them with all that we’ve got and resolve to win the battle of ideas all over again? In the past, I believe governments made the wrong choice. Whether in the face of Islamist or neo-Nazi extremism, we were too tolerant of intolerance, too afraid to cause offence. We seemed to lack the strength and resolve to stand up for what is right, even when the damage being done by extremists was all too clear. Here are some key announcements in the strategy - An independent review will be set up to understand the extent to which Shari’a is being “misused or applied in a way which is incompatible with the law”. This will be expected to provide an initial report to the Home Secretary in 2016. A full review will be set up to ensure all public sector institutions are safeguarded from the risk posed by ‘entryism’. The review will report in 2016 and will cover schools, further and higher education colleges, local authorities, the NHS and the civil service. A group will be created that brings industry, government and the public together to agree ways to limit access to terrorist and extremist content online without compromising the principle of an open internet. The group will take inspiration from the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which the document says has been successful in tackling child sexual exploitation content online. The Department for Education will introduce a new system to enable intervention in “unregulated education settings which teach children intensively” or “supplementary schools”. This intervention will apply if there are concerns about the safety or welfare of the children attending them, including from extremism. “This will provide for the registration of settings so that they can be inspected and will introduce appropriate sanctions to protect children,” the strategy says. Here is a first take on the counter-extremism strategy from the Guardian’s home affairs editor, Alan Travis. A major government “counter-ideology campaign at pace and scale” to combat Islamist and other forms of extremism in Britain is at the heart of the new counter-extremism strategy published on Monday. The campaign will include a full review of all public institutions to safeguard them against the risk of ‘entryism’ by extremists, including schools, colleges, the civil service and local authorities. The launch of the hunt for extremists across the public sector follows the Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham schools. “The review will clearly set out the risk posed and advise on measures to guard against entryism, for example by improving governance, inspection and whistle-blowing mechanisms. It will also engage charities and businesses to help them identify and tackle entryist behaviour,” says the new strategy. It will also include an official investigation into the application of Sharia law, new powers to intervene in the activities of faith-based “supplementary schools” and a new “extremism community trigger” to guarantee the police will take seriously complaints from the public about suspected extremists. The details of the published strategy show that the tough package first proposed by the home secretary, Theresa May, back in March has survived largely intact despite objections from no fewer than six of her cabinet colleagues. She has compromised with her cabinet colleagues over her initial proposal to require broadcasters to allow television programmes to be vetted for extremist content before they are broadcast. Instead they will be challenged “whenever extremists have been given a platform to preach harmful messages and falsehoods without critical challenge.” Existing legislation requiring Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, to immediate suspend television services that broadcast unacceptable extremist material is also to be extended to radio services. Also missing from the revised strategy is the previous plan to publish a list of “hate preachers”. Instead the strategy includes previously advertised orders banning extremist groups, closure orders against mosques used by extremists, and ‘disruption orders’ issued against individual named extremists. These orders will mean it is set out clearly for the first time which individuals and organisations the government and the public sector should not engage with. The Home Office has published the full counter-extremism strategy. It’s 40 pages long. You can read it here. I will publish a summary shortly. David Cameron has issued a statement on his Facebook page on today’s counter-extremism strategy announcement. Two: this is, at its heart, a battle of ideas. On one side sit the extremists, with a deliberate strategy to infect public debate, divide our communities and advance their warped worldview. On the other side must sit everyone else – not just the institutions of the state, such as the government, police and security services; but community groups and the rest of society. The extremist narrative needs to be fought every day at the kitchen table, on the university campus, online and on the airwaves. In the end, this battle will only be won through argument and persuasion – people taking a stand to demonstrate the incredible power of our liberal, democratic values, and the emptiness of theirs... Three: while Islamist extremists in no way represent the true spirit of Islam, we cannot ignore the fact that they attempt to justify their views and actions through Islamic scripture and theology. Globally, it is a challenge for all of Islam that a perverted, illiberal and hostile interpretation of this great religion has been allowed to grow. It is a problem that so many see the West as an oppressor, and buy into the grievances, if not necessarily the violence. And it is a worry for the world that some feel allegiance only to a religious brotherhood, instead of to their fellow citizens in nation states. The secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Dr Shuja Shafi, has issued a statement on the anti-extremism announcement saying it is based on “fuzzy conceptions of British values”: ...today’s ‘one nation’ counter-extremism strategy continues down a flawed path, focusing on Muslims in particular, and are based on fuzzy conceptions of British values. It risks being counter-productive by alienating the very people needed to confront Al-Qaeda or Daesh-related terrorism: British Muslim communities. For over 10 years we have had to contend with a misguided ‘conveyor-belt theory’ analysis that conflates terrorism with subjective notions of extremism and Islamic practices. Whether it is in mosques, education or charities, the strategy will reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a ‘compliance’ test to prove our loyalty to this country... ...The measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself... ...We cannot help also detect the McCarthyist undertones in the proposal to create blacklists and exclude and ban people deemed to be extremist. If we are to have such lists at all, they should be determined through a transparent process and subject to judicial oversight to prevent any discrimination and political interference based on pressure from foreign governments... In the Muslim Council of Britain’s view, there needs to be clarity of purpose: is this new policy initiative about tackling alienation, or seeking more securitisation? The former requires long-term capacity building and empowerment of Muslim civil society organisations and addressing structural socio-economic imbalances; the latter is about preventing criminality and enforcing the law. To lump both in one programme of action is not logical. ...these initiatives will not be successful if they perpetuate further alienation of the community and are used to restrict freedom of thought and expression, or to conflate conservative views with violent extremism without any evidence base. The Muslim Council of Britain will be doing its part to explore the issue. While the MCB has not taken government funds towards this, it has consistently spoken out against terrorism. Here’s a round-up of some interesting political stories that you might have missed this morning. The BBC is reporting that Sir Jeremy Heywood, head of the civil service, wrote to government ministers in the run up to the party conference season, warning them against speaking out on the proposals for a third runway at Heathrow. One cabinet minister told the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg that such a move was “unprecedented”. You may recall that David Cameron promised “no ifs, no buts” that there would not be a third runway at Heathrow in 2010, but in July the Davies commission ruled very firmly in Heathrow’s favour. The Telegraph is reporting that six Conservative Cabinet ministers have privately demanded that David Cameron to waive “collective responsibility” in the run-up to the referendum and allow them to campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. A group of cleaners at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been put under disciplinary investigation by their employers after raising the issue of their low pay in a letter to the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond. The 14 cleaning staff were sent letters by the FCO cleaning contractor Interserve asking them to attend an interview that could lead to suspension or punishment, after they signed a joint letter to Hammond suggesting a meeting to discuss the living wage. MPs on the Commons work and pensions committee have warned that pensions could become the next mis-selling scandal if stronger support is not offered to consumers taking up the new retirement freedoms. They said the freedom introduced in April was “not yet operating entirely as it should” – and a lack of clarity was “endangering pension savers”. The Financial Times reports that two devolution deals covering the whole of north-east England with a combined value of more than £1bn are expected to be announced this week. The deals would mean the creation of two more mayors to represent the interests of the area stretching from the Scottish border to the edge of North Yorkshire, bounded by the North East and the Pennine ridge. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver will be giving evidence to the Health select committee this afternoon at around 3.40pm, along side Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of Public Health England. They will be talking about childhood obesity and Oliver will present on his campaign for the introduction of a sugar tax. I’ll try and bring you the highlights later on. The Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron spoke to the Today programme about the Wilson Doctrine earlier this morning. He insisted that he was not in favour of protecting privilege for MPs. I’m in favour of protecting privacy for everybody else and what the Wilson Doctrine was seeking to achieve was to ensure that you could have conversations with journalists. A constituent could blow the whistle to me or any other MP and not be at risk of having their telephone tapped, which in the digital age is a much more likely occurrence.... You should get rid of the Wilson Doctrine if we could replace it with a proper digital bill of rights for everybody. So my privacy is no more important than anybody’s listening to this programme and that’s absolutely critical. Farron predicted that the government was likely to revive the Snooper’s Charter, which the Liberal Democrats blocked in the coalition. My concern is that what government is doing is heading in exactly the opposite direction, that if they bring back the Snooper’s Charter, which is what they are planning to do ... If that happens then you’re going to find not only the security services massively hampered by having so much data they won’t be able to find the people they need to find, but you also have a massive blow to traditional British liberties... I take the view that not only is that counter-productive, because if you’re looking for a needle in a haystack, don’t triple the size of the haystack, you should also make sure we understand that when we’re trying to fight against terrorists you don’t go giving away your traditional freedoms that Britain has fought for so hard over the years. Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, home secretary Theresa May insisted that the anti-extremism measures were not about “people having different views”. This isn’t about people having different views; different beliefs. It’s not about people saying things that some people don’t agree with. That debate is part of freedom of speech and that debate is part of our democracy - it underpins our society. What this is about is those whose extremist message is there in order to try and spread hatred and to divide communities. And that can, of course, lead to violence, but it also leads to other harms, as we have seen. May was cross-questioned about the extension of powers to cancel passports. If you talk to, as I have, parents of young people who have been on the path to radicalisation, or perhaps parents, as I have heard from, who have children who have gone out to Syria, some of whom have died out there fighting, then they are saying that they want to see more action taken. They want themselves, within their communities to be able to take more action... I’m not pretending that any of this is easy. Of course this is difficult, but government has a choice here. We can either say ‘well, this is difficult so let’s not do anything’ or we can say ‘well, actually it is difficult, but this is so important that we need to take action.’... When I talk to people in the muslim community who are out there themselves working against extremism they will welcome support and welcome the fact that the government is saying this is an important issue that we need to deal with. May also refused to be drawn into condemning the allegations against former Conservative home secretary Leon Brittan – who was cleared of rape allegations – saying instead that she thought it was important that sexual abuse victims weren’t deterred from coming forward. The decisions in relation to looking into allegations are for the police to take. Somebody had come forward with an accusation and what we have seen in recent months and continuing is more people coming forward with allegations of sexual abuse of various sorts ... I think it’s very important that we allow people to come forward with their allegations. Good Morning. David Cameron is due to launch his anti-extremism strategy this afternoon as well as making the case for two new pieces of law – the investigatory powers bill and a counter-terrorism bill. As part of the overall strategy, he will extend the powers of parents to cancel their children’s passports if they are worried that their children may be about to travel to Syria or Iraq to join Islamic State. The powers that currently apply to under-16s will now be rolled out to all those under-18. There will also be new measures to automatically bar convicted terrorists from working with children and vulnerable people. Cameron will also announce that suspected jihadi returning from Syria and Iraq will be forced to attend classes to address their support for extremist ideology. Home Secretary Theresa May has just been speaking on Today and I’ll bring you a summary shortly. There will be an emergency debate on the Wilson Doctrine – a convention that the UK’s intelligence agencies will not eavesdrop on members of parliament – after around 2.30pm. The Psychoactive Substances Bill will get its second reading after that. I’ll be covering for Andrew this week, bringing you breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Npower announced earlier in July that it was scrapping its domestic green electricity tariff for new customers, while EDF, E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power are also no longer offering a domestic green tariff for those wishing to switch. With all but one of the big six energy companies offering no 100% renewably sourced electricity tariff to new customers, the choice for consumers who are keen to support green electricity has been drastically reduced. The development was \"very disappointing\", said Ed Gill, head of external affairs at Good Energy, which offers 100% renewably sourced tariffs. He said: \"This is not in the interests of consumers, or the UK more widely. We need to be calling for the big six - who sell some 90% of all electricity – to take responsibility for offering consumers a green tariff if we are to meet our UK targets and address energy and climate change issues. We are all for competition in this market place. But when the government called on energy providers to simplify their tariffs, this was presumably not what they had in mind.\" The companies which have dropped the tariffs for new customers said they have made the changes as part of a review of their products and alongside low levels of interest from customers, and claim to offer alternatives. French-owned EDF Energy, for example, which withdrew its green tariff from sale in October 2012, said in a statement that it \"remains committed to contributing towards a diverse, low-carbon generation mix. EDF Energy encourages customers to sign up to products that are low-carbon backed. The company's suite of \"blue\" products offer a guarantee that the electricity a customer uses will be matched by low carbon electricity generated by nuclear power stations. More than 1.4m energy accounts have switched to blue since its launch in April 2012.\" A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: \"We're making bills easier to understand, cutting the confusing array of tariffs currently on offer, and getting people off poor-value dead tariffs. A number of green tariffs remain on offer for consumers who wish to choose them, including many with smaller suppliers outside of the big six. Our reforms to the electricity market will mean increasingly far more of the power consumers use will come from green energy sources.\" The disclosure underlines further tensions between the government and energy providers over the cost and future direction of green energy policies. Last week Npower published research predicting that the average household bill will rise £240 to £1,487 by 2020, saying this was driven largely by the mounting cost of government green policies. Npower claimed energy company profits were not to blame for rising bills and said consumers should know the true cost of government investment in greener forms of energy production and efficiency programmes, which it said will be the main driver behind a rise in bills from £1,247 today to £1,487 by the end of the decade. Ministers rejected the claim, saying rising gas prices were the key driver and that efficiency measures would offest rises. Also last week the consumer group Which? called on the government to launch an independent review of the energy sector similar to the Vickers report on banking as part of a bid to break the dominance of the 'big six' power providers and rein in soaring household bills. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said there was a need for more transparency in costs: \"Hard-pressed consumers consistently tell us that the spiralling cost of their energy bills is one of their top financial concerns. Suppliers often blame price rises on an increase in wholesale costs, but it is impossible to work out if the price we're paying is a fair one.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/22/china-hydroelectric-dam-three-gorges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T13:01:21Z","webTitle":"China sweeps aside civilians in rush for hydropower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/china-hydroelectric-dam-three-gorges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/22/china-hydroelectric-dam-three-gorges","fields":{"headline":"China sweeps aside civilians in rush for hydropower","bodyText":"The great grey wall cuts across the valley of the Jinsha river, a tributary of the Yangtze. Downstream from the dam, the yellow water gushes down the spillway from China's third most powerful hydroelectric plant. It races on past the city of Xiangjiaba, on the border between the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, a featureless place with a maze of factories and chimneys built into the urban fabric. Its only claim to fame is the wall 200 metres high that now overshadows it. The structure, into which 14bn cubic metres of concrete have already been poured, is due to be completed next year. Fitted with an impressive boat lift, it will drive eight giant 800MW turbines, currently the largest in the world. Xiangjiaba is no match for the array of 32 turbines on the massive Three Gorges Dam, with installed capacity of 22,000MW. But it does confirm China's enthusiasm for hydroelectric facilities, including really big ones, regardless of the environmental cost – in climate disruption and landslides –and the number of people displaced to make way for the work. According to official figures, the Xiangjiaba structure entailed the departure of more than 100,000 people. On 28 September a new invitation to tender was published, for 16 1,000MW turbines, though it is not known for which dam they are intended. No single structure has ever delivered so much power. Following the publication of China's 12th five-year plan (2011-15), the state council set a goal for energy policy, including ambitious hydropower targets. The challenge of boosting renewable energy to a 15% share of the country's primary energy consumption depends largely on hydropower. The prime concern is to reduce pollution from coal-fired power stations, which is poisoning the atmosphere of Chinese cities. At present coal accounts for a much larger share of the energy mix than solar, wind or even nuclear power. Just doubling hydropower (from 190,000MW to 380,000MW) would give renewables a 10% overall share. In theory, on completion of this titanic effort, just over 70% of China's total hydropower potential would be exploited, according to the International Hydropower Association's (IHA) annual report published in April. Further upstream on the Jinsha another wall is going up at Xiluodu. With 13,600MW nameplate capacity, it will be substantially larger than Xiangjiaba. \"Every year the Chinese increase their hydropower capacity by 15GW,\" says Yves Rannou, the head of the China division at Alstom, the French engineering firm, a figure the IHA confirms for 2012. This is an impressive achievement compared with new capacity being built in other parts of the world, apart from Asia: 1.9GW in North America, 1.8GW in South America, 0.5GW in Europe and 0.3GW in Africa. It should be borne in mind that France, for instance, has a total hydropower capacity of 25GW. Downstream from the Xiangjiaba dam, on its righthand side, a tunnel disappears into the rock face. It leads to a cavity like the nave of a cathedral, filled by a dull roar. Without waiting for the structure to be finished, the Jinsha is already driving four Alstom turbines and their generators. They were brought up the river on barges as far as a quay just below the dam. The four monsters, each weighing more than 2,000 tonnes, were manoeuvred into position by suitably gigantic cranes, mounted on tracks that run down to the riverside. On 17 September Alstom officially opened a new hydropower industrial site in Tianjin, north-east China. Airbus operates a large assembly unit on the same technology park. The engineering firm is keen to consolidate its position in this booming market. At the ceremony, CEO Patrick Kron predicted that between now and 2035 half of the world's new hydropower plants would be built in China, with south-east Asia accounting for 85% of the total. He added that hydropower was \"clean, renewable and particularly easy to store\". Though hydropower represents a relatively small share of Alstom's revenue (10%), growth on this scale justifies the €100m ($130m) investment the firm has made in China, in the larger context of cutbacks. \"We need to streamline our operations. But we can do it, even in China, without adopting a strategy of retreat,\" Kron explained on the sidelines of the ceremony. The French firm is by no means the only one interested by the turbine and generator part of future hydropower plants. Its rivals Andritz and Voith, respectively from Austria and Germany, are also on the lookout for work. Voith markets integrated solutions comparable to Alstom's technology. It has a factory in Shanghai, originally built as part of a joint venture with Siemens and Shanghai Electric Corporation. Voith now owns an 80% share of the undertaking and is quick to point out that it equipped China's very first hydropower facility, at Shi Long Ba, in 1910. But foreign engineering firms have little room for manoeuvre. For example, Xiangjiaba's four other hydroelectric units have been produced in China. Two powerful firms, Harbin Electric and Dongfang Electric, which together claim a 40% share of Chinese-installed capacity (as against 20% for Alstom) have become serious competitors, after learning the trade from foreign partners. Asked to compare the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and French suppliers, the head of the China Three Gorges Corporation, which is operating the Xiangjiaba dam, Nie Yuanlong, smiled politely before noting that Alstom's prices were \"slightly higher\". Quality, a key selling point for both Voith and Alstom, may enable them to maintain a slight strategic lead over Harbin and Dongfang in the struggle to deliver increasingly powerful hydroelectric units. But with heavy industry in China plagued by surplus capacity, unlikely to improve if domestic growth slows, competition could well be increasingly fierce.

It is tempting to portray the event to mark the final closure of Dounreay as symbolic after the announcement on Thursday that the two German energy companies E.ON and RWE were pulling out of one of the country's biggest nuclear building projects, the second such decision in recent months. But are commentators right to suggest the country's policy has been plunged into disarray? E.ON said the decision to sell its 50% stake in Horizon Nuclear Power, which is building nuclear reactors at the Wylfa plant in north Wales and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, followed a strategic review, and it hoped to find new owners for the venture. \"We believe that for the right company Horizon remains an attractive project,\" added Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON UK. Charles Hendry, the energy minister, moved quickly to reassure the wider industry, saying: \"The partners have clearly explained that this decision was based on pressures elsewhere in their businesses and not any doubts about the role of nuclear in UK's energy future. Horizon's sites offer new players an excellent ready-made opportunity to enter the market.\" In its favour, new nuclear power has had support from the coalition and the previous Labour administration, as well as an increasingly vocal faction of the environment movement, which traditionally led opposition. The government is also deciding what to do with nuclear waste in England, and appears to have found a financial support mechanism to get around the repeated promise not to give subsidies to the nuclear industry by offering a guaranteed minimum price to all low carbon energy. Just last month it appeared to be riding a high when David Cameron visited France and signed a civil nuclear co-operation pact which included a commitment from the French firm EDF to set up a £15m training centre in Somerset to prepare workers to build a new generation of power plants. E.ON and RWE's decision will be partly blamed on an anti-nuclear backlash in Germany over the continuing danger of high level radiation leaking from the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan following the factor-9 earthquake last year. Robert Gross, an energy policy expert at Imperial College London said other concerns could have been delays in projects in Finland and France, and \"possibly wavering\" by the UK government over its commitment to low carbon energy after high profile political questions over wind farms and a marked increase in support for building new gas turbines. \"I can imagine a scenario where gas prices have [dropped] and nuclear was falling behind and very big, and the whole thing started to look rather unattractive,\" he added. It is too soon to dismiss the nuclear strategy with all parties committed to cutting carbon emissions by 80% by the middle of this century, and plans for more nuclear new build when the first new reactors have been commissioned and built. But the announcement will be a reminder to ministers that they cannot be complacent about their commitment when relying on private money to build essential national infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2014/jan/24/shinzo-abe-japan-new-dawn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-24T15:19:39Z","webTitle":"Shinzo Abe: a new dawn is breaking over Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jan/24/shinzo-abe-japan-new-dawn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jan/24/shinzo-abe-japan-new-dawn","fields":{"headline":"Shinzo Abe: a new dawn is breaking over Japan","bodyText":"For years, pundits called Japan the land of the setting sun. They said that for an economy as mature as Japan's, growth would be impossible. They said that our public debt was unsustainable. They pointed to our supposed psyche of resignation as a symptom of relative decline. But now such voices are rarely heard. Japan's economy has swung from negative to positive growth and is on the verge of breaking free from chronic deflation. This spring, wages will increase – a long overdue development that will lead to greater consumption. Our fiscal position has also improved steadily, with my government on track to consolidate public finances. And, as the economy has turned around, Japan's people have become more vibrant and upbeat – a mood reflected in public enthusiasm over the choice of Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. So it is not twilight, but a new dawn, that is breaking over Japan. And that is because we have overcome the notion that certain reforms could never be carried out. I have maintained that I am willing to act like a drill bit, strong enough to break through the solid rock of vested interests. And so we have. For example, we will completely liberalise Japan's electricity market. By the time the Olympians arrive in six years, the power sector will be fully competitive, with electricity generation separated from distribution. We will also foster medical care as an industry. Japan is on the forefront of regenerative medicine, and we will make it possible to generate stem cells at private-sector labs. And I have just proposed additional reforms, because we also need large-scale health-care providers in the form of holding companies, much like America's Mayo Clinic. Moreover, we are eliminating the \"rice production adjustment\" system, which has been in place for more than 40 years. Barriers to private companies' entry into the agricultural sector will be removed, and farmers will be allowed to grow the crops they want, without official control over supply and demand. Soon, our deregulation package will be set in motion. Over the next two years, in designated areas, no vested interests will remain impervious. For example, in Japanese cities aspiring to world-class status, limits on floor space will become a thing of the past. We will soon see high-quality housing, business complexes, and zero-emissions towns appearing, one after another. Likewise, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will remain a central pillar of my economic policies, and we will press ahead with the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement. As a result, Japan's economy will become even more deeply integrated into global flows of knowledge, trade, and investment. Companies and people from abroad will find Japan among the most business-friendly places in the world. Japan's management of public funds – such as the Government Pension Investment Fund, which now holds about $1.2 trillion – will also undergo far-reaching change. We will press ahead with reforms, including a review of the GPIF's portfolio, to ensure that public funds contribute to growth-nurturing investments. We must also make our corporate taxes internationally competitive. In April, the tax rate on companies will fall by 2.4 percentage points. And we will put in place tax incentives aimed at encouraging companies to use their cash for capital investment, research and investment, and wage increases. At the same time, we will reform labour-market rules that tie workers to old industries. New industries require innovative and creative human resources, and we will redirect our subsidies so that workers without meaningful employment in declining industries can move on and find rewarding work in rising sectors. Of course, given that Japan's population is rapidly aging, and the number of children is falling, investors find themselves asking an obvious question: \"Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs?\" Arianna Huffington once quipped that if Lehman Brothers had been \"Lehman Brothers and Sisters,\" the firm would have survived. Japan's corporate culture is even more male-dominated – a world of pinstripes and button-downs. I was greatly encouraged when Hillary Clinton told me that Japan's GDP could be 16% larger if women participated in the labour market at the same rate as men. Indeed, Japan's female labour force is the economy's most underused resource. Japan must become a place where women shine. By 2020, we want women to occupy 30% of leading management positions – a goal that presupposes a more flexible working environment, as well as support from foreign workers to take over domestic and personal services. A major impetus for change will come in the form of legal reforms, to be introduced at the next parliamentary session, that will increase the number of external directors on corporate boards. Next month, we will also propose a stewardship code that will enable institutional investors to play a greater role in corporate governance. I am confident that the combined effect of these reforms will enable Japan to double its inward direct investment by 2020, rebooting the entire country and changing its economic landscape dramatically. But there is still much to do. Soon, three years will have passed since the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan on 11 March 2011, causing the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While the recovery is far from complete, the love and compassion reflected in the world's response touched us deeply, as has the survivors' spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship. It is in the same spirit that Japan is now set to contribute even more positively to world peace and development. In our age, no single country can preserve peace by itself. None of us alone can solve the challenges that the world faces without helping one another. In Cambodia, for example, a Japanese-built hospital for mothers and newborns has helped to reduce the country's infant-mortality rate. In the Philippines, Japan's Self-Defense Forces mounted a major relief effort after the devastating typhoon in November. And our servicemen and women based in Djibouti remain on high alert against piracy, protecting ships from around the world. Japan is surrounded by neighbours with unlimited possibilities: China, South Korea, the ASEAN countries, India, Russia, and, across the Pacific Rim, the TPP partner countries. Indeed, with Asia becoming the engine driving the world economy, the need to achieve lasting peace and prosperity has never been greater, because the global knock-on effect of any threat to regional stability would be enormous. The foundation underpinning prosperity is freedom of movement for people and goods. On sea-lanes, in air space, and now in outer space and cyber space, freedom of movement must remain secure. The only way to maintain these indispensable public goods is by rigorously upholding the rule of law and promoting fundamental values like freedom, human rights, and democracy. There is no alternative. Asia's growth dividend must not be wasted on military expansion. We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital, which will further boost growth in the region. As is true elsewhere, trust among Asian countries is crucial for their peace and prosperity, and this can be achieved only through dialogue and adherence to international law, not through force or intimidation. In order to create a region of trust and order, I would like to appeal to Asia and the world. To prevent unchecked military expansion in Asia, defence budgets should be made completely transparent, with verifiable public disclosure. Moreover, Asian governments should create a mechanism for crisis management and strong communication channels among our armed forces. We must also establish rules that promote behaviour based on international maritime law. Only then can we achieve lasting growth and prosperity in Asia, enabling all of us in the region to realise our great potential. Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war, and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace. It is my fervent hope that Japan's economic revival, with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity, will help to bring such a world closer. • Shinzo Abe is Prime Minister of Japan Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/18/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-martin-kettle","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-18T18:55:01Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg, like Oliver Twist, wants more.

But he seeks power not soup","bodyText":"Nick Clegg's message could hardly be plainer. Like Oliver Twist, he wants some more. But Clegg wants more power, not another helping of soup. He began his Glasgow conference speech by telling the Liberal Democrats: \"We are a party of government now.\" And he ended it by saying: \"Our place is in government again.\" His appetite is unmistakable. If Clegg remains in government after the 2015 election, whether with Labour or the Conservatives, the Glasgow speech's unsparing focus on another five years in power will seem in retrospect to be a formidable act of leadership. If that happens, Clegg will have turned the Lib Dems in less than a decade from a permanent protest party into an indispensable party of government. On Wednesday, while quietly burying any notion that he stands for the realignment of the left and centre of which Roy Jenkins (and the Manchester Guardian of CP Scott) always dreamed, Clegg instead gave his party something more immediate to focus on – power. Many will retort that he is living in dreamland. Wednesday's YouGov survey had his party on a mere 9% in the polls, down from 24% in the last general election. Last week, just 4% of voters declared themselves certain to vote Lib Dem in 2015. In local government byelections last week, two Lib Dem candidates scored 31 and 32 votes respectively. Party membership is lower than it has ever been – 42,000 and sliding, less than the population of Salisbury. If Clegg was a football manager he would have been given the boot long ago. A lesser leader might be tempted to pull up the duvet and scream. But Clegg seems to take the first world war general Ferdinand Foch as his model. During the battle of the Marne in 1914, Foch sent his superiors the dauntless message: \"My centre is giving way, my right is retreating, situation excellent, I am attacking.\" And by attacking he won. Clegg adopted Foch tactics in his speech on Wednesday. On every side, there is evidence of a wipeout. So Clegg gave his party the order to attack. Only they can stand up for both a stronger economy and a fairer society, he said. Labour would wreck the economy without our steadying hand. The Tories would fuel inequality without our decent values. This 2013 party conference has always been marked down in his diary as potentially the most difficult of the current parliament – the one in which the excitement of government would have worn off, the economic austerity measures would be still biting, the election results continuing to tank, but without the enforced discipline of 2014's pre-election mood. This year, if any year, might be the year in which a challenge to Clegg's leadership might gain traction. In the event, Clegg can rarely have had a better conference. He won all the key votes on the party's lightning rod issues – economic recovery, a 50p tax band, Trident replacement and nuclear power. Of his rivals, Chris Huhne is gone and Vince Cable has been marginalised, while the next generation waits on events. In Glasgow, Clegg was master of all he surveyed. But how far is the field worth surveying? Is he Napoleon in Egypt, a leader framed in the spotlight of history? Or Napoleon on Elba, drilling his diminished army amid the debris of his delusions? Party conference speeches are often accorded more importance than they deserve. Clegg is not a great orator, and does not pretend to be. But his political message was utterly clear. He told the conference that the Lib Dems have done good things – the announcement about school meals for infants was a spin doctor's dream for a party that has had very few good headlines in the last three years – and have stopped bad things. They have made a difference. And the party agrees, with fewer dissenting voices than ever. Clegg's biggest achievement may in the end be to have turned the Lib Dems into a party of pragmatists. In the conference bubble by the Clyde this week, Clegg has cut an impressive figure. On Wednesday he made clear that he knows what he wants. He took on and defeated a series of challenges. He persuaded his party to stay the course with a rationally constructed argument that it will all be worth it and that coalition is the new normal. Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband would envy Clegg his poll ratings, but they must surely envy him his command over his party. Will anyone not at the Glasgow conference notice? Clegg undoubtedly had an impressive week. If nothing else, he is safe until 2015. But as Scotland's great poet Robert Burns famously asked: \"O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us / To see oursels as ithers see us!\" The people's verdict might not be so kind as that of the political class."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2011/jun/16/iea-international-energy-agency-fears-loss-of-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-16T14:37:33Z","webTitle":"International Energy Agency fears higher emissions if nuclear power is cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/16/iea-international-energy-agency-fears-loss-of-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jun/16/iea-international-energy-agency-fears-loss-of-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"International Energy Agency fears higher emissions if nuclear power is cut","bodyText":"The International Energy Agency has warned that the world faces higher energy costs, more carbon emissions and greater supply uncertainty if it turns its back on nuclear power.

The IEA previously believed nuclear would generate 14% of all electricity by 2035 but this figure is under revision in the light of Germany and Japan abandoning the sector following the Fukushima crisis. This week, in a referendum, Italy also voted overwhelmingly – and against the advice of Silvio Berlusconi's government – to reject any return to nuclear power. \"If nuclear is not 14%, but say 10%, then it means more gas and more coal as well as more renewables,\" said Tanaka at a World of Energy prize-giving ceremony on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. \"It will cost much more, be less sustainable and there will be less security. These are the consequences of lower nuclear.\" The IEA says Germany faces a big challenge to achieve its goal of replacing a significant part of its nuclear power generation with wind and solar. The Berlin government says it wants 35% of its power to come from renewables by 2022, with a huge rise in offshore wind from the North Sea and more solar from the south. Laszlo Varro, head of the IEA's gas, coal and power division, said the targets could be reached, given the affluence and sophistication of the Germany economy – but there would have to be an expensive upgrading of the infrastructure to handle a much more diverse and geographically spread power supply. \"Our view is that reaching its goals without nuclear is not impossible but it will be more challenging and more expensive.\" The IEA believes the real future of nuclear – and global carbon emissions – will be fought out in China, India and Russia. They account for 80% of prospective new atomic power plant projects and the first two of these countries are heavily dependent on coal. Russia mainly uses gas for generating electricity. Varro said all three governments had made statements backing up their commitment to nuclear power but most independent experts predict the scale of projects will slow. China has just seen a couple of successful stock market flotations of wind power companies with investors convinced that Beijing will also look more to renewables, having had its confidence shaken by the Japan disaster. A new IEA report, Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2011, published on Thursday shows Chinese demand playing an important role in driving carbon fuel demand. The agency, set up following an earlier oil price crisis, says it expects global oil demand to grow by 1.2m barrels a day annually to 2016. World gas needs could increase by 500bn cubic metres – about two and a half times Russia's current annual exports – over the same period. The IEA, a consistent pessimist on \"peak oil\" speculation, said it was confident that crude supply could keep up. The organisation believes that 1.1m barrels of net new supplies will be unlocked annually from Iraq and Angola but also from outside Opec, Brazil and Canada. These assumptions are based on oil costing on average $103 a barrel – considerably below where it is today but $20 higher than in the same report last year. The world under this scenario will be more dependent on carbon-heavy oil, such as the tar sands of Alberta, Canada. The IEA says only if the shale gas successes of North America are repeated in China and elsewhere will future gas supplies not come from new environmentally sensitive regions such as the Arctic. The organisation denies that \"fracking\", the controversial method of pumping chemicals into the ground to deliver up gas, should be dangerous. Equally it says it supports Arctic drilling if it is done carefully and with full regard to the environment as happens in Norway. Charlie Kronick, a senior adviser on energy at Greenpeace, said: \"Energy is going to get more expensive irrespective of what happens in the world of nuclear power because companies like BP, Shell and Exxon are moving into more deepwater drilling, the Canadian tar sands, and now the Arctic. Oil in these places is inevitably more expensive as well as riskier to extract.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/09/fukushima-reactors-nuclear-free-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-09T15:56:20Z","webTitle":"How Fukushima is leading towards a nuclear-free Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/09/fukushima-reactors-nuclear-free-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/09/fukushima-reactors-nuclear-free-japan","fields":{"headline":"How Fukushima is leading towards a nuclear-free Japan","bodyText":"The Fukushima accident will achieve in the next few months what has eluded campaigners for decades: the closure of every one of Japan's nuclear reactors. The closures, prompted by the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant a year ago, have continued as more reactors are taken offline for inspections. All must pass recently introduced two-stage \"stress tests\" and win local approval before they can be restarted. If, as expected, the last two working reactors are shut down for maintenance by the spring, Japan will be left without nuclear-generated power during the sweltering summer months, when electricity demand peaks. The question is when, or if, the reactors will restart amid a hardening of public attitudes towards nuclear energy in the aftermath of Fukushima, and a new enthusiasm for investment in renewable energy. Japan lost its most prominent anti-nuclear activist last summer with the resignation of Naoto Kan, the prime minister during the early days of the crisis, partly under pressure from other MPs angered by his green conversion in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Kan's successor, Yoshihiko Noda, has said only that Japan needs to gradually reduce its dependence on nuclear energy and improve safety. Under pressure from industry leaders who say a power crunch could damage productivity, Noda is known to want some idle reactors to go back online as soon as their safety has been confirmed. He has at least acknowledged that the government had been guilty of placing too much faith in the myth of safety surrounding nuclear power. \"We can no longer make the excuse that what happened was unpredictable and outside our imagination,\" he told foreign journalists last week. \"Crisis management requires us to imagine what may be outside our imagination.\" Japan, the world's third-largest industrialised country, is paying a heavy economic price for the de facto phasing out of nuclear power. This is in the form of a dramatic rise in imports of oil and gas that not only threaten Japan's climate change goals but were behind 2011 trade deficit, its first in more than three decades. If none of the closed reactors is restarted by early May, Japan's growing dependence on fossil fuels could add more than $30bn a year to its energy costs, according to the government. Before the Fukushima accident, a third of the country's energy came from nuclear, and there were plans - abandoned after Fukushima – to boost its share to more than 50% by 2030 with the construction of new reactors. But after the Fukushima accident passed its most critical phase, the government moved to address public criticism of the Tepco and industry regulators by announcing reforms to the utility's management structure and a new nuclear watchdog - separate from the trade industry - that will start work this spring. \"The first step towards more government involvement in the nuclear industry is turning steps required towards handling severe nuclear accidents into law and requiring utilities to adhere to them,\" the environment minister, Goshi Hosono, said last month. \"I don't think Japan will, or should, sacrifice the safety of nuclear power to ensure a stable source of electricity. Our stance needs to be that we will only allow the minimum number of nuclear reactors to operate under the extremely strict guidelines.\" But many are sceptical of claims that the Fukushima accident was an aberration. A poll by the public broadcaster NHK showed that nearly 70% of Japanese wanted to reduce or end the use of nuclear power, although another survey by the Nikkei media group showed support for the restart of reactors to meet short-term needs at 48%. Significantly, the Mainichi Shimbun this week became the first major newspaper to come out in favour of ditching nuclear power. \"The illusion of nuclear power safety has been torn out by the root,\" it said. \"The Fukushima nuclear disaster that followed the great waves of 11 March last year made sure of that.\" Tomas Kaberger, a member of the Swedish energy agency who was appointed to lead a renewable energy foundation set up by the Softbank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, believes the Fukushima accident has ruled out even a modest a return to nuclear power. \"There is a lot of resistance in the existing power structures, but the combined desire for economic competitiveness and the public opposition to continue as before and in favour of more sustainable and efficient energy supply, I think, will win in the end,\" he said. \"It is only a matter of time.\" Japan proved it could continue to function during the energy-saving regime enforced in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima accident. If, as the environment minister Yukio Edano has suggested, it manages to last the summer without widespread disruption to the power, more people will be asking why the temporary nuclear shutdown can't be made permanent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/oct/18/prices-cameron-energy-mess-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-18T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Rather than prices, David Cameron should fix the energy mess | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/18/prices-cameron-energy-mess-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/18/prices-cameron-energy-mess-power","fields":{"headline":"Rather than prices, David Cameron should fix the energy mess","bodyText":"David Cameron's way of running the country becomes ever more eccentric. This week he was like a dyspeptic columnist. On Wednesday he raged about soaring energy prices, leapt up in the House of Commons and said he would \"pass a law\" against them. That is the joy of being a Blairite prime minister. Margaret Thatcher would have spent hours fussing over how to do what she said. Cameron just blurts it out and leaves others to cope with the mess. All hell broke loose. The prime minister told the Commons he would legislate \"so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers\", not just the 25% who now opt for it. There were gasps all round. Whitehall officials had to burn the midnight oil \"clarifying\" what on earth the prime minister meant by thus denying choice. By morning a lexicographical genius decided that \"have to\" did not imply compulsion. A junior minister, John Hayes, said merely that \"a number of options are under consideration\", though by the day's end this was re-clarified as meaning a big stick. That is what happened a year ago, when Cameron did the same thing, summoning the energy bosses and telling them he was frightfully cross. They smiled, shook him by the hand and increased prices 13%, with a further 6-9% this year. Most of them are foreign-owned and really do not mind what a British prime minister says. Some might see this as rather humiliating, but Cameron is cut from original cloth. He does not rule but muses, suggests, stirs the pot; free of interfering staff work or research. Like Carroll's Queen of Hearts he reverses causality, with decision first, consultation afterwards. We have seen it over planning, health, airports, family taxes, forests, high-speed trains, Europe, everything. Each is followed by a review, a U-turn, a committee, perhaps a postponement until the next election. Hence his enthusiasm for that jewel of dilatory government, the independent inquiry. Cameron is right that months of hollering about utility prices and confused charging systems have yielded nothing but higher charges. Falling world gas and coal prices are not being reflected in falling domestic costs, but the reverse. Regulated privatisation has not worked. As far back as 1987 Thatcher's aide Ferdinand Mount remarked that \"the regulators have no teeth and the operators no conscience\". Eight years later, the then Ofgas regulator, Clare Spottiswoode, was accused of producer capture. She told parliament she was \"wholly unaccountable\" and her reports \"not worth the paper they are printed on\". Not much has changed, except that producer capture has got worse. Massive profits have brought foreign owners running. Coherent planning of long-term capacity has collapsed, victim of a not-so-civil war between government and the industry. On the one side are greedy but confused power companies, on the other ministers in thrall to lobbyists created by their own subsidies. The energy minister, Ed Davey, like his predecessor, Chris Huhne, seems at times to be reading out press releases from wind farm lobbyists, as do his colleagues on nuclear. There is no way privatisation can determine where energy should come from after most coal and nuclear power stations close over the next decade. Britain, unable to take important decisions because they require courage, is starting to resemble a third-world country, and facing eventual power cuts. Cameron's exasperation is understandable. Perhaps he should pass a law banning exasperation. This week, the Oxford professor of energy policy, Dieter Helm, publishes an attack on the whole vexed realm of carbon policy. In The Carbon Crunch he does not quarrel with the statistical basis of climate change, only with its policy consequences. These he regards as driven by green faddishness into barking lunacy. Speaking at the Royal Society last week, Helm addressed two contrasting scenarios. If climate change is not urgent, then we can go on arguing, researching and building North Sea windmills and Saharan mirrors until the sacred cows come home. But if warming really is accelerating, and Helm accepts that it is, then there is no time to lose. There is certainly no time to mess about with footprints, windmills and air miles. A crisis is what it says. At present, rising world demand for energy is being met by coal. China, India, Germany, even Britain, are consuming ever more coal. China is building a coal power station every week. The one country not \"dashing for coal\" is the US, because it is dashing for gas, whose emissions per unit of energy are half those of coal. As a result, America's emissions and energy prices are falling compared with the rest of the world. It is the one virtuous player. To Helm, the answer is simple. The only short-term substitute for coal is not nuclear, which takes too long and is too expensive, but gas. Of course, gas is carbon, and we are still far from \"capturing\" its emissions. Of course, building gas stations may prejudice long-term investment in zero-carbon sources of power. Helm is messianic on researching such sources, be they sun, Earth, tide, even nuclear. But all that is over the horizon. Gas is in \"near limitless supply\" and for the world to turn against it merely prolongs dependence on coal and expedites climate change. Helm's other cause is not to attack production but to tax carbon consumption through a straight carbon tax. The money should go into research and carbon capture. It is also wrong to deny poorer consumers the benefit of cheap gas, as now, when we tax every energy bill to cross-subsidise the idling turbine parks of rich landowners. The green lobby \"has a lot to answer for\". At the Royal Society Helm came close to accusing it of driving forward climate change by ignoring gas. I am not qualified to know if Helm is right, but he writes with a convincing passion. He is also rumoured to have the ear of the Treasury, determined to press ahead with a new generation of gas power stations. Certainly Cameron on Wednesday sold an ideological pass. A Tory prime minister was meddling in the market for power to deny choice and fix prices. Will he extend this to petrol, air fares and bank charges? He also as good as admitted that the private sector can never sort out the energy mess. Having \"decided\" what to do on Wednesday, perhaps he can now decide what to do next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2013/aug/04/ageing-nuclear-submarines-sailors-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-04T11:30:11Z","webTitle":"Ageing nuclear submarines could put sailors and public at risk, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/04/ageing-nuclear-submarines-sailors-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2013/aug/04/ageing-nuclear-submarines-sailors-report","fields":{"headline":"Ageing nuclear submarines could put sailors and public at risk, report warns","bodyText":"Britain's ageing hunter-killer nuclear submarines are suffering mounting technical problems that could endanger the safety of sailors and the public, a report from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned. Five Trafalgar-class submarines, between 22 and 29 years old, are running into reliability issues with the reactors that power them, increasing the risk of cracks, pipe failures and radiation leaks. The oldest, HMS Tireless, leaked radioactive coolant from its reactor for eight days in February. At the moment the problems are being effectively managed, says the report from the MoD's internal safety watchdog, the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR). But it has issued a new amber warning that \"attention is required to ensure maintenance of adequate safety performance\". The problems have arisen because the operational lives of Trafalgar submarines have had to be extended to cope with prolonged delays in bringing Astute-class submarines into service to replace them. After billion-pound budget overruns and repeated construction and teething difficulties, only two of seven proposed new submarines are currently in the water. The Royal Navy's five Trafalgar boats, launched between 1984 and 1991, are now all expected to function for up to 33 years, with the last one not being mothballed until 2022. \"As a result, the Trafalgar class are operating at the right hand end of their 'bathtub' reliability curves,\" says the DNSR report. This means that the number of problems being encountered by the boats is increasing steeply as they reach the ends of graphs shaped like baths. \"The effect has been seen in a number of emergent technical issues over the last few years\" which \"can be directly attributed to the effects of plant ageing\", the report says. The report, which covers 2012-13 and was put online by the MoD without any announcement, does not say what any of the technical issues are. But critics point out that they must include the reactor coolant leak sprung by HMS Tireless during operations off the west coast of Scotland on 4 February. The MoD has since said that the leak lasted for 192 hours, including six days at the Devonport naval dockyard in Plymouth. Permission was also given for Tireless to vent radioactive air to the atmosphere, which the MoD said was \"well within the normal permitted limits for discharges to the environment\". According to John Large, an independent expert on nuclear submarine safety, the main risk from ageing was the \"catastrophic failure\" of components in the pressurised reactor system, including circuit pipework and the reactor vessel. Steel becomes more brittle, particularly if it is irradiated, making it more likely to crack, he said. The DNSR report says that the problems facing Trafalgar-class submarines are \"analogous\" to those experienced by Britain's first generation of Magnox nuclear power stations, all but one of which are now shut down. This \"strongly suggests\" that it was cracks in increasingly brittle metal that DNSR was concerned about, Large argued. DNSR had admitted that the Trafalgar submarines posed an increased risk of nuclear accidents, he said. \"It seems as if admirals in Whitehall have overruled nuclear safety by demanding that the remaining elderly boats are held in service as a string-and-sticky-tape stopgap measure.\" Peter Burt, from the Nuclear Information Service in Reading, warned that the longer the submarines remained in service, the greater the risk of mishaps. \"The MoD should not be putting its operational requirements before the safety of submarine crews and members of the public,\" he said. The DNSR report also predicts that the four newer Vanguard-class submarines that carry Trident nuclear warheads are \"likely to exhibit plant ageing effects\" because their lives have been extended to the late 2020s and early 2030s. It repeats earlier concerns about shortage of skilled nuclear staff and the impact of increased privatisation. The MoD stressed that safety was paramount in its activities. \"We would not operate any submarine unless it was safe to do so,\" said an MoD spokesman. \"The report acknowledges that we are taking the necessary action to effectively manage the technical issues raised by the regulator.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jun/24/build-northern-powerhouse-hilary-devey-tim-burgess-george-osborne-nick-clegg","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-24T18:18:01Z","webTitle":"How to build a northern powerhouse: Hilary Devey and Tim Burgess share their vision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/24/build-northern-powerhouse-hilary-devey-tim-burgess-george-osborne-nick-clegg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/24/build-northern-powerhouse-hilary-devey-tim-burgess-george-osborne-nick-clegg","fields":{"headline":"How to build a northern powerhouse: Hilary Devey and Tim Burgess share their vision","bodyText":"Hilary Devey CBE Award-winning entrepreneur I was born in Bolton, built a business in the Midlands, and live in the south, which affords me a unique perspective when it comes to knowing the significance of the north in terms of both British business and culture. The fact that my perspective seems unique – and that we are not overwhelmed with entrepreneurial voices from the north, once the crucible of British industry – is indicative of a number of problems. Two issues need to be addressed: one practical; one attitudinal. Firstly, the existing northern public transport system is a shambles. This needs to be addressed in tandem with any new high-speed rail development, otherwise we are simply creating more problems. Secondly, the north is often considered by southerners to be another country, and the feeling is mutual. To the frustration of many in the north, the British media focuses on London, and there is a corresponding drain of talent southwards. Pride and confidence in the north – on the part of both northerners and southerners – is key to making it a powerhouse. For too long we have had two societies running in parallel, and our strength must come through unity. Never mind exchange programmes for schoolkids to France. I want to see a social programme that begins at school age to ensure that children in London know about Leeds (and vice versa), as much as they do about Lyon or Lille. As with cities, I would love to see some form of business-twinning between northern and southern companies. Without mutual respect and cooperation, no amount of infrastructure development will change the status quo.\" Tim Burgess Singer A northern powerhouse sounds like a description of a Giant Haystacks-style wrestler or something Eddie Waring might say about a rugby league player in the 70s. It kind of seems a bit stuck in the past – some big chuffing coal-munching traction steam thing we'd be given while London runs on some silent future energy. Osborne and Cameron were \"oop north\" on Monday talking about it. They always look a bit scared – like they've accidentally ended up in the tough bit of town – when they're in front of some workers in a treacle factory in a gritty part of the country that they're not that familiar with. They kind of bring their cleansing, efficient business sensibilities where they're not asked for. High-speed links between Manchester and Leeds? It only takes an hour. They have the air of two berks off The Apprentice hustling something they just invented that they know nobody needs. Chuck in Nick Clegg – lost in a black people carrier somewhere shouting into a switched-off phone in the palm of his hand – and the image is complete. Sheffield and Leeds are still getting over the last bright ideas for business that a Conservative prime minister had for their region – I've been to Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds in the last few weeks and they seem to be thriving on the merits and efforts of people who actually live there. I'm sure that everyone would welcome money, investment and help for the future but maybe not from some snake-oil salesmen who are just passing through. Wayne Hemingway Designer and retail expert The idea of a northern powerhouse is one that's been promoted for a long time, particularly by our finest planner Sir Peter Hall. It's just that it's fallen on deaf ears. Whether a government has the ability to deliver it is another matter. London needs to have real competition in the UK – ideas, creativity, club culture, music and film aren't owned by the capital but infrastructure is so heavily focused on the south, it's created a lopsided economy. Look at Germany – it's so much stronger because it has a set of regional cities with strong industries that give people equal opportunities to live and work. I can see the media mischievously playing with the idea of this being one big super northern city stretching from coast to coast, which is a nonsense and misses the point. Having amazing public transport will connect this string of pearls – Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and beyond – and that can only be a good thing. I use public transport a lot, I would never dream of going up north in a car, and it only takes two hours or so to get to Manchester from London, but it can then take you just as long to travel a fraction of the distance to another town. Try getting the 26 miles from Blackburn, a town of 150,000 people, to Manchester; it can take almost 90 minutes and it shouldn't be like that. As told to Nosheen Iqbal Phil Redmond TV producer and founder of Mersey Television One of the great advantages of being born, bred and surviving in the north is that you are forced into accepting a global perspective. On Monday the chancellor was encouraging the north to create a powerhouse to counterweight London. While his argument was superficially persuasive it contained three basic flaws. The first is the idea that large cities are needed for innovation and growth. The second is that the ability to travel between cities is in itself an economic driver. Try telling those things to the 40,000 or so folks that were in Cupertino when Steve Jobs set up shop. Or the 30,000 people in Menlo Park who watched Sergey Brin's and Larry Page's Google start-up. The third flaw was not accepting that cliches only exist because they are true. The north-south divide needs to be recognised for what it is. A simple clash of historical perspectives. And priorities. Given a choice, people prefer to live and work in the same environment. And, usually, where they live. It is people that make a difference. People that make cities. Hence the consequent rise of Silicon Valley and, perhaps ironically, the rise of Ukip and the Scottish romantic dream of Independence. People actually don't want to be a London counterweight. Not understanding this is what continually fuels this situation. Marina Lewycka Novelist Who doesn't want to live in a \"powerhouse\"? It sounds lovely – glitzy skyscrapers looming above the council estates, coffee shops and art galleries springing up where slag heaps used to be. And all this would be achieved by a railway line or two? And electing a showman with a funny hairdo to run the city? Bring it on! But before we get seduced by this vision, let's stop and think. Sheffield used to be an economic powerhouse. In the days of coal and steel, you could see the flames from the blast furnaces leaping up beside the M1 as you drove north; work was hard for miners and steelworkers, but wages were good, transport and housing were cheap, the surrounding countryside was lovely, and there was a strong sense of community. This has all changed, not because local people have become lazy and feckless and too many foreigners have arrived; not even because of Margaret Thatcher. It has changed because our economy, like the whole of Europe, shifted away from manufacturing and toward finance and services, which are concentrated in London. It would be churlish to reject any initiative that would create more and better jobs for local people. The saddest thing about Sheffield today is the way that young people are sucked south in search of better opportunities. But the coalition government's track record (Yes, Nick Clegg, I'm talking about you too) on the local economy is dubious. One of their first acts in power was to cancel an £80m loan (not grant) to Sheffield Forgemasters to enable them to produce extra-large forgings for nuclear power stations, which will now probably be built in France, China or Japan. The austerity package will reduce by 50% Sheffield's grant from central Government by 2015/2016 costing each household £308, as compared with £87 in Windsor or Buckingham. One of Sheffield's biggest \"exports\" is education: overseas students at our two excellent universities contribute £120m to the local economy. Thanks to heavy-handed application of government visa regulations, the number has declined nationally for the first time in years, and overseas students now take their brains and their money elsewhere. Meanwhile, our local utilities, which used to be tied into the local economy, are now all based overseas. I was quite taken aback to discover that the water in my taps comes all the way from the Cayman Islands. I'm all in favour of better transport – I use quite a bit of it myself – but Sheffield, although quite close to Manchester, is cut off by the beautiful but wild Pennines, where even the sheep look lost. I can see that building infrastructure will be great for some of the government's favourite entrepreneurs, but it's no substitute for investment in real industries and skills. Tom Bloxham Chairman and co‑founder of property developer Urban Splash I think the idea of HS3, or certainly improving rails links across the north, is very positive. Going from Leeds to Manchester by train can take me almost as long as going to London - around two hours – and much longer if I go by car and it's congested. The prospect of elected mayors is certainly interesting. But I'm less worried about structure, more about quality. Manchester, for example, doesn't have an elected mayor but Richard Leese (Manchester City council leader since 1996) and Howard Bernstein (chief executive of Manchester City council) are incredibly well thought of, and other places with elected mayors have operated less well. The boundaries we've got are fairly arbitrary (for instance, the line between Machester and Salford, or Manchester and Trafford) and we need to act with greater cooperation. One of the great things we have got are our universities and I think the University of Manchester is a great example, with graphene and various other things. Yet still the majority of research funding goes into the south-east – that's something that could be relatively easily addressed. The vast majority of expenditure on transport has gone south too, with projects such as Crossrail. People would go anywhere to watch the national football team and having it in a fairly badly located Wembley is the sort of thing the government could look to change. The turning point in Manchester wasn't necessarily the IRA bomb, or even the Commonwealth Games. It was when Manchester bid for the Olympics Games. Although we lost – with all the stupid jokes about the shooting being in Moss Side and so on – it gave Mancunians a sense of pride. There were thousands of people celebrating in the street, even though we lost. We realised we weren't competing with Bradford or Birmingham or London for that matter, but Barcelona and Los Angeles and Sydney, and lots of global second cities. The Capital of Culture competition helped to transform Liverpool in 2008, and hopefully it will have a positive effect in Hull. The government has made some positive moves in setting up things like RIO (Regeneration Investment Organisation), which I think has started some good work. But I think more of that could happen. Regeneration almost finished with austerity, four or five years ago. There's much more still to do and I think some modest investment could make a huge difference. As told to Bim Adewunmi Lemn Sissay Author and broadcaster Mary Anne Hobbs of BBC Radio 6 said to me the other day that we are on the edge of a cultural renaissance in Manchester. Twenty five million pounds is being spent on Home, an arts centre to rival the Southbank, directly facing where the Haçienda used to be. The British Film Institute archive is now held in Manchester at the newly refurbished Manchester Library, which opened a week or so ago. Media City has created an exodus of media folks from London. Whitworth Art Gallery has doubled in size and opens in October. Manchester is regrouping, financially and culturally. The space of Manchester has changed. There are Eritreans and Ethiopians here when there weren't 10 years ago. But for me, as somebody from Lancashire, Manchester and other northern cities will only develop if they embrace the other cultures that exist there. Because it is those cultures that make it what it is. Toni Morrison wrote: \"All paradises, all utopias are designed by who is not there, by the people who are not allowed in.\" It's really important that diversity is central to those processes of growth, otherwise they won't happen. We need to see our cities as Cosmopolitan, avant-garde challenges – to find new ways of being. People come to London and say, \"Ooh, everybody's from everywhere.\" Well everybody is from everywhere. You need to embrace that rather than patronise it.

Thundercrack is the grandaddy of Springsteen’s epic journeys and would only be replaced when he wrote Rosalita (Come Out Tonight). The vocals are loose and playful, while behind Springsteen the band are absolutely airtight, a glorious swirl of organ, piano and vocals, plenty of sha-las and whoa-ohs, backed by the unmistakable feel of Vini Lopez on the drums.

By the end of Thundercrack’s almost nine minutes you feel like you’ve been a private guest at a raucous and unpredictable house party, somewhere on the Jersey Shore, standing there barefoot with a cold beer in your hand, all night (as the song says). 2. So Young and in Love Springsteen’s core sound is based on the music he loved when growing up, but on this track he wears his heart visibly and proudly on his sleeve. He makes no bones about channelling his idols here: he is Wilson Pickett, Sam Moore and Jackie Wilson, strutting his stuff along the edge of a stage in a dark nightclub, jacket slung over his shoulder as he works the adoring crowd. This song swings, pure and simple, thanks to the rhythm section, all solid bass and hi-hat; it’s a delightful melange of sax and keyboards and hearty backing vocals, from when all the members of the E Street Band had microphones. (It’s believed this track was recorded just after Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan joined the band in August 1974, answering a Village Voice ad for musicians that specified: “All must sing.”) There are rat traps and soul crusaders (predating the ones we’d meet later on Night, from Born to Run), and more than anything else, the performance captures the emotions implied by the song’s title. 3. Roulette Springsteen was in the studio for over a year across 1979 and 1980 while recording The River, and as a result there were piles of outtakes left over, some of which might have been better than the songs that made it on to the album. Inspired by the Three Mile Island nuclear power-plant incident (it was recorded three days afterwards and was the first song cut during the River sessions), this absolute piledriver of a song is Springsteen at his most dramatic. The full-speed-ahead drum roll at the start of the track is accompanied by an excited, driving voc 3al; the lyrics and phrasing parachute the listener directly into heart of the action; you aren’t allowed to be a casual observer. “We left the toys out in the yard,” he begins, setting a vivid, intense scene that never diminishes. At the end of the last verse, Max Weinberg rides the hi-hat, cueing an almost-breathless Springsteen to lead you through the maze of action to the song’s close. And then that drum roll, reprised from the beginning, slows down like a pulse and fades out at the end. If it sounds insane, that’s because it is. “It would have been one of the best things on the record,” Springsteen told Mojo in 1998. 4. Be True Another River-era outtake, this track would surface on the B-side of the 1980 single Fade Away, a perfect antidote to that song’s plaintive sadness. On the surface it’s a delightful little love song – the narrator telling his girl he’s just as good as the stars she daydreams about – but there’s a deeper theme of not selling yourself short and of getting what you deserve, all tied together with movie metaphors. Musically it’s got the E Street Band at their best in that era, bouncing along with organ and piano at the forefront and Clarence Clemons on the tambourine, before he comes in with a crisp, perfect sax solo at the end. This is another track Springsteen would later say should have been on the album: “I’m sure they [Be True and Roulette] would’ve been better than a couple other things that we threw on there,” he told Rolling Stone in 1988. Like many of Springsteen’s love songs, live – as in the version on our Spotify playlist – he often turns the sentiment around on the audience, exhorting “Is it a deal?” at the end of the last chorus. 5. This Hard Land The country influence that began to appear in Springsteen’s songs as he moved into the 80s should not have been surprising, as his interests, tastes and influences expanded. This Hard Land is a Western movie in five minutes, a story of friendship and brotherhood told through the life of a brother and a sister in the south-west of the US; you can see the dust, feel the saddle, hear the floorboards creaking underfoot. It was written for Born in the USA, wouldn’t have been out of place on Nebraska, and finally emerged live onstage in 1993. It’s almost country but not quite; it’s almost rock but not quite that either. No matter how you want to label it, it’s an absolutely beautiful, rollicking, wide-open song with a gorgeously narrated story. It’s become a special moment in the live show, whether performed with the band or as a solo acoustic encore. When Springsteen closed his 2013 European tour in Kilkenny, Ireland, he was visibly emotional as he sang the last verse: “If you can’t make it — stay hard! Stay hungry! Stay alive! If you can / And meet me in a dream of this hard land.” Reading on mobile? Listen to this playlist on Spotify here 6. My Love Will Not Let You Down If you’re ever at a Springsteen concert and this is the first number, you’re in for a barnburner of a night. On its face this is a love song, a pledge of passion and dedication, but it’s also become a symbol of Springsteen’s promise to the fans, and a thank you for their devotion and commitment. “I got me a promise that I ain’t afraid to make,” he pledges, holding the guitar up against his heart, strumming extra hard for emphasis, underscoring his words. It’s a rhythmic, powerful anthem that’s all guitars, except for Roy Bitttan’s elegant underpinning, and it should be the theme song for the latter-day E Street Band. Manager Jon Landau originally favoured it to open side two of Born in the USA, for which it was originally recorded, before the album took another direction entirely. 7. Seeds As Springsteen’s cultural frame of reference expanded, so did his political and social consciousness, and this was his first attempt to catalyse the latter in his songwriting. Seeds came out of the Born in the USA sessions and is a specific exploration of a specific poverty: another tale of trying to follow the American dream, this time chasing after the oil boom just as it went bust. You feel the anger in the delivery of the lyrics and the rock-solid rhythm, underscored by crunchy and highly satisfying guitar chords courtesy of Nils Lofgren. When it’s in the setlist, it’s for a reason, especially during the Reagan years, where it would feature in a run including Johnny 99, Atlantic City and The River, or in the aftermath of the first Bush presidency where it would stand alongside Youngstown and The Ghost of Tom Joad. It sadly remains as relevant today as it was when he wrote it, but at least that means we’ll get to hear it live for years to come. 8. The Wish After years of Springsteen writing about his stormy relationship with his father, this track about his mother, Adele, emerged during the Tunnel of Love sessions. While the melody is simple, the song’s strength is in its lyrics — the images are bright, beautiful and vivid. You can picture the Christmas tree and the scene during the holidays at the Springsteen household, and that stays with you as the story brings you to the later days of success, wealth and Springsteen’s own start to building a family. It’s the bright flipside to the story told in The Promise, and one he has admitted was about as directly autobiographical as he’s ever been. 9. Seven Angels Even though Springsteen moved into the 90s without the E Street Band, his predilection for a great soul shouter didn’t diminish, despite all the synthesisers. This exploration of the dilemma of a man in love — is this true love? What if I’m wrong? What if I’m right? — is a straight-ahead stomper with a good old-fashioned rock’n’roll rhythm section. Springsteen screams, he sings, he growls, he hollers, he whispers, and makes you feel the various flavours of inner turmoil being voiced in the lyrics. It’s absolutely glorious from beginning to end and a shame it’s never come out in the live show. 10. Back in Your Arms This is the quintessential Springsteen soul ballad, which made its first appearance in the Blood Brothers documentary in 1996. When Back in Your Arms appears in performance it makes the women scream, but it also makes the men in the house turn just a little misty. It’s a heartbreaker, plain and simple, and it’s all about Springsteen’s vocal performance: if it doesn’t make your bottom lip tremble just a little bit, I’m not sure you’re human. There’s some lovely keyboard work from Roy Bittan, which adds the right mood and colour, and Clarence Clemons’s soul sax is the cherry on top."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/05/letter-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-05T11:29:28Z","webTitle":"Industry letter calls for decarbonisation target in energy bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/05/letter-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/05/letter-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill","fields":{"headline":"Industry letter calls for decarbonisation target in energy bill","bodyText":"New jobs and financial investment in the energy sector are at risk if the government does not ensure its imminent energy bill supports low-carbon power, an unusual coalition of the trade bodies representing the renewable energy, nuclear power and carbon capture industries has warned. The letter to the energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, strongly backs the call from the government's climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), to include a reference in the bill for the power sector to be almost entirely decarbonised by 2030. On Saturday, the Observer revealed that the amount of power expected to be generated from gas by 2030 has quadrupled in the last year, raising fears that carbon targets will be missed and low-carbon generation crowded out. The final version of the energy bill, due to bring in the biggest reforms to the energy market in two decades, is expected towards the end of November. The draft version was published in May. The letter signed by the heads of RenewableUK, the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and the Nuclear Industry Association says that a decarbonisation reference would lower \"the perceived political risks, but could also reduce the cost of capital for decarbonising the power sector. We therefore believe that this could be very important for investment going forward.\" The CCC has recommended electricity in 2030 be produced at no more than 50g of CO2/kW by 2030; gas power stations emit around 350g of CO2/kW. The current energy bill draft has no such target. The trade body chiefs, who represent more than 1,000 companies between them, say that any significant delay in the bill \"could result in investment being postponed, with major implications for associated new industrial development and jobs in a high-tech, high growth sector.\" John Sauven, the executive director at Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, took the surprising step of welcoming the letter, saying: \"This letter shows that whilst different industries will have differing preferences for the exact mix of energy technologies, there is unity from across huge swathes of the business community on the need for a clear goal in the energy bill to take carbon almost completely out of the electricity system by 2030.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/mar/09/queen-wants-uk-to-stay-in-eu-so-scotland-doesnt-go-independent-former-cabinet-minister-claims-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-09T18:42:13Z","webTitle":"Government loses Sunday trading vote by majority of 31 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/09/queen-wants-uk-to-stay-in-eu-so-scotland-doesnt-go-independent-former-cabinet-minister-claims-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/09/queen-wants-uk-to-stay-in-eu-so-scotland-doesnt-go-independent-former-cabinet-minister-claims-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Government loses Sunday trading vote by majority of 31 – as it happened","bodyText":"Ministers suffered a serious defeat in the Commons as Conservative rebels lined up with Labour and the SNP to vote down plans to give councils the power to relax Sunday trading laws. A close vote had been expected, but in the event the government lost by a majority of 31 - a much larger margin than forecast. The defeat is particularly embarrassing for George Osborne, the chancellor, who made extending Sunday trading one of the key announcements in his post-election budget last year. Within the last week Osborne has also had to abandon plans for widespread pensions reform. It is David Cameron’s first major defeat of this parliament although, with a normal working government majority of just 16, more are bound to follow. Twenty six Tory MPs voted against the government, Labour whips have claimed. A full voting list will be published later. Ministers have strongly criticised the SNP for voting on a matter that does not directly affect Scotland. The government only lost because of the SNP vote, and Sajid Javid, the business secretary, described their behaviour as “childish and hypocritical”. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. UPDATE: I’ve corrected the first paragraph so it says this was Cameron’s first major defeat of this parliament. Last year he suffered a less significant defeat on “purdah” rules and the EU referendum. The SNP’s Tommy Sheppard intervened on Sajid Javid to say that the SNP were just voting to protect the interests of their constituents. Javid did not accept that. He replied: [Sheppard] should be ashamed of his party’s performance today. He tries to behind a policy, but we know that the only thing the SNP was interested in today was headlines, and denying the people of England and Wales a change that through their MPs they clearly wanted to see. In the Commons MPs are not embarked on the third reading of the enterprise bill. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has just accused the SNP of “childish and hypocritical” behaviour. Brandon Lewis, the communities minister who led for the government in the debate, says the government only lost because of the impact of SNP, who were voting on a law that would not affect Scotland. (At least, it would not affect Scotland directly. The SNP argued that relaxing Sunday trading in England might have a knock-on effect in Scotland, where Sunday opening hours are already more relaxed, but where workers are assured premium pay if they work on a Sunday.) Here is my colleague Rowena Mason’s first take on the government’s defeat. There were 26 Tory rebels, according to the Labour whips. Jeremy Corbyn has welcomed the government defeat. MPs were voting for a cross-party amendment opposing Sunday trading tabled by a Conservative MP, David Burrowes, but the government lost because Labour, the SNP, Tory rebels and some minor party MPs united behind it. This means that Sunday trading has been taken out of the bill. It is a big, significant defeat, on an issue that was particularly championed by George Osborne, the chancellor. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, used a point of order to say Osborne should come to the Commons to make a statement. (There is no indication he will.) The government has lost by 317 votes to 286 - a majority of 31. This is from Labour’s Jon Trickett. The Lib Dems have a free vote on this, apparently. The tellers for the ayes (ie, for the David Burrowes anti Sunday trading amendment) are the Tory MPs Peter Bone and Philip Hollobone. The tellers for the noes are the Conservative whips Guy Opperman and Jackie Doyle-Price. MPs are voting now on the David Burrowes amendment that would remove the plans to relax Sunday trading laws from the enterprise bill - in other words, to kill the Sunday trading plans altogether. Labour’s Caroline Flint says it is clear the government has not made the case for change. In the Commons the Conservative MP Fiona Bruce has just read out an extract from the impact assessment quoted at 5.46pm. In 2014 David Cameron said new government proposals would be subject to a “families test” to consider their impact on family life. The impact assessment published today includes a section looking at how extending Sunday trading would or would not meet the families test. Here is an extract. We have identified three potentially significant impacts on families. There is potentially a positive impact on families from the greater employment opportunities that may result from extending Sunday trading. Financial problems and unemployment can undermine the quality of family relationships and contribute to family breakdown. Sunday work may be particularly valuable as many retailers pay staff a premium to work on Sundays and so workers can work fewer hours and earn proportionally more money ... To the extent that Sundays are family gathering days, there is a potential for families to be negatively affected if members are more likely to work or work longer on Sundays. There are clearly benefits to families where members are working and generating an income. Generally the best judge of whether it is beneficial overall will be those families. However, some respondents expressed that some shop workers would be pressured to work Sundays against the interest of their families ... A positive benefit for families is that they may be able to take advantage of the increased flexibility of being able to shop at larger shops at different hours and for longer. Respondents to public consultation who supported the proposals made these arguments about increased convenience and choice fitting around busy family and working life in the rest of the week ... And here is its conclusion on this point. As these impacts are mixed the overall impact is unclear.A large number of the individual respondents to the public consultation felt that families would be negatively affected. However, this was not a representative survey and we note that a representative poll by IPSOS-MORI carried out in December 2012 found that families with children are more likely to be in favour of extending Sunday trading hours than against. Karl McCartney, a Conservative, says there is something special about Sunday. He wants to protect that. Given the chance, he would go further, he says, and restrict opening on Boxing Day, Good Friday and Easter Monday. Labour’s Helen Goodman says there are lots of things that would make life more efficient, like proposing to our partners by text. But that does not make them desirable. Brandon Lewis, the communities minister leading for the government in the debate, is not impressed by the Labour speeches he has heard. Sir Gerald Howarth, the Conservative MP, said he had “never seen such a shambolic way in which serious legislation affecting our country has been introduced”. And, referring to the way the government produced a compromise amendment today, but too late for it to be put to a vote, Howarth said this “makes the back of a fag packet look like sophisticated engagement”. This Commons briefing paper (pdf) explains in detail how the plans to relax Sunday trading in the bill would work. Here is the key passage. New clause 21 to the Bill amends the Sunday Trading Act 1995 (STA 1994), giving powers to ‘Sunday trading authorities’ to extend opening hours for large shops in England and Wales (with a retail floor area greater than 280 square metres). The extended hours can apply to the whole or part of the local area. For the purposes of this new clause, a ‘Sunday trading authority’ is the local authority for an area. In relation to the area of Greater London, the ‘Sunday trading authority’ is the Mayor of London acting on behalf of the Greater London Authority. New clause 21 also introduces new Schedule 1 in to the Bill containing amendments to the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Employment Act 2002 in relation to Sunday working. The amendments are as follows: to shorten the notice period for opting out of Sunday work in the case of shop workers at large shops, confer a new right to object to working additional hours on Sunday; require employers to give statements explaining those rights, confer protections against detriment and unfair dismissal for refusing to work additional hours on Sunday; and provide for fines in tribunal proceedings if there is a failure to give explanatory statements. The DUP MP Jim Shannon says the Sunday trading plans are an attack on people of faith. Generally the debate has been fairly second-rate so far, but Labour’s David Lammy managed to raise the tone. His speech was probably the best yet. Here are some highlights. My primary concerns are two-fold. First, the protection of family life. Seventy five per cent of parents in this country feel that work impinges on their family life. Many of us have been abroad: we’ve been in Spain or Portugal or France, and we’ve found real restrictions on finding things open on a Sunday. We’ve been out at lunchtime and found that the shops are on siesta. Why is it that in this country this government thinks that we should put the free market above everything else? It is conservative to protect the family and it is worth protecting. When we come to this House and we debate issues like knife crime, when we lament that families have not got time to sit around tables with their children, when we want to see parents supporting their kids to learn to read and with their homework - when do we think that is being done? It is being done on a Sunday. And, then the second point, what is the face of the people that we will be asking to go out and [work]. Think of those security guards now being driven to work on a Sunday. Think of the cleaners. Think of those stacking shelves. They are the face of my constituents. The balance we have in this country is right. To change it through the back door, to allow a domino effect because one local authority has got to make changes because the neighbouring local authority did it, is wrong. And I might say also, to undermine independent shopkeepers, who universally are against this change, must be something we should not support. The Conservative MP Stewart Jackson says he will be voting for the David Burrowes amendment. He says he was very disappointed to see the government’s manuscript amendment on the Sky Twitter feed before it had been shown to MPs. The Labour MP David Lammy says this government puts the market before everything else. It should consider the needs of workers and families. (It is a short speech, but a very good one - easily the best of the debate so far. I will try to post some direct quotes.) Caroline Spelman, the Conservative former environment secretary, is speaking in the debate now. She has tabled her own amendment to the bill. It would allow the relaxation of Sunday trading laws in the spring and summer, and before Christmas, in areas designated “tourist zones”. The idea is based on a law operating in France, she says. Having spoken in the debate, Brandon Lewis, the communities minister, has taken to Twitter to continue his attack on the SNP. YouGov has posted a blog today with details of its polling on Sunday trading. Broadly, more people are in favour than are opposed. But the figures also show that there are concerns about the impact on small shops and on shopworkers. Esterson says Labour MPs will stick to their line. They want to keep the “great British compromise” on Sunday trading, ie the status quo. Labour will back the Burrowes amendment, he says. Esterson says MPs have had less than three hours to consider the government’s impact assessment on this measure. That is an “outrage”, he says. Esterson says, when Sunday trading laws were liberalised during the Olympics, convenience stories lost about 7% of their trade. And, overall, there was no increase in trade, he says. He says that undermines the government’s claim the scheme would create jobs. Esterson says this idea is presented as a move towards localism. But if one borough relaxes Sunday trading laws, the next-door ones will have to follow suit, or face the risk of losing trade. There would be a domino effect, he says. Esterson says the Tories say David Cameron wrote the letter saying that he had no plans to extend Sunday trading when he was head of a coalition government, but that now he has a different view because he heads a Conservative government. But presumably then he aspired to head a Conservative government. Bill Esterson, the shadow business minister, is speaking now for Labour. He says that was a “Trust me, I’m honest” speech from Brandon Lewis. He has never heard anything so absurd, he says. Why didn’t the government make this offer in the first place? He says MPs cannot vote for pilots today. They will have to decide whether to take Lewis’s word on this. The government should come back with a new bill, which could then be properly considered, he says. Lewis says only the 12 areas selected for pilots would be allowed to liberalise Sunday trading in the first year under his compromise plan. Ian Paisley, the DUP MP, suggests the government would do better withdrawing the plan, and bringing back new legislation. Lewis says that is not the plan. The plan is for 12 pilots. There would be an assessment. It would be published. The idea would then come back to parliament, he says. There would be an evaluation, and second vote, he says. Lewis says MPs would get chance for second vote on Sunday trading liberalisation after pilot schemes. Lewis says “thousands and thousands” of new jobs are at stake. Lewis is announcing details of the government’s compromise. The government is going further than planned, he says. And he says it deals with objections raised by the SNP. Instead of applying liberalisation nationwide from day one, it would invite 12 areas to apply to run pilots. They would be geographically and economically diverse. He says if MPs vote against the Burrowes amendment, an amendment for the pilot schemes will be tabled in the Lords. The pilots would allow the impact on workers to be assessed. Jim Shannon, the DUP MP, makes a point of order. He says MPs are being asked to vote on a promise, not on something they have seen in writing. John Bercow says it is acceptable for a minister to promise to do something in the future. But he reminds MPs they will not be voting for the Lewis compromise plan. Robert Jenrick, the Conservative MP for Newark, says one of the biggest employers in his constituency is Knowhow, the distribution company. He says its workers work on a Sunday. How do people think things get delivered on a Monday. This is from the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith. Lewis says the opposition are not just being inconsistent; they are also “killing off jobs”, he says. He says extending Sunday trading would be worth £300m in London alone. The opposition are opposing measures that would help to create jobs, he says. And the SNP need to explain why they are opposed to English councils getting more control over Sunday trading hours when this is a matter fully devolved to Scotland. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, raises a point of order. She asks John Bercow to confirm that there will not be a vote on the late amendment relating to piloting Sunday trading liberalisation. Bercow says it was submitted late, and it was not selected. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP, asks Lewis if the government will retain the protections for workers if it loses the Sunday trading extension vote. Lewis says the government has been clear that this is a package. If Sunday trading liberalisation gets defeated, the other aspects will be lost too. Lewis says two of the government amendments being debated now would extend workers rights. (One would ensure that anyone sacked for refusing to work extra hours on a Sunday would not have to have worked the normal two years to be allowed to take an unfair dismissal case to an industrial tribunal. Another extends what employment tribunals can consider in relation to Sunday trading.) Lewis says that, because the amendments are grouped together, if MPs vote for Burrowes’ rebel amendment, they will be voting against these amendments extending workers’ rights too. The Labour former cabinet minister Andrew Smith says David Cameron said shortly before the election that he had no plans to extend Sunday trading. Lewis says Labour may not want to promote economic growth, but the Conservative manifesto was clear that this is what the government would do. Brandon Lewis, the communities minister, is speaking now. He says it is important to remember why MPs are debating this. The last time the laws on Sunday trading were updated was in 1994. In those days no one had heard of Amazon. If they had, they thought it was a river. Sir Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, says changing Sunday trading laws would be a “fundamental change”. Yet it was not in the Conservative manifesto. Lewis says councils know their areas best. This bill would give them the power to decide to liberalise Sunday trading laws. Around 200 councils asked for the power to do this, he says. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, asks why shopworkers should have to work on Sundays. Lewis says some shopworkers themselves want to shop on a Sunday. Reynolds says his opposition to Sunday trading his partly motivated by his Christianity. Sunday is a special day for Christians, he says. It is a day when he attends church. Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds is speaking now. He is backing the Burrowes amendment. He says is is sponsored by Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union. He says it is “at best mischievous, and at worst borderline fantasy” when the government says the bill does not in itself open the way to Sunday trading. The bill says it would be up to councils to decide if they wanted to extend trading. But, Reynolds says, as soon as one council area liberalised Sunday trading laws, neighbouring councils would be obliged to follow. He says his fundamental objection to the bill is driven by his desire to keep Sunday special. Burrowes has finished. John Bercow says the debate will run for another two hours and 20 minutes. That means the vote will take place at around 5.50pm. Burrowes says he has been told by a worker that the idea that working on a Sunday is voluntary is “laughable”. Employers penalise workers who do not agree to work on Sunday, he says. The Sun’s Craig Woodhouse says that, when he responds to the debate, Brandon Lewis, the communities minister, will say that the compromise amendment produced by the government (see 2.12pm) will be inserted in the bill when it returns to the Lords. It cannot be inserted into the bill today because John Bercow, the Speaker, will not put it to a vote because it was tabled late. Here is the Sunday trading impact assessment published by the government today (pdf). And here is the government’s response to its consultation on its plans (pdf). Burrowes is still speaking in the debate. He quotes from the government’s summary of its response to the consultation on Sunday trading. It said it did not have full data about people’s responses because they responded in their own words. The government’s last-minute compromise amendment has not been selected, which means it will not be put to a vote, Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh reports. Waugh also says David Cameron is calling in Tory rebels for a chat. Labour’s Toby Perkins asks Burrowes how he feels about the fact that this was not in the manifesto. Burrowes says he is a lawyer by trade. That is a “leading question”, he says. The Conservative MP Robert Jenrick says people should be free to decide for themselves whether they want to work or shop on a Sunday. It is not the most complicated decision they have to make, he says. Burrowes says, if MPs back this plan, they will be backing the idea of extending Sunday working in principle. Burrowes says the impact assessment relating to Sunday trading has been published today. It should have been published earlier, he says. MPs have just started the debate on Sunday trading. David Burrowes, the Conservative MP who is leading the backbench revolt against the government’s plans, opens the debate. He has tabled an amendment taking the plans to liberalise Sunday trading laws out of the enterprise bill. Ministers have produced a compromise proposal on Sunday trading in the hope of averting a defeat when MPs debate the issue later this afternoon. The amendment would involve piloting the plan to allow Sunday trading laws to be relaxed in zones by local agreement. I will be covering the debate in detail. It should start around 2.30pm. David Cameron has insisted he will not resign if Britain votes to leave the European Union in the forthcoming referendum. At PMQs he was asked by Labour’s Richard Burgon whether he would quit in the event of an Out vote, and he replied: “No.” Cameron has called on Jeremy Corbyn to expel a “readmitted” Labour party member who reportedly said the 9/11 suicide bombers “must never be condemned”. Speaking at PMQs he said: I have to say I was completely appalled to see yesterday that the Labour party has readmitted someone to their party who says, and I believe, that the 9/11 suicide bombers, and I quote, ‘must never be condemned’, and belongs to an organisation that says ‘we defend the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq’. Those are appalling views and I hope the leader of the Opposition will throw this person out of the party rather than welcoming him in. Corbyn did not comment on the matter during PMQs but a senior Labour source said the issue will be examined. Cameron has promised to examine claims relating to the poor treatment of refugees in Folkestone as Angus Robertson asked if he was “ashamed” of the allegations. The SNP’s leader in Westminster questioned Cameron at PMQs about instances of people being “locked up without food”, children being “forced to sleep on concrete floors”, patients with diarrhoea being “denied access to showers” and of a woman who was allegedly beaten when they were detained at a facility in Kent. “Is the prime minister ashamed of this?” he asked. Cameron replied: I will look very carefully at the points you make. I would say that our asylum system is fair and Britain down the ages has given people asylum who are fleeing torture and persecution. When it comes to the issue of resettling Syrian refugees, it was instructive at this week’s European Council with the chart showing how many countries have actually resettled Syrian refugees. Britain has done far better than any other country bar Germany. Cameron seemed to be referring to figures for the number of Syrian refugees resettled from refugees camps in countries like Jordan, not the numbers who have arrived in Europe under their own steam. Buckingham Palace has taken the highly unusual step of complaining to press regulator Ipso about a front-page story in the Sun on Wednesday that claimed the Queen had voiced strong Eurosceptic views. The paper said she expressed her views over lunch with Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister. Clegg told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that the story was not true. He said: It is not true. I have certainly, absolutely no recollection of a conversation like that, which I suspect I would have remembered if it had taken place. I just think it’s wrong that people who want to take us out of the European Union to now try and drag the Queen for their own purposes into this European referendum debate. Sir Ed Davey, the former Lib Dem energy secretary, has said the deal to provide a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point would have cost even more if George Osborne had had his way. The Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, is being threatened with being found in contempt of parliament after failing to appear in front of MPs to give evidence about the retailer’s treatment of workers. Lord Janner is alleged to have carried out a “full range” of sexual offences against children, including rape, a public inquiry has heard. Here is more from Sky’s Faisal Islam on Sunday trading. The debate on Sunday trading is due to start at around 2.30pm. According to Sky’s Faisal Islam, the government has just offered a compromise in the hope of averting a defeat. Nick Clegg has denied hearing the Queen complain about the EU as the Sun claims she did at a lunch he attended at Windsor Castle in 2011. There has been speculation that this may have happened at or after a privy council meeting also attended by Michael Gove and Cheryl Gillan. (See 11.04am.) Asked whether Gove had any recollection of discussions taking place at that meeting, a spokeswoman for the then education secretary told the Press Association: “We don’t comment on private conversations with the Queen.” A spokeswoman for Gillan - who was Welsh secretary at the time - said: “Ms Gillan has no comment to make on privy council matters.” This is what political journalists are saying about PMQs on Twitter. They are unimpressed - particularly with Jeremy Corbyn. From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Telegraph’s Asa Bennett From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From Sky’s Adam Boulton From CapX’s Iain Martin From the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff From the Independent’s Nigel Morris From the Times’s Patrick Kidd From STV’s Stephen Daisley From the BBC’s Sam Macrory From the Guardian’s Anushka Asthana From Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh Imran Hussain from the Child Poverty Action Group has questioned David Cameron’s claim about child poverty. He says it last fell as a result of Labour policies. Jolyon Maugham, the tax barrister and pro-Labour blogger, has posted this chart shedding light on David Cameron’s claim that corporation tax receipts have gone up as the rates of corporation tax have come down. Net receipts may have gone up (I don’t have the figures at the moment), but this graph shows that, as a proportion of overall tax receipts, corporation tax receipts have gone down. PMQs - Verdict: Jeremy Corbyn did make some progress today. As he explains in his Independent article, he has been trying to raise the tone of PMQs, and today he scored a modest success; for one reason or another, David Cameron chose to get through his exchanges with Corbyn without resorting to low-grade abuse. But, otherwise, there was nothing of note in that PMQs (or at least in the Cameron/Corbyn bit). As my colleague Nicholas Watt has just pointed out on the Daily Politics, when William Hague as opposition leader he often adopted a scattergun approach to PMQs, jumping from one topic to another question by question, and made it work. Tony Blair would be left scrabbling to find an answer on one topic, only for Hague to come back with a question addressing something completely different. It worked because Hague’s questions were razor-sharp, and often very funny. Corbyn’s questions are perfectly intelligent and reasonable. But he hasn’t worked out a way of “weaponising” them, either by asking questions with a fiendish quality that makes them impossible for the prime minister to answer, or by phrasing them in a way that is particularly punchy and memorable. Of those 100 questions he has asked, how many can you actually remember? Corbyn might argue that he is not interested in “weaponising” questions because that is part of “the political game-playing of the past”, as he puts it in his Independent article. Perhaps it is. Undoubtedly he was won credit for his refusal to resort to insults at PMQs, and generally his approach has reinforced his reputation as a sincere and serious person. But there are many people who think PMQs is still an arena where the leader of the opposition needs to score points, and Corbyn’s performance today will have left them a little disappointed. Labour’s Barry Gardiner says under the housing bill new tenants will be on fixed tenancies. Doesn’t this mean that children could be evicted when sitting exams? Cameron says the government wants to ensure that social housing is there for the people who need it. But current tenants will not be affected, he says. Labour’s Siobhan McDonagh asks about a constituent who will lose money from the introduction of the living wage, because B&amp;Q are cutting allowances. Will the government ensure that no one loses money from this? Cameron says the government wants people to earn more money. And it is cutting people’s taxes too, he says. Labour’s James Dowd asks how the Tory manifesto commitment to outlaw the use of wild animals in circuses in progressing. Cameron says the government did not manage to meet this in the last parliament. The use of wild animals is licensed so strictly that only two circuses use them. But the government hopes to legislate when time allows. Sir Bill Cash, a Conservative, says the three recent white papers on the EU referendum are not accurate and impartial. This is against the ministerial code. Cameron says he believes in the sovereignty of parliament. Parliament called for them to be published. They were produced by civil servants, he says. He says if Cash does not agree with the content, he should challenge the content, not the process. The SNP’S Martyn Day asks for duty on Scotch whisky to be cut. Cameron says the government supports the whisky industry. Andrew Murrison, a Conservative, asks about rural broadband. Cameron says there is more that needs to be done. Ten years ago all MPs were guilty of leading campaigns against mast, he says. But now their constituents want to be connected to the information super-highway. Labour’s Roberta Blackman-Woods mentions mother’s day asks why the government is cutting public services, and child benefit and work-related benefits so as to take money from women. Cameron says he celebrated mother’s day with his mother, but that he has probably said enough about her. He lists various things the government has done for women. The pay gap is at its lowest published level, he says. He says Labour could help by having no more segregated political meetings. Let us stop the process of having people with bigoted views treating women as second-class citizens. Labour’s Khalid Mahmood asks why the number of skilled apprenticeships has fallen. Cameron says the government is building more houses. And the apprenticeship levy will allow more apprenticeships to be funded. James Cartlidge, a Conservative, asks about school funding. Cameron says the government is changing to consultation process to make it fairer. Cameron says the personal independence payment (PIP) will be better than disability living allowance (DLA) because there is a more personalised assessment process. PMQs - Snap verdict: What was the point? Overall, that was dire, in a way that did not do credit to either of those involved. Corbyn was more scattergun than ever; his questions were perfectly sensible, but there was zero follow-through, and - taken as a whole - his script sounded rambling and unfocused. Cameron was a bit better, because he had answers on corporation tax and child poverty, but he did sound as if he was just reciting a dull brief, and he completely ignored the first question about welfare cuts. Cameron’s “100 not out” was the only line that was remotely memorable. Corbyn says there has been a 10% cut in real terms in sixth-form education, and a cut in adult education. Isn’t it true this recovery is build on sand? Cameron says 16 to 18-year-old education has been protected in this spending round. The government can only do this because it has a strong and growing economy. Corbyn’s tax plan are a risk to the economy. And we know from Scotland that Labour would put taxes up for people earning more than £20,000. Corbyn says construction apprenticeships have fallen. Will Corbyn stop those cuts, and invest in the future. Cameron says there has been a massive boost to apprenticeships under this government. And housebuilding has increased. Completions are up. Housing starts are at their highest level since 2007. Corbyn says child poverty is going up. He asks why Osborne warned last week of further cuts, if the economy is so strong. Who will those cuts fall on? Cameron says there are 860,000 fewer workless households. He says the government is making real changes for these families. Corbyn says the problem is the number of household suffering from inwork poverty. The poorest have paid the most for those cuts, and women have paid the most. On his 99 previous attempts to ask a question, he has been dissatisfied by his answers. So can Cameron help Callum. Callum asks if Cameron will acknowledge the importance of further education colleges. Cameron congratulates Corbyn on getting to 100 not out. He says there is now a proper education system that will drive opportunity. There are 800,000 fewer people in relative poverty than in 2010. That is the Labour measures. So will Corbyn admit he was wrong about child poverty. Jeremy Corbyn says Cameron said last week the economy was strong. If it is strong, why is the government pushing through a £30 a week cut for the disabled. Cameron says he is disappointed that Corbyn did not answer the point about the Labour member. The economy is growing, he says. Corbyn says people are not content to see someone with cancer, unable to work, reduced to poverty. In the summer budget Osborne found £6.6bn to reduce corporation tax, even though it is low. The Children’s Society has shown that spending on children is falling. Cameron says corporation tax receipts are up by 20% under this government. If we put up tax rates, we would get less money in. Labour care about making a political point. The Tories care about services. James Berry, a Conservative, asks what progress is being made in tackling the source of the terrorist threat in Syria. Cameron says we are making good progress in pushing Daesh back in Iraq and Syria. He says he was appalled to see Labour has readmitted someone to the Labour party who was defended 9/11. Labour should throw that person out. Labour’s Karin Smith says people in Bristol want to see more apprenticeships. But they wonder how the government will deliver 3m. Does David Cameron have a delivery plan? Yes, says Cameron. There were 2m in the last parliament, and the target is for 3m in this one. PMQs starts soon. Jeremy Corbyn will be asking his 100th question, he writes in an article for the Independent. He says that, while he has tried to change the tone of PMQs, David Cameron has been unwilling to reciprocate. The leadership campaign showed me that for many PMQs are out of touch, too theatrical, and simply not addressing the issues most people care about. So I tried something different – putting to David Cameron some of the thousands of questions sent to me by members of the public. Today will mark my 100th question at PMQs. But while I’ve taken a different approach to asking the questions, David Cameron has carried on failing to give proper answers. David Cameron once said he was “fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster”. But the experience of the last six months suggests he has come to rather enjoy it. When given the chance to defend his government’s record, he has instead preferred to opt for petty attacks, while avoiding the substance of the issue, and ignoring the real problems facing our people. At the launch of his manifesto Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, said Jeremy Corbyn should be doing more to make the case for Britain staying in the EU. According to the Press Association, when asked if Corbyn should be “more proactive” in speaking up for EU membership, he replied: Without a doubt. I think we should be on the pitch campaigning with anybody who wants us to stay in the European Union. Membership of the European Union is bigger than party politics. If your job, your livelihood, your prosperity is dependent on being in the European Union, you don’t want politicians playing tribal games and not sharing a platform. I’ve said all along, I’m happy to share a platform with David Cameron in relation to staying in the European Union I go further, as the mayor of London I’ll be on a plane with George Osborne going to China or India or the Middle East to get jobs and investment for London, and to sell London’s businesses overseas. Khan also criticised his Tory opponent Zac Goldsmith for backing Brexit. You can’t want to be the mayor of London and be anything but campaigning proactively for us to stay in the European Union. Because it is a fact that more than 500,000 jobs in London are directly dependent on membership of the EU, it is a fact that 60% of the world’s leading companies - Sony ARG Insurance (for example) - have their EU headquarters in London, and half of London’s exports go to the European Union. Now if you want to be the mayor of London and you are pro-business, you have got to be arguing for us to be in the European Union. That’s why it beggars belief that a Conservative candidate running to be mayor is less pro-business than I am. The Resolution Foundation has produced this graph showing how the number of workers on zero-hours contracts has soared in recent years. And here is a comment on today’s figures from Laura Gardiner, a policy analyst at the foundation. As a share of the workforce, the number of people on zero hours contracts continues to rise despite the record employment rate and the long-overdue pay recovery last year. It’s increasingly clear that ZHCs are here to stay, whatever the economic weather. While some workers value the flexibility they provide, others struggle to manage their fluctuating pay levels week by week and find it hard to budget and put any money aside as savings. This explains why one in three workers on a ZHC want more hours. While zero hours contracts still make up a comparatively small, albeit growing, part of the labour market, it is still crucial that policy makers consider the effect of unstable employment on both workers and the economy, while ensuring the employment rate continues to reach record highs. In a speech in the European parliament today Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said the EU was being “blackmailed” by Turkey. He told MEPs: The historic error made by Chancellor Merkel last year by saying all can come has led directly to this mess and now we are being blackmailed by Turkey. I wish that David Cameron was as good at negotiations as the Turks are. So we are going to go into political union with a country that has got borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria, a country that is poorer than anybody else in the European Union and give free movement to 75m people. And join up with a government that is increasingly Islamist and authoritarian. Well this referendum in Britain is all about what is the safest option. It is pretty clear to me that a vote to remain is a vote for Turkey, a vote to remain is a vote for massively increased immigration into Britain and a vote to remain is a vote that makes Britain more vulnerable to terrorism. It is safer to vote to leave and take back control of our borders. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, has launched his manifesto (pdf) today. He was introduced by Dame Tessa Jowell, the Labour former culture secretary whom he beat for the Labour mayoral nomination, and in his speech he said one of his priorities as mayor would be gender equality. I’ll be a proud feminist in City Hall. It’s not acceptable that your gender can still determine the amount you earn or how far you can rise. It’s incredible in 2016, in one of the world’s most progressive cities, that someone’s pay, or their ability to progress to the highest level in their chosen profession, should depend on their gender. As the Dad of two teenage daughters that’s just not good enough. I’ll fight to break down the barriers to success for women, ensuring that from childhood, girls are provided with opportunities to learn the skills they need to succeed to the extent of their ability. And I’ll publish City Hall’s first annual gender pay audit, and require that large contractors do the same. Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, says today’s zero-hour contract figures show “the crisis of insecure work under the Tories is getting worse with every passing week”. In a statement he went on: Before the election they promised to act on zero-hours contracts, but these numbers show that was nothing more than words. Spiralling numbers of British workers cannot be certain where their next day’s work is coming from, making it virtually impossible to plan finances and family life. The Sun says that the Queen made her comments about Europe at a lunch at Windsor Castle in 2011 attended by Nick Clegg. The BBC’s Nick Sutton has been scouring the Court Circular, and he can find a reference to just one event at Windsor Castle that year attended by Nick Clegg. It was a meeting of the privy council, also attended by Michael Gove, Cheryl Gillan and Lord McNally. Here is the Resolution Foundation thinktank on the zero-hours contract figures. This is from its director, Torsten Bell. This is from the Financial Times’s employment correspondent, Sarah O’Connor. And this is from the BBC’s Norman Smith. Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, says the latest zero-hours contract figures may just be “the tip of the iceberg”. Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, has written an article for PoliticsHome saying Labour must be more willing to accept the need for cuts. If it doesn’t, it risks “doing the Tories’ job for them”, he says. Here’s an excerpt. The electorate have told us twice that they think we do not care enough about the deficit, so to simply call for more spending and borrowing with no mention of public service reform or any recognition of budget priorities risks doing the Tories’ job for them. Yes, there is a case for targeted borrowing specifically to fund long-term capital infrastructure investment, but to gain permission for this case to be heard by the public, we must also argue for fair savings, efficiency and reform. In short, better spending not just more spending. Here is a pollster’s take on the Sun story. It’s from YouGov’s Joe Twyman. Former ministers Peter Lilley, Liam Fox and David Davis are among 11 Tory MPs who have signed a letter in today’s Times (paywall) claiming that David Cameron made a “big concession to fellow EU leaders in his renegotiation deal that has been overlooked by commentators. The letter explains: We surrendered Britain’s one remaining bargaining lever: our right to give or withhold consent to future EU treaties (and some directives) required to convert the eurozone into a political union. We could have used that leverage to get powers devolved to the UK in return for agreeing to eurozone integration — and to block measures harmful to us. That is no longer possible. The agreement pledges that Britain “shall not impede the implementation of legal acts directly linked to the functioning of the euro area” and “will not create obstacles to, but facilitate, such further deepening [ie, creating a political union]” ... While our partners sensed that Britain might leave the EU and could impede further integration, they respected our interests. But a vote to remain would signal that we lack the will to govern ourselves. Our interests would henceforth be far down their concerns. The other signatories are: Chris Heaton-Harris, Stewart Jackson, David Nuttall, Henry Smith, Bernard Jenkin, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Tim Loughton and Tom Pursglove. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, has put out this statement about the zero-hours contract figures. (See 9.55am.) Zero-hour contracts may be a dream for cost-cutting employers. But they can be a nightmare for workers. Many people on zero-hours contracts are unable to plan for their future and regularly struggle with paying bills and having a decent family life. The so-called ‘flexibility’ these contracts offer is far too one-sided. Staff without guaranteed pay have much less power to stand up for their rights and often feel afraid to turn down shifts in case they fall out of favour with their boss. The European Union is proposing better rights for zero-hours workers – another reason why workers should be worried about the risks of Brexit. The Sun, which is strongly Eurosceptic, wants the Queen to speak out on Europe but Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is still getting criticism from anti-Europeans for the fact that he did express views on this matter in his evidence to the Commons Treasury committee yesterday. This morning Peter Bone, a Conservative MP and a spokesman for Grassroots Out (GO), claimed that Carney’s behaviour was so outrageous that he should consider his position. He told the Today programme. It seemed to me that [Carney’s evidence] was a deliberate attempt to scare people into thinking we should remain in the EU, which of course is actually the only card that the people who want to remain in the EU are playing, because there are no positive reasons for staying in the EU. Governors of the Bank of England should say the facts. Mervyn King, who’s no longer at the Bank of England, speculates that the biggest risk is being connected with the euro. So he takes a completely different view to the current governor. I might be wrong, but it seemed he was somewhat arrogant in the way he put this down. I don’t think he liked the fact that MPs were asking him tough questions. It was not a performance that he should be proud of, and it’s certainly not what we should have seen from the governor of the Bank of England. In a reference to John Longworth, who lost his post as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce after speaking out in favour of Brexit, Bone went on: The last person who made a personal view got fired from his job - I just wonder whether [Carney] should be looking at his position today. Carney, of course, strongly denied saying anything inappropriate or bias when another Tory, Jacob Rees-Mogg, made a similar allegation during the hearing yesterday. Here is the Office for National Statistics report about zero-hours contracts. And here is an excerpt from the summary. The latest estimate of the number of people who are employed on “zero-hours contracts” in their main employment, from the LFS, a survey of individuals in households, is 801,000 for October to December 2015, representing 2.5% of people in employment. It should be noted that responses to the LFS can be affected by respondents recognising the term “zero-hours contract”. This latest figure is higher than that for October to December 2014 (697,000 or 2.3 per cent of people in employment), but it is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term “zero-hours contracts” rather than additional contracts. People on “zero-hours contracts” are more likely to be young, part time, women, or in full-time education when compared with other people in employment. On average, someone on a “zero-hours contract” usually works 26 hours a week. Around 1 in 3 people (37%) on a “zero-hours contract” want more hours, with most wanting them in their current job, as opposed to a different job which offers more hours. In comparison 10% of other people in employment wanted more hours. As well as containing figures for the number of people on a zero-hours contract (ZHC), the report also contains the results of a separate survey showing how many ZHCs there are. This figure is always higher because some workers are on more than one. The latest figure shows that there were 1.7m ZHCs in November 2015. This is fewer than when the last survey was conducted (there were 2.1m in May 2015), but the ONS says the apparent drop may be explained by seasonal factors. Here is the Press Association snap about the zero-hours contract figures. The number of workers on zero-hours contracts has increased by 104,000 to 801,000, said the Office for National Statistics. Robert Hardman, the Daily Mail journalist and author of another biography of the Queen, was on the Today programme earlier rubbishing the Sun splash. He said: [The Sun story] really doesn’t stack up. It is utterly out of character. It does put the Queen in a slightly tricky position because the Palace have put out a denial but, on an issue like this, you don’t want to deny too much because it might sound like you’re supporting the other side. On this she has always been utterly neutral. The idea that she would somehow depart from her very conscientious neutrality in front of a well-known Europhile like Mr Clegg over lunch defies belief. Last year the Queen gave a speech in Germany that could be taken as showing support for the EU. She said division in Europe was dangerous. In our lives, we have seen the worst but also the best of our continent. We have witnessed how quickly things can change for the better. But we know that we must work hard to maintain the benefits of the post-war world. We know that division in Europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the west, as well as in the east, of our continent. That remains a common endeavour. Like the Sun (see 9.28am), Republic, the group campaigning for the abolition of the monarch, is arguing that people have a right to know what the Queen thinks about Brexit. This is from its chief executive, Graham Smith. Whether or not we believe the claims in the Sun newspaper, the voters shouldn’t be left guessing what the Queen believes. The voters have a right to know who their head of state is, they have a right to know the truth behind these reports, not be fobbed off by press office denials. Most importantly the voters have the right to decide who they want representing them and the opportunity to replace our head of state if they wish. The Tom Hamilton critique of the Sun’s story (see 9.21am) refers to the Sun admitting that it does not really know what the Queen thinks about Brexit. That is a reference to Tom Newton Dunn’s opinion piece inside the paper, arguing that the Queen is under an obligation to let her subjects know what she thinks. Here is an excerpt. The Queen is very arguably the most respected stateswoman in the world. If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is? Hate it as she might, Her Majesty now has form for political interference. It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. Can it be right that the Queen’s politics should only be known when she and the Prime Minister deem it so between them? Andrew Marr, the BBC broadcaster who wrote a biography of the Queen, thinks the Sun’s headline might be true. But he has also retweeted this very succinct critique of the story. The Sun likes stirring things up, and it has certainly managed to do that this morning. Here’s its splash. And here’s the story. Astute readers will note that the story does not actually justify the headline, although, to be fair, Tom Newton Dunn, the journalist who wrote this story, can spot this too. His intro does not say that the Queen is backing Brexit, just that she has been “hailed as a backer of Brexit” by Tory MPs told about the two anecdotes at the heart of the story. The first is about what the Queen reportedly told Nick Clegg at a lunch in 2011. Her Majesty let rip at the then Deputy PM during a lunch at Windsor Castle, The Sun has been told. The 89-year-old monarch firmly told passionate pro-European Mr Clegg that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction. Her stinging reprimand went on for “quite a while”, leaving other guests around the table stunned. The Sun also backs this up with a second anecdote about what the Queen said at a reception “a few years ago”. One of a group of Parliamentarians in a circle with her at the time asked Her Majesty for her thoughts on Brussels. The Queen is said to have snapped back angrily: “I don’t understand Europe”. A parliamentary source, who relayed the remark to The Sun, said: “It was said with quite some venom and emotion. I shall never forget it”. As the Guardian reports in our version, Clegg has denied the story. And this morning Sir Ed Davey, the former Lib Dem energy secretary, has claimed that the Queen probably wants Britain to stay in the EU - so that Scotland does not vote for independence. He told the Today programme. The Queen knows that if we vote to pull out of the EU, it’s the surest way to destroy the United Kingdom, because Scotland will then vote to go independent, as we all know. So I very much doubt she holds the views that are given her in the Sun. I know Her Majesty believes in the United Kingdom, believes in Great Britain. And if we pull out of the EU, we will destroy our country because Scotland will go independent, the peace process in Northern Ireland will be under real pressure and we won’t have something called the United Kingdom or Great Britain any more. I doubt the Queen wants that. I’ll cover a bit more of this nonsense as the morning goes on. As for the rest of the day, here is the agenda. 9am: A conference opens on social mobility in schools, with speeches from Nick Gibb, the schools minister, and Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Ofsted chief inspector. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on zero-hours contracts. 10.30am: The child abuse inquiry holds a preliminary hearing into allegations involving the late Lord Janner. 12pm: David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 12.40pm: MPs begin debating the enterprise bill. The vote on Sunday trading is expected at around 3.45pm. 2.30pm: Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil sevice, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about extending right to buy to housing association tenants. 3.15pm: David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, gives evidence to the human rights committee. Later I will be focusing on PMQs and the Sunday trading revolt. But I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. If you think there are any voices that I’m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I’m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include “Andrew” in the post). I can’t promise to include everything, but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2013/dec/22/observer-science-quiz-2013-part-2","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-22T00:02:00Z","webTitle":"The Observer science quiz 2013: part 2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/22/observer-science-quiz-2013-part-2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/dec/22/observer-science-quiz-2013-part-2","fields":{"headline":"The Observer science quiz 2013: part 2","bodyText":"IN THE NEWS 21.

The surprisingly intimate video chat really highlighted our readers' depth of expertise in specialist areas. In this case, everything from marine protected areas, energy efficiency, \"re-wilding\" and restoring habitats, and biodiversity offsets to planning reforms and sustainable housing, nuclear power from an engineer's point of view, and farming subsidies. You can watch some of the highlights of the video here (and the full version here), but below are some of the other highlights. In answer to reader Nicholas Jackson, George made clear he stood by his backing for nuclear power, which he declared so strongly after the Fukushima disaster: Yes, I do [still back nuclear power]. I feel that when we are faced with what could be an existential issue in the form of climate change, the idea of closing down our primary source of low carbon energy which will almost inevitably be replaced with high carbon energy in the form of gas or coal... the idea making our priority the closing down of that rather than the closing down of fossil fuels looks to me like utter madness. Darryl Croft asked if we needed to make energy efficiency mandatory: It is plain to me we need a mandatory [energy saving] target. It is not going to happen under current circumstances and unless the government gets a kick up the backside it's not going to happen at all. The [EU energy efficiency] directive foresees Europe saving over 300m tonnes of carbon through energy efficiency but it's simply not going to happen unless governments are constrained to put that directive into force. Nicola Toki in New Zealand asked if her country's green 'brand' was at threat from more coal and cows: Well, it's not going to do much good. I'm sure you're right, people see New Zealand as a pristine place to travel to, not that I would encourage people to fly. You're right, A great deal of the attraction of NZ is it has these stunning habitats. There's quite a lot of academic work showing very often these extractive industries destroy more economic activity than they create. Speaking from the Cyclade islands in Greece, Constantine Alexander asked about George's views on the best ways to protect marine life: Just a few pocket hankerchiefs of sea are protected from that [destructive fishing]... which together amount for just 5 square km, a tiny area of our seas. That's bad not just for the environment, it's bad for fishermen, because there's nowhere for the fish to breed and to be protected in order to build up their stocks. While I understand what you're saying about the need for conservation groups about proposals for how marine fisheries are managed... I also think the core of any conservation policy for fihsiers has to be strict marine reserves in which no commercial exploitation takes place. I wanted to thank everyone who took part in the Hangout, and who took the time to watch. We're still very much in the learning phase about the best ways to use Hangouts, and experimenting. I'm keen to hear your views on how we can best use the technology - more discussions like this, or as a way to give access to people in areas you wouldn't be able to visit, such as the Rio+20 earth summit in June.

The move would in effect remove the most important prop from the beleaguered renewable energy sector – the Europe-wide targets stipulating that a proportion of each member state's energy must come from renewable sources. That target should be scrapped when its current phase – requiring member states to generate 20% of energy from renewables – runs out in 2020, according to a secret submission to the European commission. \"The UK envisages multiple low-carbon technologies: renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage, all competing freely against each other in the years to come … For this reason, we cannot support a 2030 renewables target,\" it reads. But the document calls for \"some type of target for 2030\", which a government adviser told the Guardian is likely to be a target for low-carbon energy. This would include nuclear alongside renewables and so far unproven technology for capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground. The issue of giving nuclear parity with renewables is likely to be controversial for the energy secretary, Ed Davey, as the Liberal Democrat party's official position is \"no to nuclear\". Industry experts and green groups said that nuclear power and the fledgling renewables industry would not compete on a level playing field, because nuclear technology has benefited from more than six decades of public subsidy, while renewable power has had its support slashed. The UK's renewable energy sector has already suffered a series of blows, with an anti-renewables backlash whipped up by right-leaning thinktanks and Tory MPs, more than 100 of whom sent a letter to the prime minister attacking renewables and calling on him to cut subsidies from onshore wind farms. Many wind turbine manufacturers have expressed concern over the effect of this on their prospective multibillion-pound investments in the UK. Meanwhile, the gas industry has been lobbying heavily, arguing that gas offers a cheap alternative to renewables, despite being a fossil fuel. Removing the targets could spell disaster in particular for new forms of renewables such as wave and tidal power, which had been tipped as areas in which the UK could lead the world. Ruth Davis, of Greenpeace, warned that the government's stance would threaten jobs. \"Many companies have already put their investments in UK renewables projects on hold, as they lose confidence in the government's domestic energy policies,\" she said. \"By opposing a European renewables target, the UK is signalling that it would prefer business as usual in its own energy sector to a German-style green industrial revolution.\" Davis added that the moves to boost nuclear power would backfire, and be a gift to the gas industry. \"Including carbon capture and storage and nuclear power in the target would enable the big six energy companies to retain their current stranglehold on our power sector, building whatever kind of power generation most suits their business models. It will lock in public subsidies to nuclear generation and make us more dependent on expensive imported gas.\" Many of the potential jobs in nuclear generation in the UK, spearheaded by the French company EDF, are likely to go to French experts, as their nuclear industry is much bigger. Claude Turmes, the Green MEP who was the European parliament draftsman for the original renewable energy directive, warned that the UK government's stance would imperil efforts to tackle climate change. He said: \"Low carbon targets are a Trojan horse, pushed by the nuclear industry and its proxies, to give a boost to ailing nuclear power. Nuclear is already more expensive than a number of renewable energy sources and by 2020 will be more expensive than offshore wind power, for which there is a huge potential in the UK. \"It is hard to understand why the UK government wants to waste its energy on this expensive French technology, when it could be focusing on maximising the potential of home-grown renewable energy technologies, which would create thousands of jobs in the UK.\" Davey said the UK was at the forefront of climate policy in Europe, arguing for the EU's target of cutting emissions by 20% by 2020 to be toughened to 30%. He said: \"I am strongly committed to making the case in Europe for a 30% emissions reduction target. Stepping up our ambition on emissions reduction makes sense for energy policy, it makes sense in terms of green growth and jobs, and now we know it makes sense financially, because it would put us on the most cost-effective pathway to our 2050 target.\" • This article was amended on 12 March. The original headline suggested the 2030 target was to be scrapped; there is currently no 2030 target. The standfirst also incorrectly said the document talked of rebranding nuclear power as a renewable form of energy; this has has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/04/energy-chief-nuclear-safety-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-04T10:25:07Z","webTitle":"EU energy chief 'satisfied' with nuclear safety despite critical report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/energy-chief-nuclear-safety-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/04/energy-chief-nuclear-safety-report","fields":{"headline":"EU energy chief 'satisfied' with nuclear safety despite critical report","bodyText":"The European Union's energy chief has called the bloc's nuclear power stations \"satisfactory\" despite a report on Thursday that showed hundreds of defects, with dozens of reactors failing to meet international safety standards. The report – the \"stress test\" of Europe's 145 nuclear reactors – was commissioned after the Fukushima incident in Japan last year. It found that bringing Europe's nuclear power stations up to international standards could cost €25bn. Some MEPs criticised the commission for not urging stronger action on the nuclear industry. Almost all of the EU's nuclear plants need some form of upgrade or repair, ranging from minor updates to substantial overhauls, but none requiring closure, according to the tests. One issue found in some plants was insufficient preparation for what could happen if the cooling systems were compromised, as happened in Fukushima. This is potentially serious as it could lead to meltdown. Some of the plants do not have sufficient safety measures in place to cope securely with a serious natural disaster, the tests found. But some other changes needed can be carried out relatively easily. Guenther Oettinger, the energy commissioner, said: \"Our stress test was strict, serious and transparent. It reveals bluntly and objectively what we are good at and where there is a need to improve. Generally the situation is satisfactory but there is no room for complacency. We must work together to ensure that the highest safety standards are in force in every single nuclear power plant in Europe, for the safety of our citizens.\" Some of the defects involve basic safety and monitoring measures, such as the lack of seismic monitors at reactor sites in several countries including France and the Czech Republic. Oettinger said the stress test was an opportunity to ensure the comprehensive enforcement of international safety standards across member states. He said: \"Now we know whether the highest international standards are used for very essential safety features, for example how the risk of an earthquake is measured.\" The stress tests, which included international experts carrying out spot tests of plants, took place in co-operation with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group, made of member states' national safety authorities. Oettinger said: \"We have assessed the safety and robustness of nuclear power plants in case of extreme natural events. This means especially flood and earthquakes. Both scenarios were assessed simultaneously. We have covered air plane crashes to the extent that they have the same effect as tsunami and earthquakes, meaning that they shut down normal safety and cooling functions. \" But campaigners and MEPs said the nuclear industry had been let off too lightly and demanded to know how the commission would enforce standards. Marita Ulvskog, vice president of the Socialists and Democrats grouping in the European Parliament, said: \"There are several nuclear facilities that would not withstand extreme events like an earthquake or a terrorist attack. We must guarantee that all measures are taken to protect human lives and the environment. A nuclear disaster [in one member state] would have catastrophic consequences for neighbouring countries and we need to find a common solution.\" Rebecca Harms, co-president of the Green grouping in the parliament, said that the stress test had \"been orchestrated to cause as little stress to the nuclear industry as possible\". She said: \"There are no real proposals for follow-up. However, the fact that the stress tests failed to address risks in crucial areas – ageing technology, terrorist attacks or human error – is a more damning indictment of the whole exercise.\" She insisted that the stress test should not be used as an excuse to prolong the life of elderly reactors: \"At the very least, the commission should be pressing for the security deficiencies identified in the report to be rectified. However, given the prohibitive costs – with estimates of up to €25bn – investors will only be willing to commit to this if the reactors stay online far longer than foreseen for safety reasons. These stress tests cannot be used as an excuse to justify lifetime extensions for decrepit nuclear reactors. If this exercise was serious, the commission should be recommending the closure of unsafe or ageing reactors.\" One nuclear insider, however, said that even under the stress of such a severe natural disaster as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the threat to the nuclear power stations in Fukushima and elsewhere in Japan had been contained. Greenpeace spokesman Mark Breddy said: \"It's not surprising that the tests, though limited, have uncovered major concerns. Nuclear power is inherently risky, and failures, accidents and close calls happen all the time. But there are serious safety issues that the stress tests haven't looked into. EU governments must act fast by shutting down the oldest and most risky plants and by ordering more thorough testing on the remaining plants.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/oct/03/british-nuclear-china-investors-pull-out","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-03T17:50:02Z","webTitle":"British nuclear plans suffer blow as Chinese investors pull out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/03/british-nuclear-china-investors-pull-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/oct/03/british-nuclear-china-investors-pull-out","fields":{"headline":"British nuclear plans suffer blow as Chinese investors pull out","bodyText":"The government's nuclear energy plans were in trouble as Chinese investors withdrew interest in two projects and local councils postponed a decision on storing atomic waste. Areva, the French nuclear engineering group, confirmed that it had pulled out of the running to buy a stake in Horizon Nuclear Power, the enterprise planning to construct new reactors at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Areva said its partner, the state-owned China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group (CGNPC), had also shelved its bid. \"Areva and CGNPC have suspended their interest in the planned sale of Horizon Nuclear Power and did not submit a bid,\" an Areva spokeswoman said, adding that the company was still committed to new nuclear in the UK through other avenues. This is a blow for the government because Areva is at an advanced stage in getting regulatory approval for the design of its European pressurised reactor (EPR), while the Chinese are considered to have the deepest pockets. Two other bidders, one involving US-based engineering group Westinghouse and the other led by Hitachi of Japan, are still in the running to take a stake in Horizon – although Westinghouse's backer, another Chinese state-owned firm, China National Nuclear Power Corporation, is also understood to have withdrawn from the consortium. \"The Chinese could not get the commitments they were looking for from the British government,\" said one source with contacts in the Beijing nuclear industry, adding that the problem was about technology rather than political issues. Some British MPs and commentators had raised questions about the wisdom of allowing Chinese state firms access to sensitive UK energy systems. There have also been reports that Iberdrola, the Spanish group that owns Scottish Power, is considering dropping out of a separate consortium bid to build a new nuclear plant near Sellafield in Cumbria, while France's EDF was said to be struggling to complete work on a generic design assessment it needs in order to proceed with building a new atomic power station in collaboration with Areva at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Office of Nuclear Regulation has been concentrating on a generic design assessment of EDF and Areva's EPR facility but industry specialists said the process was unlikely to be completed by the end of November as planned in order for a final investment decision on Hinkley to be made by the end of the year. EDF insisted everything was \"on track\". The UK government was shaken in March this year when German utilities, E.ON and RWE, said they wanted to pull out of Horizon Nuclear Power, with a deadline for bids last Friday. Neither E.ON nor RWE were willing to comment on the situation but the withdrawal of a leading name such as Areva plus the possible exit of the two huge Chinese groups will worry a government in desperate need of new atomic plants to meet a looming power shortage when old nuclear and coal-fired stations are retired. Any total withdrawal of the Chinese from Horizon will put more pressure on Westinghouse, now owned by Toshiba, and Hitachi, whose nuclear technology is not yet near any licensing approval for use in the UK. The other project eyeing new nuclear in the UK is NuGen, owned by Spain's Iberdrola and France's GDF Suez, which is considering reactors in Cumbria and says it will make a decision by 2015. British utility SSE has already withdrawn while Iberdrola has been unable to quash speculation that it is consiering a similar move in reaction to heavy financial commitments elsewhere in the UK. Meanwhile, the government's hopes of proceeding with much delayed plans for a high-level waste repository in the one area of Britain that has shown any appetite for such a scheme were also set back. Three councils, Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland districts, this week delayed a decision on new nuclear waste sites – due in October – until January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-10T18:48:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband condemns 'rip-off' energy firms after SSE 8% price rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband condemns 'rip-off' energy firms after SSE 8% price rise","bodyText":"The row over soaring fuel bills escalated on Thursday when Ed Miliband accused SSE, one of the country's big six energy providers, of \"ripping off\" 7 million customers with an 8.2% price increase. SSE, which earlier this week promised above-inflation dividend payouts to its shareholders, admitted that raising gas and electricity hikes over £100 to an average of £1,465 per annum would lead to more fuel poverty. But it blamed government policies for the price rise, which will take effect on 15 November. Amid expectations that other big energy firms are poised to follow suit, Miliband attacked David Cameron for letting power companies \"get away with it\" and letting down the British people. \"The companies are putting up prices because we've got a broken energy market and they are ripping off consumers,\" he said. \"This latest scandal shows why the government needs to act. The companies are trying to blame everyone else, the government is trying to blame everyone else … They're responsible, they're not getting a grip. We would get a grip: we'd freeze prices, we'd reform a broken energy market.\" Cameron responded by saying the proposal to freeze energy prices, first unveiled by Miliband at the Labour conference two weeks ago, was a \"con\" because the increases were driven by international pressures and a moratorium would not help. The prime minister said the best way of reducing energy bills was to tackle the roots causes of high wholesale gas prices, including improving competition between energy companies and pushing ahead with shale fracking. Cameron said green levies to subsidise renewables would not be on bills \"for a moment longer than is necessary\" but added that the UK needs to have a \"balanced energy mix\" including nuclear power and wind power. To achieve this, \"some of those subsidies have been necessary\", he said. Consumer groups warned that other big six companies would be poised to push through their own increases shortly, while the energy regulator, Ofgem, promised to start a consultation on how to improve the transparency of company profits. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer campaign group Which?, described the move as a \"massive blow\" to SSE customers at a time when rising energy prices are consistently one of the top worries for hard-pressed consumers. He called on the government to intervene in the energy market to \"make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check\", such as breaking up the biggest energy companies into separate power generation and supply businesses. Mark Todd, a director at the price comparison service energyhelpline, said: \"The dam has burst: expect a flood of price rises to follow. Other major suppliers are very likely to follow suit in a matter of days. It will be a bitter pill to swallow for customers, who have been hit by 40% price rises now in the last four years.\" SSE, which was fined a record £10.5m by Ofgem earlier this year for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling, insisted that a 13% rise in government levies plus the costs of upgrading electricity and gas networks, along with a rise in wholesale prices, were responsible for pushing up its bills. Will Morris, managing director of SSE's retail business, said that \"if politicians want to do something to make bills cheaper and fairer, they should take the cost of government policies out of bills and fund them through general taxation instead\". The company has promised not to increase its bills again until 2014 but while saying \"sorry\" to customers, its website still talks of \"our dividend obsession\", and adds: \"we have just one strategic priority: sustained real dividend growth.\" Earlier this week its finance director, Gregor Alexander, insisted the company would stick to above-inflation dividend rises, while in a question and answer section on its website SSE admits \"in all likelihood and unfortunately\" the latest tariff increases will result in more fuel poverty. This brought a stinging attack from the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action. \"We don't believe that SSE is apologetic about the price rises; they reported £1.4bn pre-tax profits this spring, and five of their top executives are earning over £1m a year. The big six continue to put their own profits before the lives of millions of people in the UK currently making the impossible choice between heating and eating,\" said the organisation's Clare Welton. Meanwhile, the National Debtline service said it had received a record 15,502 calls from people seeking help with energy debts in the first six months of this year, up 10% on the same period of 2012. Britain has been affected by a series of changes that have driven up prices, including the running-down of North Sea gas supplies, rising international demand for gas following the Fukushima shutdowns, and a government drive to reduce carbon emissions by subsidising the building of wind farms and solar arrays. But the six dominant energy companies have made themselves deeply unpopular with numerous scandals involving mis-selling, high executive bonuses and low corporation tax payments. Critics believe they hold a gun to the head of government by warning the lights will go out unless they make substantial profits; but they repeatedly argue that their retail margins are relatively low, at around 5%. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, appealed to other firms to refrain from raising their prices to avoid pushing more people into poverty. \"This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets. The hike comes at a time when some working households are turning to food banks to feed their families as they struggle to cope with the rising cost of living. I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/02/the-beauty-of-wind-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-02T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: The beauty of windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/the-beauty-of-wind-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/02/the-beauty-of-wind-farms","fields":{"headline":"The beauty of windfarms","bodyText":"Research says renewable energy will overtake nuclear power by 2018 (Windfarm sector grows despite Tory opposition, 30 October), but the government seems about to announce a set of subsidy levels and deployment targets that are radically biased against onshore wind and in favour of nuclear power. Various sources have suggest the government is likely to set the \"strike price\" to be paid for nuclear power at around £100 per MWh of electricity generated. Yet, onshore wind is likely to get no more than £80 per MWh under the government's electricity market reform. There is also talk that a cap will be announced on windfarm deployment to satisfy anti-windfarm Tories. This smacks of giant political bias in favour of nuclear rather than wind power. If onshore wind was paid £100 per MWh we could have a lot more onshore windfarms – but the government clearly prefers to have nuclear if it can. How can they justify such a policy? This is contrary to public opinion, which gives more support to wind power than nuclear. We hear claims that Hitachi's nuclear reactors will be \"reliable\" – even though half of the advanced boiling water reactors (promoted by Hitachi) being operated work for less than half the time. At least you can predict windspeeds in advance with some accuracy, which is more than you can say for nuclear power stations which suddenly go offline without warning. Dr David Toke Senior lecturer in energy policy, University of Birmingham • Once again Simon Jenkins (In the wind turbine debate, who dares utter the B-word?, 2 November) expounds his condescending view that we should all agree that wind turbines are inherently ugly and blots on the landscape. The only reason he can see the view from Mam Tor, or anywhere else for that matter, is because our ancestors cut down all those beautiful trees to make charcoal, build mills, houses and ships. Also visible in the Peak District and Cornwall are the remains of lead and tin mines now deemed worthy of preservation and restoration as part of our industrial heritage. In their heyday I'm sure Simon would have objected to their ruin of the landscape had he been able to write rather than having to fill a tub with ore to earn his crust. Many people find the sight of wind turbines beautiful and a heartwarming indication that at least we are trying. I would love to see a wind farm from my kitchen window on the edge of the Dales National Park. In view of the latest long-term pollution figures from Fukushima, turbines are distinctly more attractive than further nuclear development. Duncan Grimmond Harrogate • On-shore wind farms change the character of the countryside. They transform the soul-nurturing nature of the rural landscape into a restless semi-industrial scene with the introduction of artefacts which speak of our stressful hi-tech world. This is a very serious loss for the indigenous population and moreover, in the long term, tourists will realise that much of what they came for has gone. The correct place for wind farms is off shore where the wind is. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • Despite what Simon Jenkins may think, it is simply not the case that the planning system does not try to deal with aesthetics. In Cornwall, at least, the council's landscape officers are consultees for every wind turbine application. They may not use the B word, but they have no hesitation in using phrases such as \"the proposal will adversely impact the existing landscape character of the locality\". The same landscape officers will extol the merits of the redundant 19th-century industry that litters the countryside using adjectives such as iconic. The problem with beauty is that it is in the eye of the beholder. To me, wind turbines are structures of beauty and my view is shared by many; to Jenkins, wind turbines are ugly and his view is shared by many. For a large proportion of the population, however, wind turbines are greeted with the same indifference they display towards pylons: they accept that, if we want to benefit from modern technology, we will inevitably see some manifestation of the industry that supplies it.

People can then go away and come to their own conclusions,\" said Heiko Hansen, who with his partner, Helen Evans, has recreated the sounds, tremors and flames you would get from a fracking operation. The process of fracking – or hydraulic fracturing – involves drilling a hole deep into the dense shale rocks that contain natural gas, then pumping in vast quantities of water mixed with sand and chemicals at very high pressure. This opens up tiny fissures in the rock, through which the trapped gas can then escape. Many shale deposits are buried under aquifers, and if the cement casing around the wellhole is not adequate, then the process of drilling and fracking can release the chemicals into the aquifer. Leaks of methane can occur, leading potentially to fires or explosions. Supporters of fracking say it is the only way of developing domestic gas supplies. At the gallery space at Liverpool's Fact (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology), there is a scale model of the mobile platform that would be used to drill down, and there is a pool of waste water nearby. The experience is eerie and almost otherworldly, and will, they hope, provoke debate. \"We decided to do fracking because it is a pressing issue,\" said Hansen. It is particularly relevant in the north-west, where there are large reserves. Centrica has announced £160m investment in fracking fields around Blackpool. \"Everybody talks about fracking,\" Hansen said, but the iconographic image of it has not yet been found.\" Hansen and Evans – who together are known as HeHe – say the installation is realistic. \"Some people today have asked if we're drilling or not. I'll leave it up to people's interpretation,\" says Hansen. \"You're always forbidden from going to see these things. There are always fences and barriers; you can't touch; you can't come close. It is like nuclear power stations and oil drilling rigs: these are the most sophisticated things ever built but we can't touch them or personally appropriate them. So there is a role for the arts to say: let's do it as a performance to bring people closer.\" The Fact director, Mike Stubbs, said: \"What struck is a how beautiful it is and how musical it is. It felt more like a fairground ride.\" Fact is celebrating 10 years as a pioneering centre for new-media art, and the fracking installation is part of a project called Turning Fact Inside Out. Elsewhere in the building, the Polish artist Katarzyna Krakowiak has turned the building into a giant listening device, gathering previously hidden sounds that she has put into an enormous chute. The American artist Steve Lambert is showing a piece called Capitalism Works for Me! True/False in the UK for the first time. It is like a huge carnival sign, and people will be able to vote either way. Last Thursday, capitalism was losing 15 to 6. Visitors will be able to pedal an installation and watch a screen that will give the impression of cycling around north Liverpool – and then Rotterdam and Madrid. • Turning Fact Inside Out runs until 25 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
