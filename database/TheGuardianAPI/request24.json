The advantages of having wheels on your Mars lander are obvious – having safely delivered your scientifically priceless instruments over interplanetary distances, the last thing you need is for a particularly fascinating rock to be tantalisingly out of reach. When you're able to move your instruments to your target, it's so much easier to answer the mysteries of the universe, or at least a tiny part of it. The three Apollo astronaut crews who travelled to the moon with their own rovers in 1971-72 just had to hop in and drive off to explore sites well away from their landing sites. For unmanned rovers, however, adding wheels introduces more complexity and expense. Although the obvious way to drive a rover that's far away is through direct remote control, radio commands sent at the speed of light still take a long time to travel the huge distances between driver and wheels. This was a problem for the first unmanned planetary rovers: the Soviet Union's two Lunokhods, which landed on the moon in 1970 and 1973. Despite commands taking only 1.3s to reach the rovers, the team of five controlling them suffered from the stress of always trying to second-guess where the rover would be a few seconds hence. One small steering mistake on a slope could have left the rovers stranded like upturned beetles on the lunar surface. Despite the strains involved in driving them, both missions were hugely successful, with the wheeled robots operating for several months and covering tens of kilometres. You can see tracks here and here. Such remote control is largely impractical on Mars: radio signals currently take almost 14 minutes to reach it, so if Curiosity, known also as Mars Science Laboratory, was being sent individual commands to make each movement, it'd take almost 30 minutes to check whether it had responded correctly. Mission operators either have to live with the painfully slow progress associated with operating a craft very gingerly so far away, or develop sophisticated fail-safe onboard systems to control rovers' movements and avoid any hazards. The first mini-rover was delivered to Mars on the Soviet Mars 3 lander in 1971 but perished within minutes, having landed in a dust storm. Twenty-six years later, Nasa's Mars Pathfinder was delivered to the surface following a very bouncy, airbag-cushioned landing. Its Sojourner rover, which was the size of a microwave oven, trundled around a few metres from its landing pad carrying cameras and an X-ray spectrometer to test the make-up of rocks. It was issued regular commands to drive to new targets which it followed while continually testing for hazards using lasers, imaging and tilt sensors. Sojourner's baby steps continued for almost three months until the lander through which it was communicating with Earth fell silent. In 2003/04, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on opposite sides of the planet to begin its most extensive surface exploration yet. Controlling these more sophisticated vehicles sometimes proved fiddly, especially early on. \"Though the hardware and software had been thoroughly tested, you never know exactly how they're going to perform until you start driving them,\" recalls former operations team member Dr Craig Leff, now working on the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. \"They will all have little variances and you need to learn the idiosyncrasies of any particular vehicle.\" The rovers were equipped with autonomous navigation: when told their next target, they planned their own route to that spot and avoided hazards on their own. The hazard-avoidance systems were very sensitive early on in the mission, but operators became more comfortable with pushing the rovers' abilities, and sometimes drove the rovers blind to maximise their speed. However, Opportunity spent almost 40 days immobile after an innocent-looking dune turned out to be a sand trap. Although meant to operate for only three months each, Spirit didn't fall silent until 2010, after two of its wheels stopped turning. It eventually succumbed to the harsh Martian winter. Opportunity is still going strong, and has driven 34km in the 3,000 Martian days since landing. It recently snapped this view eastwards across the Endeavour crater on Mars. The Mars Science Laboratory team obviously hope to clock as much mileage from the latest rover, but once the dust has settled today at Gale Crater, they plan to go easy on Curiosity: it may be a week before it leaves its landing spot. Once it gets going, progress is expected to be quicker than for Spirit and Opportunity. Nuclear power means there's no need to wait for sunlight to turn Curiosity's wheels, which are bigger to carry it largely unhindered across the rocky surface, and it won't be affected by dim lighting conditions during dust storms. It should cover at least 19km during its two-year mission. Scientists are eager for Curiosity to get rolling, but with no insurance or breakdown cover, it won't put its foot to the floor. Its maximum speed will be ninety metres per hour - about twice that of a giant tortoise.

Such measures are largely predicated on a \"rational actor model\" in which the west hopes Iran's leaders will eventually find it in their own interests to give up their nuclear programme. The problem with such a strategy is not that Iran's leaders are irrational but that such a game only works if the west knows how Iran evaluates costs and benefits and the options Iran believes it has available. After the failure of previous sanctions, the west has imposed a new set of much tougher sanctions while Iran has adopted a more assertive stance vis-a-vis the west, stating that it will respond to economic and military threats with its \"own threats\". Why, then, has Iran failed to respond to international pressure? According to the basic sanctions model, the target of sanctions will alter its behaviour in the desired direction when the costs of defiance become greater than its perceived costs of compliance. Yet despite Iran's reliance on oil, the structural weakness of its economy, and deep economic costs such as the sharp rise in inflation, negative economic growth and increasing unemployment, it has failed to bend. This should prompt policymakers to ask how Iran evaluates the costs of sanctions and defying the west. First, for Iran's leaders, ideological and security concerns trump economic ones: the security of the ruling class and being seen as protecting the Islamic Republic's founding myths. The regime has emphasised three central myths since its creation in 1979 – \"Islamic justice\", \"divine rule\" and the \"struggle against imperialism\" – all of which are essential for maintaining its power and legitimacy. Hence, in the eyes of the Iranian leadership, any damage to these myths is of far more importance than, for example, losing even billions of dollars. Second, the west and Iran do not share an understanding of what the goals of the sanctions actually are. The goal of the west is to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power but that would only succeed if its existing leaders switched policies or were replaced by new, more accommodating, leaders as a result of internal pressure. In the latter case, the economic sanctions would supposedly increase discontent among the middle class and so revive protest activity. For its part, Iran believes that the goal of sanctions is to prevent the spread of the Iranian model in the region and to demonstrate to the world that the Islamic Republic is a failed model not to be emulated by Arab revolutionaries. Thus, according to the strategic thinking of the west, Iran is being pushed into a corner where it must choose between preservation of the regime and the continuation of its nuclear programme together with its regional ambitions. Rationally, Iran will choose the preservation of the regime. In the eyes of supreme leader Ali Khamenei, however, continuation of its nuclear programme and pursuance of its regional ambitions constitute that preservation of the regime. He believes that promotion of the Iranian model in the Middle East is the key to the regime's long-term security and so external pressure from sanctions is tolerable in the short term. Given this view, Tehran believes it must wait patiently for an inter-related set of changes that ultimately favour it. Iran sees an economic crisis that increasingly cripples the west. Also, Iran may believe itself to be close enough to join the nuclear club already – that it will soon reach the point where circumstances radically shift in its favour. Sanctions also play into Khamenei's efforts to consolidate his power and justify internal suppression. Hence, Iran may actually view sanctions not as a cost, but as a benefit. Iran can – and does – point to sanctions as the suffering it bears in its role as the standard bearer of resistance in the Islamic world against what it regards as US imperialism. On this view, the Islamic Republic is a model to be emulated by Arab revolutionaries, the successful export of which only further legitimises the three founding myths of the regime. Sanctions are therefore an economic investment with short-term costs that will pay large dividends in the long term. Iran is not playing chess, no matter how much the US and the EU might wish it to be so. With Iran and the west playing different games, a peaceful resolution in the near future seems very unlikely. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2012/may/23/tensions-iran-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-23T17:00:45Z","webTitle":"Six-nation group tries to defuse tensions over Iran nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/23/tensions-iran-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/23/tensions-iran-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"Six-nation group tries to defuse tensions over Iran nuclear programme","bodyText":"World powers presented Iran with a package of proposals at talks in Baghdad on Wednesday, aimed at defusing tensions over its nuclear programme and fending off the threat of a new Middle East war. The package was presented by a six-nation group of negotiators, from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, and called on Iran to stop the production of 20%-enriched uranium and halt enrichment at an underground site at Fordow. In return, Iran would receive reactor fuel for making medical isotopes at a research reactor in Tehran, safety guidance and equipment for the Tehran reactor and a nuclear power station at Bushehr, and access to spare parts for its civil airliners, the safety of which has been put in jeopardy as a result of sanctions. Iranian media reported that the chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, had put forward a counter-proposal but gave no details. Sources at the talks said that Jalili had talked generally about Iran's rights and responsibilities under the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but did not go into specifics in an initial three-hour session of talks before a late lunch break. The discussions resumed on Wednesday evening, and Iranian media were predicting they would continue on Thursday, although there was no confirmation of that from western diplomats in Baghdad. A western diplomat said: \"We had a detailed exchange this morning. The E3+3 [a collective name used by the six-nation negotiating group] presented our package. The atmosphere was businesslike and meetings will continue this afternoon.\" The talks are taking place at Iraqi government offices in the highly fortified \"green zone\" in Baghdad, amid high security across the city. The aim of the six-nation group, chaired by the EU high representative for foreign policy, Catherine Ashton, is to begin detailed negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme that will yield sufficient results to dissuade Israel from launching military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. Stopping the production of 20% uranium and stopping enrichment at Fordow are seen as priorities by the six-nation group for forestalling military action. The 20%-enriched uranium is significantly purer that the fuel used in Iran's power station at Bushehr and would be relatively easy to turn into weapons-grade (90% plus) uranium, should Iran decide to build a warhead. If such a decision was made and Iran opted to withdraw from the NPT, the underground site at Fordow, excavated from the base of mountain near the city of Qom, would provide Iran a base to pursue a weapons programme that was impervious to aerial attack. The two steps would reassure the international community that Iran had no intention of developing a warhead. Iran says its 20%-enriched uranium is essential to make isotopes for medical purposes. The six-nation group argues that Tehran already has a stockpile that would last its medical reactor 10 years and that its proposals would offer the Iranian a guaranteed supply of 20%-enriched fuel rods for that reactor. The current of the US intelligence community is that the Iranian leadership has not made that decision. Jalili has made it clear that his priority from the talks is to obtain relief from sanctions, particularly from a European Union oil embargo due to take effect on 1 July. European negotiators have made it clear that that embargo is not on the table in Wednesday's talks aimed at agreeing a framework of a confidence-building deal on 20%-enrichment. It was not clear last night whether Jalili would agree to a package that did not include any lessening of the growing sanctions pressure on the Tehran regime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/12/japan-earthquake-tsunami-eyewitness-tokyo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-12T15:19:42Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake and tsunami: 'we had no idea how much worse it would get.'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/12/japan-earthquake-tsunami-eyewitness-tokyo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/12/japan-earthquake-tsunami-eyewitness-tokyo","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake and tsunami: 'we had no idea how much worse it would get.'","bodyText":"On 11 March this year, the eastern coast of Japan was hit by the most powerful earthquake in its history. The subsequent tsunami caused a series of nuclear meltdowns which have poisoned food and water supplies and left countless people with radiation sickness. Almost 16,000 people died in the disaster, although many remain unaccounted for. Henry Green interviewed Carin Nakanishi, a Japanese student who was in Tokyo during the disaster. Thirty hours later I would be standing in a supermarket wearing a mask and sunglasses, hoarding supplies for a nuclear meltdown. But at one o'clock I was on my lunch break. I was interning with a team of Tokyo architects and, with two Swiss and Canadian friends, was sampling a new cafe. We spent an hour tasting each other's pasta and discussing plans for our night out. Back in the office, I was making models when the first tremors started. I put my craft knife down as the whole room felt the smallest of shakes, and people started murmuring about an earthquake. The tremors grew stronger but there was no screaming and nobody really seemed to panic. Looking around me, I saw three walls stacked to the ceiling with objects that could potentially fall on me so I moved to the nearest table. I wanted to take cover underneath it, but felt too stupid to cower under there while everybody else stood calmly by their desks. The rattling noise grew more violent and I kept telling myself if it got a little bit worse, I would take cover. My survival instinct, screaming at me to run and hide, felt ridiculous compared to the calmness of the other people in the office. It was even more terrifying glancing out the window and seeing the adjacent building move in the opposite direction, while the electric wires swayed like trees in a hurricane. Then, just like it had started, the tremors receded and finally stopped altogether. Everyone around me felt seasick and even older people said it was the biggest earthquake they'd ever been in. It was my first, but I knew somewhere else in the country other people had had it worse. There was a disconcerting sense of calm after the quake; some people resumed their work while others tried the phone lines. Not knowing what to do, I returned to the office, and to my model. Then, it started all over again. Having taken up my post by the table, I was told by a colleague to hold up a shelf, as files were falling from it. Again, disregarding my instinct and all logic, I did as the others were doing: holding up inanimate objects that could potentially kill us. The shaking gradually grew more violent, and we had no idea how much worse it would get. The idea that we had somehow sailed out of a storm suddenly seemed ridiculous. There was no storm to sail out of: the Earth was spasming beneath our feet, and we were pretty much vulnerable as long as we were touching it. I don't know how to describe the shaking, but when it ended I just felt seasick. Everyone immediately went back to work and I was sent to carry on with my model making. Then a second, equally violent tremor hit. A tsunami had been mentioned shortly after the first earthquake. I asked if it had come already and if people would be OK. Those in my office laughed and said, \"Of course!\" No one could have guessed what was happening a few hundred kilometres further north. The phone lines were down and news was trickling through websites, but we refused to believe the first videos we saw of the wave swallowing a van. But it must have happened because of the earthquake we had all felt. The fact that it was the biggest earthquake in Japan's history reached us. I looked out the window but pedestrians were going about their errands as before. Everyone's main concern seemed to be facing Tokyo's rush hour without any public transport. Using Facebook, I'd managed to contact a family friend who agreed to pick me up. Most people, however, were making their four-hour walk home along crowded pavements. I had invited my fellow interns, as they could not understand a single word on the news and were equally shaken. Everyone lightened up as we hurtled through Tokyo in a vintage Ferrari. I remember laughing at one man roller-skating home, only for my friend to stop the car and offer him a lift. The novelty of the journey distracted us from what had happened and we went home blissfully unaware of what was really going on. As soon as I walked into my house, this illusion was broken. Strangely for a Japanese house, everyone was wearing their shoes inside, and had their coats on. Their ashen faces told of the real disaster hitting Japan. Every TV channel was broadcasting the same harrowing footage of about 600 people on the roof of an evacuation building, surrounded by fire and flood water. The authorities were powerless to help, and we watched on as tragedy ensued. It is that image that will stick with me longest. There was an awful realisation that those people burning in an office block had felt the same violent throes as us, the same initial calm, and, but for a few hundred kilometres, their story could have been ours. The morning brought further panic. The next day, I knew turning on the news would only bring worse stories. But the inexplicable explosion at Fukushima could not have been predicted. The news programmes were broadcasting it two hours after it had happened, and we had no idea how quickly the radiation would reach Tokyo. No useful information was being offered by the government or the media, so we prepared ourselves with instructions from the internet. Wearing wet masks, covering every inch of our bodies and wearing non-fibrous clothing that we would discard before re-entering the house, we set off to buy enough supplies in case we couldn't leave the house again. As nuclear waste lasts around 24,000 years, shopping for a potential nuclear meltdown was not easy. Questions like: \"what do you buy for a nuclear meltdown?\" popped into my head. I decided oats and vegetables were a good bet. In hindsight, it sounds ridiculous. But I really didn't know if I would see fresh uncontaminated food again. Anything could have been happening over in Fukushima, and no one knew what that was exactly. The next morning, the never-ending nightmare seemed to worsen. Rain was predicted on Monday, which would have brought the radiation to Tokyo, so we locked up our house and were on a train to Kyoto in the west within few hours. The sense of relief when arriving in Kyoto is indescribable. The knot in my chest loosened, the shops were fully stocked, and the residents hadn't even felt any tremors. A few days later I flew back to London, where I live, but had nothing to take as I had realised nothing is really necessary in an emergency. However, I did take the memory of those few days with me. My body would react to the slightest vibration, be it a car driving past my window or a Starbucks fridge. The world's media has moved on from Japan, but this disaster is not over. The psychological scars that millions of others have will hopefully heal. But food supplies are ruined and children have been exposed to radiation. In so many ways, this disaster was not mine. So many people died and lost their entire families, that to pretend otherwise would be crude and insensitive, but it is important that these stories continue to be shared. Like the quake itself, the tsunami and subsequent meltdowns have had severe aftershocks, and there's no certainty that Japan will recover from it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-what-must-be-said","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-05T21:18:17Z","webTitle":"Günter Grass: What Must Be Said","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-what-must-be-said","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-what-must-be-said","fields":{"headline":"Günter Grass: 'What Must Be Said'","bodyText":"What must be said Why have I kept silent, held back so long, on something openly practised in war games, at the end of which those of us who survive will at best be footnotes? It's the alleged right to a first strike that could destroy an Iranian people subjugated by a loudmouth and gathered in organized rallies, because an atom bomb may be being developed within his arc of power. Yet why do I hesitate to name that other land in which for years – although kept secret – a growing nuclear power has existed beyond supervision or verification, subject to no inspection of any kind? This general silence on the facts, before which my own silence has bowed, seems to me a troubling, enforced lie, leading to a likely punishment the moment it's broken: the verdict \"Anti-semitism\" falls easily. But now that my own country, brought in time after time for questioning about its own crimes, profound and beyond compare, has delivered yet another submarine to Israel, (in what is purely a business transaction, though glibly declared an act of reparation) whose speciality consists in its ability to direct nuclear warheads toward an area in which not a single atom bomb has yet been proved to exist, its feared existence proof enough, I'll say what must be said. But why have I kept silent till now? Because I thought my own origins, tarnished by a stain that can never be removed, meant I could not expect Israel, a land to which I am, and always will be, attached, to accept this open declaration of the truth. Why only now, grown old, and with what ink remains, do I say: Israel's atomic power endangers an already fragile world peace? Because what must be said may be too late tomorrow; and because – burdened enough as Germans – we may be providing material for a crime that is foreseeable, so that our complicity will not be expunged by any of the usual excuses. And granted: I've broken my silence because I'm sick of the West's hypocrisy; and I hope too that many may be freed from their silence, may demand that those responsible for the open danger we face renounce the use of force, may insist that the governments of both Iran and Israel allow an international authority free and open inspection of the nuclear potential and capability of both.

Financial support for fledgling renewable energy industries has increasingly come under attack in recent months, but the new data shows that the older industries benefit to a far greater extent. Gas, oil and coal prices were subsidised by £3.63bn in 2010, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , whereas offshore and onshore wind received £0.7bn in the year from April 2010. All renewables in the UK benefited from £1.4bn over the same period, according to data from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). The government argues that investing in wind, marine, solar and other renewable energy sources will help meet the nation's legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as providing economic opportunities for the UK and a more diversified and less volatile energy supply. It points to rising global gas prices as the major reason for the sharp rise in home energy bills in recent years. Opponents argue investing in renewables is unaffordable in this economic climate. The Treasury was unable to provide figures for the tax relief and other subsidies enjoyed by fossil fuels, but the OECD data is described as \"very robust\" by subsidies expert Peter Wooders, who worked for British Gas and is now at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. Almost 90% of the fossil fuel subsidy comes from the reduced rate of VAT paid by households. Wooders said if such price cuts were intended to reduce energy costs for poorer households, they were a \"very blunt tool\" with many better-off people also gaining. \"Just about any other way than fossil fuel cost subsidies will be more effective,\" he said. Gas, which dominates home heating and electricity generation in the UK, received about £3bn in subsidy, with oil getting £500m and coal £72m. Wooders said the purpose of subsidies should be to reduce the cost of new – rather than existing – energy sources: \"You want renewable subsidies to reduce the cost of the technology, so you have better options going forward.\" Support for renewables in the UK comes mainly via an obligation on electricity suppliers to provide increasing amounts of renewable energy, paid for by a levy on energy bills. Feed-in-tariffs – direct payments for green power such as those for solar power – account for just 1% of the total subsidies to renewables. Green electricity benefits from the price cut delivered by the reduced VAT rate but, while no data is available on the sum, it will be far smaller than for gas and coal, which provide 85% of UK electricity, compared with 6% for renewables in 2010-11. No comprehensive analysis of subsidies provided to each energy technology exists with, for example, no data on the cost of subsidising red diesel, used in agriculture and industry by about 70p a litre (about 50%) or on export credit guarantees given to British companies who have recently ventured into deep-sea oil drilling off Brazil and coal mining in Siberia. Other subsidies include the millions of pounds of free coal given each year to former British Coal miners and their families, a scheme that has cost almost £1bn since 1994 and is not expected to end until 2064. \"It's incredible that as millions of families across Britain are feeling the squeeze, George Osborne is handing billions of pounds of taxpayers' money to some of the biggest and most polluting corporations in the world,\" said a senior Greenpeace campaigner, Joss Garman. \"Whilst ministers are transparent about the relatively small sums they are using to support our emerging clean energy businesses, in contrast there's no openness about the staggering amounts they're spending on huge fossil fuel and nuclear corporations.\" Most of the Decc's budget is spent on decommissioning nuclear power stations and managing nuclear waste, which cost taxpayers £7bn on 2010-11. Nuclear power is expected to benefit from the forthcoming carbon floor price, receiving perhaps £50m a year, and possible tax exemption on uranium. Anti-nuclear campaigners also claim that \"hidden subsidies\", such as the limit on an operator's liability for accidents, are worth billions. The UK's greater subsidies for fossil fuels mirrors the global situation, with the International Energy Agency recently showing that, in the 37 countries it analysed, oil, gas and coal received $409bn (£261bn) in 2010 compared with $66bn for renewable energy. Wooders noted the IEA analysis excluded support for the exploration and recovery of oil and gas, which he estimates to be worth about $100bn a year, and that fossil fuel subsidies have not been declining in recent years. But the pressure to remove such subsidies is growing: the G20 pledged in 2009 to phase them out in \"the medium term\", with President Barack Obama pledging the same this month. The issue is also on the agenda for the global environment summit in Rio de Janeiro this June, 20 years on from the Earth summit. Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP, has backed wind power subsidies. \"People forget the government supported the oil and gas supply chain in its early days: with generous tax incentives, training programmes, strategic infrastructure; and supportive regulation,\" he said in 2011. \"The result today is a world leading industry, creating jobs in manufacturing and engineering across the UK.\" Others have called for far greater support for the green economy, by direct investment of some of the money created by the government through so-called \"quantitative easing.\" The economist who coined the phrase, Professor Richard Werner, now at Southampton University, said: \"The staggering £325bn [of QE to date] has largely ended up with the banks in the futile hope that it would result in a substantial increase in UK lending to business. To ensure that this does not happen again, we need a different kind of QE, to help the wider economy directly and to implement some badly needed green projects that would enhance the sustainability of the economy and improve the environment—as well as creating thousands of new jobs.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/corporate-sponsorship-dirty-funding-opportunity-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-01T13:35:01Z","webTitle":"Corporate sponsorship: dirty funding or an opportunity for change?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/corporate-sponsorship-dirty-funding-opportunity-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/corporate-sponsorship-dirty-funding-opportunity-change","fields":{"headline":"Corporate sponsorship: dirty funding or an opportunity for change?","bodyText":"The involvement of major corporate sponsors in the Olympics has sparked some ferocious criticism. Some see sponsorship as tarnishing the whole spirit of the Games. Others argue that to take money from businesses involved in oil, or nuclear power, or sugary drinks, or any one of a number of other controversial areas, makes a mockery of London's claims to be the \"greenest Games everr\". And many see the exclusive rights awarded to the sponsors – along with what some pretty draconian efforts to enforce them – as smacking too much of bullying by the big boys. These are all legitimate questions which deserve an answer. And while the Olympics might be the most prominent example of big player sponsorship around at the moment, it's hardly alone. There are any number of initiatives which rely in part on funding from corporate partners – including Guardian Sustainable Business (GSB) and Green Futures Magazine. For the Olympics organisers, Locog, the answer is clear. No sponsorship investment, no Games – at least, not remotely on the scale we'd expect. But sponsors don't just balance the books, says head of sustainability David Stubbs, they bring valuable support in working towards its sustainability goals. \"Our strategy and policies were clearly set out before our sponsors signed up [and they all] have to adhere to these standards.\" Stubbs sees delivering the Games as a journey for everyone involved. \"We are learning from each other,\" he says, \"and setting new standards as we go.\" To the cynic, of course, this might sound like so much well-meaning fluff. But that would overlook the numerous examples of genuine pioneering practice that have been fostered by those partnerships. Like them or loathe them, companies such as Coca-Cola, BP, BT, BMW, UPS and others are using London 2012 as a test bed for some undeniably ambitious initiatives in everything from sustainable sourcing to community engagement; from new fuels to breakthroughs in renewable energy. And Locog has badgered and cajoled its suppliers into sourcing locally where possible, and where not, has tried to ensure that factories meet some pretty stringent minimum standards for ethical and environmental practice. It's a tribute, if that's the word, to the relentless scepticism of the British media that many such stories remained resolutely untold. But any lapse received headline billing. In the Green Futures special edition, Beyond the Finish:Can London 2012 give sustainability a sporting chance? we tried to give a fairer picture of the progress under way. Like all our specials, it's made possible by the support of a number of partners. Some of these are trusts and NGOs, others government bodies, and many are businesses. In the case of Beyond the Finish, they include several of the London 2012 sponsors – a number of whom, incidentally, have also supported GSB. We're completely open about their involvement, and the fact that, without this support, we would not have the means to produce and distribute publications like Beyond the Finish to a wide range of readers in business, government, the media and elsewhere. The same is true of Guardian Sustainable Business as a whole. This site, along with all of GSB's events, wouldn't exist without corporate partners. But are we both compromised by association? Are we little more than corporate lapdogs, jumping up and down to do our paymaster's bidding? I don't remotely think so. We are emphatically not giving a blanket green stamp of approval to all of our partners' activities. Far from it. Every single Green Futures and GSB partner – along with the vast majority of businesses large and small – engages in some activities that are, at present, completely unsustainable, and which need to change. So far, so familiar: there is no shortage of activists keen to point out their shortcomings – and quite right, too. But each one of these businesses also has the potential to be a wholly sustainable company – even if that might involve some radical departures from present practice to achieve it. And there is a distinct lack of lively, credible coverage of positive stories which show just they can achieve towards this end if they choose to do so. Their initiatives around the Olympics, as featured in Beyond the Finish, are clear examples of progress towards that goal. They deserve recognition. We hope our coverage encourages others to look at ways to emulate, and improve upon them. Some might argue that, were it available, funding from another source – government or charitable, say – would be preferable; would in some way be \"cleaner\". I am not sure this is the case. Some of the largest contributors to tax revenues, for example, are companies which cause huge damage to the environment. And some charitable trusts are themselves endowed with money earned through not exactly sustainable means. Meanwhile, when it comes to working with business in general, one thing is certain, if our society is to make the decisive, rapid shift towards a sustainable future which is so urgently needed, then we need business – including the world's major corporations – to play a key role in making that happen.

Even if we saved electricity, we couldn't send the surplus to Tokyo. So it's not really my problem.\" Despite a hint of underlying Osaka-Tokyo tension in his words – the west-east division in Japan is as marked as the north-south one in England – there was some truth in what he said. Emotionally, all Japanese people were horrified by the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear meltdown. But in practical terms – the damage, the clean up, the radioactive fallout, the electricity shortages – this was a particularly eastern Japanese crisis. Nearly five months on, however, the nuclear crisis has also become western Japan's \"problem\". Understanding the reactions of people living beyond the immediate vicinity of Fukushima highlights the ongoing political fallout of the disaster. At a rural supermarket, for example, a pregnant woman points to a hastily erected sign and asks the assistant, \"You're absolutely sure that this beef doesn't come from Fukushima?\" Her concern follows news reports in mid-July that radioactive caesium exceeding legal limits had been discovered in beef products transported from Fukushima to many parts of the country. For customers like her, hundreds of miles from Tohoku, radioactive contamination was no longer an abstract danger appearing on the evening news; it was now before them on the dinner table. The beef irradiation scare occurred even after politicians and media commentators had explicitly reassured the Japanese public that the government was monitoring food safety. There has been much discussion since March of the ways that Fukushima exposed the \"safety myth\" of the Japanese nuclear power industry. But the wider \"authority myth\" is now crumbling, with ordinary people not knowing whether to trust the word of anyone in authority. This trust deficit has been exacerbated by revelations not only from Fukushima, but also in recent weeks from Japan's westernmost nuclear plant in Genkai, Saga prefecture. Like many other plants, Genkai has had two reactors in temporary shutdown while regular inspections are undertaken (only 19 of Japan's 54 reactors are currently in operation). As local residents debated whether to support the restarting of Genkai's reactors, news emerged that Kyushu Electric Power Company had instructed its employees to try and influence feedback to a televised Q&amp;A session on the Genkai problem in late June, so as to create the impression of widespread public support for the \"restart\" campaign. Last week, the Saga prefectural governor admitted meeting Kyushu Electric officials several days before the broadcast and mentioning his own concern for \"pro-restart\" voices to be heard. The Genkai story line is depressingly familiar, involving covert attempts to manipulate public opinion and the perceived collusion of senior politicians and nuclear officials. The institutional behaviours that enabled the nuclear power industry to gain such political influence in the decades preceding Fukushima appear not to have changed, once more undermining trust in politicians and nuclear bureaucrats. Meanwhile, on 13 July, Naoto Kan, the prime minister, announced his vision for a \"society that can work without nuclear plants\" – a boost for anti-nuclear campaigners, it might seem. In fact, the message has been undermined by the lame-duck authority of the messenger, whose resignation is apparently pending and whose leadership is widely castigated. In all this uncertainty over future policy direction, the governor of Yamaguchi prefecture, also in the west of Japan, has temporarily rescinded planning permission for Japan's newest nuclear plant in Kaminoseki. Kaminoseki has already splashed out on the generous government subsidies granted to nuclear-host communities, as illustrated by a plush new hot spring resort being built in the town centre. Such subsidies will end if construction of the Kaminoseki plant is mothballed or cancelled, plunging the town into a financial crisis. But as townspeople grumbled during their annual summer festival two weeks ago – a festival also funded by the central government – how will Kaminoseki survive without the subsidies? It's the same question that residents in Fukushima and Genkai asked themselves more than 40 years ago. Their solution then – build new nuclear power plants – inadvertently led to a crisis that is now very much everyone's problem. • This article was commissioned after a suggestion by dierobdie.

A recent opinion poll found that a mere 2% of the public agreed with him. Neither are right. The prime minister's dilemma is that he knows most people want clean energy and cherish nature, hence his detoxification of the Conservative brand by hugging huskies and urging people to \"vote blue, go green\" before entering No10. But a significant section of Tory supporters despise action on climate change and environmental problems as expensive nonsense. Nick Clegg represents the first group, and argues \"going green has never made so much sense\", while George Osborne represents the second, railing against \"saving the planet by putting our country out of business\". The result was that Cameron's long-awaited remarks ended up appealing to both sides at once. He warned sternly how expensive renewables are, like Osborne, but was simultaneously \"passionate\" about the vital importance of growing renewable energy, like Clegg. This confusing double-speak is the crux, as it means nervous investors turn away from the UK and plough their money into countries whose green committment is not in doubt. The case for this being the greenest government ever rests on the coalition's impressive array of bold, if imperfect, policies. A green investment bank (that can't borrow), the huge green deal energy efficiency scheme (which risks low take-up), major reform of the energy market (which is too skewed to nuclear power) and the world's first scheme for low-carbon heating (delayed for homeowners). But hundreds of billions of pounds of investment are needed to replace the nation's dirty and ageing infrastructure with clean, sustainable power plants, homes and cars, fit for the 21st century. And the companies being asked to stump up need political certainty. The case against this being the greenest government ever is this missing political certainty. One senior energy executive told me Osborne's remarks drove his CEO to ask: \"Does this mean we should not be investing in renewables in the UK?\" The CBI offered doubled-edged praise for Cameron's attempt to address the issue: \"It will help to repair investor confidence following recent policy uncertainty\". Virtually all other business and green groups slated it. The prime minister's cause was not helped by a baffling, last-minute downgrading of his words from a \"major keynote speech\" to seven minutes of introductory \"remarks\" at a clean energy summit. Before the general election he couldn't stop talking green. After, we had to wait two years for him to break his green silence and if this was a \"major\" intervention, as one green quipped, I'd hate to see a minor one. Even more baffling is this. If there is a single thing Cameron, Clegg and Osborne all crave more than anything else it is economic growth. Yet while the UK double-dips into recession, the green economy is expanding at 4% a year and already employs more people than teaching. But the prime minister's failure to sing its praises with full voice and at every opportunity is stunting those precious green shoots. This government has put the foundations in place to be the greenest ever, but while Cameron puts the interests of the Tory fringe ahead of the interests of the nation, it will be the greenest government never."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2011/aug/08/greens-renewables-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-08T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Greens must not prioritise renewables over climate change | George Monbiot and Chris Goodall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/aug/08/greens-renewables-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/aug/08/greens-renewables-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Greens must not prioritise renewables over climate change","bodyText":"Before considering the case that Jonathon Porritt makes, \"Why the UK must choose renewables over nuclear: an answer to Monbiot\", we should ask ourselves what our aim is. Is it to stop climate breakdown, or is it to engineer the maximum roll-out of renewable power? Sometimes it seems to me that greens are putting renewables first, climate change second. We have no obligation to support the renewables industry – or any other industry – against its competitors. Our obligation is to persuade policy-makers to bring down emissions and reduce other environmental impacts as quickly and effectively as possible. The moment we start saying we won't accept one technology under any circumstances, or we must use another technology whether it's appropriate or not, is the moment at which we make that aim harder to achieve. Porritt is right to say that we could meet all our electricity needs through renewables. But it would take longer and cost more. He acknowledges this by setting his date for decarbonising the electricity supply through renewables and efficiency alone at 2050, while the Committee on Climate Change is seeking to do so, through nuclear, renewables, efficiency and some carbon capture and storage, by 2030. When the government's statutory advisers propose a shorter timescale for cutting emissions than one of Britain's leading greens, we should ask ourselves some hard questions about our priorities. The longer it takes, the less likely we are to prevent runaway climate change. If we shut the door on nuclear power, we create a generation gap. As the committee points out, the maximum likely contribution to our electricity supply from renewables by 2030 is 45%, and the maximum likely contribution from carbon capture and storage is 15%. Where will the balance come from? To my utter amazement, Porritt's answer appears to be unabated fossil fuel. I say \"appears\", because something odd happens in the paragraph in which he discusses it. He first proposes that the generation gap should be filled by more gas plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS), but then acknowledges that CCS is \"hugely expensive … and still unproven at scale.\" He then points out that \"gas is relatively cheap, relatively easily available, and relatively easy to build.\" This, as he has just acknowledged, applies only to gas without CCS. So what exactly is he calling for as his \"generating bridge\"? Gas with or without CCS? It looks as if a fudge has taken place here. He talks of \"frittering away at least another decade in pursuit of some unattainable nuclear dream\". But nuclear power is eminently attainable. Unlike CCS, it has already been proven at scale and will produce low-carbon electricity from the outset. The likely outcome of Jonathon's contradictory bridge proposal is that we fritter away another 40 years, in which CO2 emissions rise because we shut down and failed to replace our nuclear power plants. In one respect we in the UK are fortunate: someone else is making these mistakes, and we have an opportunity to learn from them. The someone else is Germany. In last week's New Scientist, David Strahan points out that Germany's decision to shut its nuclear plants will, despite its massive investment in new renewables, create an extra 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide between now and 2020. That will cancel out almost all the savings (335Mt) brought about in the entire European Union by the new Energy Efficiency Directive. In June, Angela Merkel announced that she would bridge the generation gap caused by shutting down nuclear plants by doubling the volume of coal-fired power stations Germany will build over the next 10 years. Outrageously, her government will help pay for them with a fund originally intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This shows what a fix you can get yourself into when getting rid of nuclear power takes precedence over dealing with climate change. This isn't the only respect in which Porritt suggests we should follow Germany's disastrous precedent. He also wants us to repeat its experiment with solar power. He claims that \"Germany plans to generate 50% of its daytime electricity from solar by 2020 – with installed capacity of 52 GW.\" Keep an eye on that word \"daytime\". Daytime on certain hot sunny days perhaps, but this does next to nothing to solve the supply problem. In 2010 Germany had an installed capacity of 17.3GW of solar power. This produces about 2% of its year-round electricity. So 52GW, which will be installed at an astronomical cost, is likely to produce around 6% of its total supply. What's more, much of the electricity it generates will be of little use. Peak electricity demand in the UK (and presumably in other northern European nations) takes place at 5-7pm on a winter's evening, when solar panels are producing nothing. Peak solar output takes place in the middle of hot summer days, when demand is much lower. Solar electricity in a cold, high-latitude country displaces none of the coal and gas plants currently producing electricity on winter evenings. The money being spent on it is largely wasted. An analysis by the Breakthrough Institute finds that the entire German solar sector produces less than half the power that Fukushima Daiichi – a single nuclear complex – generated before it was hit by the tsunami. To build a Fukushima-sized solar industry in Germany would, it estimates, cost $155bn. To build a Fukushima-sized nuclear plant would cost $53.5bn. And the power would be there on winter evenings. Porritt dismisses the detailed cost estimates produced by the Committee on Climate Change. In doing so, he relies on the strangest of sources: a note of just 400 words written by Andrew Broadbent, a man whose job is \"modelling the competition between shopping locations across Great Britain, to predict where people will shop in the next few years.\" This would be an odd choice under any circumstances. It's stranger still when you find that the two main claims Porritt extracts from Broadbent's note – that \"the principal source for the committee's estimates\" is the figures prepared by its consultants Mott MacDonald in June 2010, and that \"Mott MacDonald produced a new report in May 2011 which pretty much contradicts its own 2010 report\" – are flat wrong. The cost estimates the committee uses actually come from Mott MacDonald's 2011 report. This shows the importance of reading the source material, and not relying on other people's interpretation of it. If you are going to accuse someone else of \"inadequate research\" and \"untrustworthy sources\", your own work needs to be a lot more robust than this. Porritt warns that \"considerable scepticism is warranted in assessing the reliability of estimates from the industry\". He's right, and this is why I avoid them in favour of figures from independent bodies. If only he did the same. He relies for his estimates of solar costs on a study (by Ernst &amp; Young) commissioned by the UK Solar Trade Association. Worse still, the study's predictions for the reduction in solar costs come from \"UK solar industry data\". If ever there was a case for \"considerable scepticism in assessing the reliability of estimates from the industry\", here it is. Porritt goes on to discuss the hidden subsidy nuclear power enjoys as a result of the lack of insured liabilities. The figures he uses are, to say the least, very odd. The study he cites prices a worst-case (level 7) disaster in Germany at over €6 trillion, whereas the maximum projected cost of the level 7 Fukushima disaster, even assuming that the government buys all the land and property within 20 km of the plant, is $245bn. Could the study's scientifically-groundless estimate have anything to do with the fact that it was commissioned by the German Renewable Energy Federation? What happened to that \"considerable scepticism in assessing the reliability of estimates from the industry\"? But if unfunded liabilities are a killer argument, where does this leave the extra CO2 that will be produced by abandoning nuclear power? Who's insuring us against the impacts that will cause? With nuclear power you get a small chance that things will go badly wrong. If they do, a small number of people could – in the worst possible case - die, and several hundred square kilometres would need to be evacuated. Beyond a certain level of climate change there is a very high chance – approaching certainty – that things will go badly wrong. When they do, they have the potential to kill hundreds of millions of people, and to necessitate the evacuation of much of the earth's surface. No one's insuring us against that. There's plenty more I could say on all the points Porritt raises, but I've already gone on for far too long. My point is that abandoning nuclear power at a time of escalating greenhouse gas emissions is far more dangerous than maintaining it. To abandon it in the knowledge that much of that power will be replaced with unabated fossil fuel is even worse. It is hard to think of any issue with greater moral consequences. We have a duty to get this right, using reliable evidence, not wishful thinking. • A longer version of this article is published on George Monbiot's website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/aug/03/drone-probe-sellafield-silos-hexacopter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-03T17:59:02Z","webTitle":"Drone to probe Sellafield silos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/drone-probe-sellafield-silos-hexacopter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/aug/03/drone-probe-sellafield-silos-hexacopter","fields":{"headline":"Drone to probe Sellafield silos","bodyText":"A small drone is being developed for use at some of the oldest radioactive silos at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site because scientists are not sure what is inside them, the Guardian can reveal. The hope is that an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could use laser profiling to map the inside of the chambers and make work easier for experts who are trying to make them safe as part of a decommissioning and cleaning process. The company responsible for Sellafield asked the University of Warwick to develop a UAV for the task and is funding the programme. \"We were told not to expect it to come back out,\" said Richard Seager, the university's business development manager. There are more than 1,000 installations at Sellafield, a 6 sq km site in Cumbria that has been the hub of the UK's nuclear industry for decades. A multibillion-pound clean-up operation is under way at the plant where a number of old ponds and silos, many dating back to the 1950s and 60s, have been causing greatest concern. Some of the ponds contain highly radioactive waste that has been stored in water. Cladding and fuel rods were often thrown into the ponds and the sludge that remains is toxic. \"Sellafield doesn't have a huge amount of confidence about what they have inside some of these buildings,\" said Seager. \"They want to send some kind of craft into these places to do a detailed survey and they approached us to develop a UAV.\" The university has built a \"hexacopter\", which has six separate rotary engines. It is also equipped with lidar (light detection and ranging), remote-sensing technology that uses lasers to create detailed three-dimensional images which can be viewed from any angle. \"The hexacopter can scan the interior surface. It is can be autonomous and it will fly for about 20 minutes,\" said Seager. \"The craft was designed for the mapping of the interiors of buildings. Its USP is mapping inside buildings that may have been contaminated, or are difficult to access by other means. The model has potential military spin-offs. In Afghanistan, you could send it into an building and do a survey so you'd know who and what was inside.\" The government committed £73bn to clean up Britain's nuclear sites and most of this has gone to Sellafield, which includes the nuclear facilities previously known as Windscale and Calder Hall. The area was first used for the production of plutonium for atomic weapons after the second world war, and the UK's first full-scale nuclear power station opened close by in 1956. Buildings that have been cause for anxiety include one named B30, which was once described by a Sellafield executive as \"the most hazardous industrial building in western Europe.\" Sellafield Ltd, the company responsible for waste management on the site, admitted it was looking at using a UAV and blamed \"poor record-keeping during the 1950s\" for the fact the contents of some buildings remained a mystery. Last week scientists at Sellafield were given a demonstration of the hexacopter and suggested some modifications. However, the company refused to go into details about the work. In a statement, it said: \"Sellafield Ltd has sponsored the development work at Warwick University of a hexacopter, because we are interested in the potential for the technology to be used as part of our decommissioning mission. \"No decision has yet been taken as to how useful the hexacopter could potentially be and we are some way from making a decision on whether this could or would be deployed at Sellafield Ltd. Our research and development team within the technical directorate often funds work by academics and scientists that it thinks has the potential to be of use to us in the future. Often ideas and projects go no further than the development stage.\" Drones are now being considered for use in a number of civilian and military fields. The US military research agency, Darpa, has commissioned a hummingbird-size drone, equipped with a camera, from the firm AER. A Dutch firm, Green X, builds drones that fly by flapping wings and are disguised as falcons or hawks. They have been used to patrol at low levels around Schiphol Airport to scare away geese, preventing planes sucking birds into their engines on take-off or landing. Green X is now working on multiple drones to simulate and redirect bird flocks. Drone research is even using sophisticated biotechnology. Darpa has implanted gold-plated electrodes into the pupae of tobacco hawkmoths with the intention of learning how to control animals remotely. There is also interest in such work in the UK. The Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which works out of Porton Down in Wiltshire and at other locations, this summer produced a briefing on current research \"to stimulate new lines of thought\". The review references a US patent on an 'animal sensor network\". The US study, it said, aimed to develop a \"method for the remote guidance and training of free-roaming animal sensor networks\". It continued: \"Electrodes implanted into the nervous systems of animals are used to provide clues and rewards by stimulating specific regions of the the brain to induce desired behaviours such as the direction and speed of movement. Each animal carries a backpack containing wireless networking equipment, sensors, and data storage and processing equipment.\" Animals, it suggests, could be trained in odour detection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"observer-ethical-awards/campaigner-of-the-year-shortlist","type":"article","sectionId":"observer-ethical-awards","sectionName":"Observer Ethical Awards","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-23T14:23:00Z","webTitle":"Campaigner of the Year: top ten shortlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/observer-ethical-awards/campaigner-of-the-year-shortlist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/observer-ethical-awards/campaigner-of-the-year-shortlist","fields":{"headline":"Campaigner of the Year: top ten shortlist","bodyText":"Our final nominees for the OEA's Campaigner of the Year are a mixed bunch of exemplary human beings, dedicated to improving a lot of others and the planet.

Sir David Attenborough For many of us voting here, our understanding of planet Earth (and desire to do more to protect it) will have been shaped, inspired by or inculcated by Sir David Attenborough, the world's leading natural history programme maker. The way he tells it, his broadcast career happened by accident when he stood in for a zoologist colleague on camera. In the early days it certainly involved some hurried reptile loans from London Zoo. I went to the zoo and asked could they lend me a cobra and some others and they put them in a sack and I took them back to the studio,' he told the Observer in 2009. Today's filming techniques and ability to access areas of the earth and get close up to species are worlds' away from those rudimentary programmes, but Attenborough has maintained an extraordinary sense of wonder and curiosity. As the ecological backdrop has worsened he has also become a vociferous campaigner against Climate Change and over population. Sir David is a trustee of the British Museum and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge; a fellow of the Royal Society and was knighted in 1985.

Hugh is pretty dynamic for a downshifter. The old-Estonian son of a cookery writer he went to Oxford, worked briefly in conservation in Africa and then explored his love of cooking working in the kitchens of the legendary River Cafe. However he lacked, he said, the \"speed, skill, discipline or tidiness of my fellow chefs'. In 1997 he downshifted to rural Devon and the River Cottage experiment began. His success lies in his brilliant ability to kick the tyres around the theories and politics of the Good Life and test sustainability by living it. This experiential technique has transferred brilliantly to the screen, mainly on Channel 4; the network has been his constant campaigning companion getting issues from Battery Farming to the 'scandal' of fish discards into the mainstream. He is one of the few people who can make an on-screen telephone conversation with Tesco electrifying because he refuses to kowtow to big business. Highlights of his campaigning work include Hugh's Chicken Run where he crammed 2500 live chickens into a tiny shed for 39 days and watched what happened. Not only did he make himself cry and Jamie Oliver feel sick, but he changed the purchasing habits of millions; supermarkets reported shortages of non intensively reared chicken. His Fish Fight campaign recently scored a huge victory when the EU voted for a ban on the throwing of healthy fish from boats back into the sea.

In 1962 he embarked on a peace walk from India to the four capitals of the nuclear world: Moscow, Paris, London and the US. All his work is underpinned by Gandhian values of action through non violence and Kumar has now worked for half a century building a movement for sustainability, social justice and spirituality with its headquarters in the UK. He is editor of Resurgence magazine which last year merged with the Ecologist, bringing two much loved green publications together. He is also founder of the highly influential Schumacher College in South Devon, which has provided something of a lifeline for environmental activists and therefore for the planet. The film: as we say, no Hollywood blockbuster (yet) but plenty online of Satish Kumar's elegant take on human scale sustainability such as this Guardian clip The books: many and profound The magazine: this year marks the 40th anniversary as Kumar as Resurgence editor. Vote now – voting closes 10 May Caroline Lucas MP Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, is the UK's first ever Green Party MP. Between 2008 and 2012 (she stood down to devote more time to parliamentary duties) she was also the first elected Leader of the Green Party for England and Wales. Before the OEA's Most Ethical Politician category was retired, Lucas was voted winner by you the reader every year. She campaigns to keep climate change, environmental protection and animal welfare high on the political agenda, for renewables above nuclear power and for action to eradicate fuel poverty. She was at the forefront of last year's successful campaign against the government's planned badger cull, and instrumental in a parliamentary report calling for a moratorium on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides linked to the decline of bee populations. Lucas abstained from the Commons debate in memory of Margaret Thatcher saying, '\"I opted to spend my time working on constituency issues rather than join in the seven-hour display of Tory hero worship in the House of Commons for someone who caused the British people so much misery'.

Frequently referred to as a National Sweetheart and other fond clichés, she has proved herself a born campaigner moving effortlessly between championing the rights of Gurkhas or teaching us to shwop our troubled wardrobes towards sustainability. A longtime advocate for animal welfare (plus, let's not forget a three time BAFTA winner) the woman who gave us Purdey and Patsy has proved to be a great leader of social justice and environmental campaigns who is never ever preachy.

Convinced 'not all your answers are lying at the bottom of an agri-chemical bucket' he turned the farm organic. In 1993 he delivered the first Riverford organic veg boxes out of the back of his Citroen. Little did he know he was securing his place in fruit and veg history. Riverford now delivers 40,000 boxes of organic produce a week across the UK. 'From the outset, my aim has been to produce organic food with flavour, look after my team, my suppliers and the land, and encourage people to eat seasonally,' says Watson who is prone to rail against ideologies of conventional business such as 'unbridled capitalism'. His highly principled stance attracts many gongs: Riverford has picked up three retailer and business category OAEs and Watson was voted BBC Farmer of the Year 2012.

Previous to 1971 when she opened her first boutique with Malcolm Maclaren and set about defining punk and New Age, Westwood was a school teacher. This background serves her well now as she spends an increasing proportion of time teaching about a planet in peril. She has given lectures at the UN, notable science festivals, implored consumers on mainstream chat shows to stop consuming (an interesting position for a fashion designer) and told the Duchess of Cambridge to stop wearing new clothes in favour of a bit of wardrobe recycling. She favours mixing climate change science with Voltaire, Huxley and design principles - arguably bringing much needed design flair to green politics. She is a devotee of James Lovelock's gaia theory. 'I consider Lovelock to be a genius as important as Einstein or Darwin,' she has said. Westwood has given £1 million to help support Cool Earth, the charity founded by MP Frank Field and businessman Johan Eliasch. The idea is to raise money to secure rainforest land, essentially pricing deforestation out of the market. Her central theory is that we should 'Get a Life! Then not only will you be off the consumer treadmill, you'll have a tremendous anchor in life, and be engaged enough with the world to fight for it'. She believes culture is the best defence against 'endless distraction' that prevents us from campaigning effectively. 'Get a life. Get A VISION. Get an idea!' urges Vivienne. 'Freedom fighters need ideas. They can't just be angry at everything.'

Malala Yousafzai, grew up with her family in the mountain city of Mingora, in the Swat Valley, Pakistan. By all accounts she demonstrated a virtuosic gift for language and reason from a young age. While Malala's zest for knowledge grew, the Taliban were determined on violently removing her right to education. She refused to be silenced. Aged 11 she began a diary of her experiences navigating a daily war zone posting 35 entries of an extraordinary blog for the BBC, under her pen-name, Gul Makai (the name of a Pashto folk hero). \"They cannot stop me,\" she told a film crew, \"I will get my education, if it is home, school, or any place. This is our request to all the world. Save our schools. Save our world. Save our Pakistan. Save our Swat.\" They tried to stop her in the most violent way possible. On 9 October 2012 as Malala sat on the school bus, she was shot at point-blank range by a Taliban gunman. The bullet grazed her skull and damaged the soft tissue underneath that controls the face and neck. 'I am Malala' read the signs at candlelit vigils in Pakistan in the aftermath of the shooting. In the UK Birmingham doctors have reconstructed Malala's left jaw and facial nerves. The young woman has become a global symbol for a girl's right to education. On 12 July she will be 16, an occasion she'll mark with a speech in front of 4000 young people in New York on the right of young people to an education. She is the youngest nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize in history.

The decision will have impact far beyond just the wind sector. If Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change prevails, and keeps the cut to the 10% for onshore wind that was previously agreed within government on the basis of the evidence and consulted upon, the industry can continue its rollout to deliver the relatively low-cost, low-carbon energy the UK needs. If the chancellor George Osborne, with David Cameron's blessing, succeeds in driving through the 25% cut I reported he wants, another heavy blow will be dealt to the confidence of energy investors. That matters given that the government wants those investors to fund a complete overhaul of the UK's energy infrastructure, left creaking after two decades of underinvestment. \"Industry's willingness to invest is clearly damaged by such changes,\" said Tim Yeo, chair of the house of commons energy and climate change select committee. \"There is clearly a lot of politics in this now,\" Yeo told me after his committee's evidence session on the costs of wind power on Tuesday. \"If it comes in at greater than 10%, the government needs to provide the evidence that justifies this. Otherwise the suspicion would remain that decisions were being taken on non-energy-policy grounds.\" That is an allusion to the growing revolt in the shires against onshore wind, led by the 100 Conservative MPs who demanded David Cameron drastically cut the subsidy. The committee was told by Professor Robert Gross of Imperial College London: \"It is being turned into a political decision, when it should be an economic and technical decision, which must be transparent. The evidence suggests that 10% is a perfectly resonable figure.\" A 25% cut would be a \"false economy\", according to David Handley, chief economist at renewable energy developers RES, as it would mean more expensive low-carbon energy, such as offshore wind, nuclear power or carbon capture would be required, or more exposure to international gas prices that have tripled since 2000. \"The opportunity for large wind investment is the UK's to lose,\" added William Heller, of Falck Renewables. The session slayed a number of wind myths, none more elegantly than that of the cost of the back-up gas power stations needed to balance the variable supply of renewable energy. David Kennedy, chief executive of the government's official advisers, the committee on climate change, said that with 40% renewables on the UK's grid by 2030 (as is needed to meet carbon targets), just 5% gas back-up is needed. Futhermore, with 85% of the cost of electricity from gas being from operation, keeping them idle is much less expensive than often supposed. Kennedy added it was even possible to get 50-60% renewables on the grid \"with still very little unbated gas generation needed\". The MPs also saw the polarised nature of the onshore wind debate when anti-turbine campaigner Adrian Snook appeared to overwhelm himself with his own emotional rhetoric. \"The goodwill of the British people has been abused by ill-thought through policies. In Daventry district the wells of resentment have overflowed ... into a lake of resentment,\" he said. \"Local people should be treated with respect and dignity,\" he added, before choking. There was more. \"It is very difficult to negotiate with developers on the basis of 'resistance is futile',\" he said, having been asked whether discussion could solve local disputes. \"How do you think people feel when they lie there at night listening to the sound of the turbines? The farmer hears money dripping into a pot, but people feel violated.\" As I have reported before, the violation of a sense of place by outsiders is a serious issue, one completely flunked by the UK, where less than 10% of renewable energy is community owned. The discussion led onto possible community benefits. prompting MP Barry Gardiner to ask Snook a puckish question: \"How much cheap electricity is your dignity worth?\" Snook replied: \"The compensation has to be greater if the loss is greater, if the affront to dignity is greater.\" As it happens, it is illegal in many cases to provide free electricity to those living near turbines, as a way of sharing the benefits. But Yeo said: \"There is clearly interest in developers being able to give people a cut via their electricity bills. We could add and amendment to the energy bill to explore that.\" Such a move would be a small step forward in solving, as we must, the wind wars. But a move to slash the wind subsidies by 25% would be a huge step back in the greater war, that against climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/french-election-blog-2012/2012/apr/13/france-election-fringe-philippe-poutou","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-13T16:49:44Z","webTitle":"Philippe Poutou has no ambition to be president.

So why the equal billing?","bodyText":"If French voters are asking themselves why Ford car worker, union leader and anti-capitalist Philippe Poutou is standing in the presidential election, they will hardly be reassured to learn that so is he. The genial Poutou, 44, who could be described quite fairly as one of the fringe fringe candidates, astonished viewers of a television programme featuring four rival candidates on Wednesday night by declaring that he \"never wanted a political career\". He said he was only standing because a predecessor had told him \"go on, it's your turn to do it and be pissed off\". We are seeing a lot more of Poutou, candidate for the New Anti-capitalist party, these days thanks to one of the quirks of French presidential elections that means as voting day approaches, a law kicks in giving every candidate equal air time on radio and television. It's not just the length of time they're given, but the quality … meaning no shunting the no-hopers off to midnight slots. Thus, some 3.4m people watched Poutou, who is forecast to get between 0.5% and 1% of votes, admitting that political campaigning was \"harder than working in a factory\", that it wasn't a \"dream or personal ambition\" to become president and \"for eight months he'd been pissed off having to give interviews\". In fact, he added, he woke up every morning and thought \"Shit, I'm a candidate!\" (Judging by audience figures it was more compelling viewing than the French Cup football match on a rival channel.) Poutou's campaign broadcast is equally irreverent, featuring a gameshow in which two contestants have to guess the name of the anti-capitalist candidate. One keeps guessing \"General de Gaulle\". The other, when told the candidate works in the automobile industry responds \"Schumacher\". The French media isn't quite sure whether to laugh or criticise Poutou's \"sense of humour and ability to poke fun at himself\", as one French magazine described it. Poutou stands no chance of being elected, and doesn't want to be. Like the other no-hope candidates he is using the election to air his party's political views. These are a national retirement age of 60, a wage increase of €300 a month for all workers, a minimum monthly wage of €1,700, a 32-hour working week, a ban on all redundancies, requisition of the banks and an end to nuclear power. Poutou is at least pragmatic. Although opposed to the mainstream left Parti Socialiste, he says he will support its candidate, François Hollande, in an eventual run off with Nicolas Sarkozy. \"Today, what we say is that we must remove Sarkozy and his entire gang,\" he told Le Monde. After his television performance on Wednesday night, the audience applauded; an extremely rare occurrence in a political debate. If this happens Poutou may find himself picking up the sympathy vote. He certainly raised a laugh by explaining his discomfort at being in the spotlight. \"I'm not used to being on my own. When we go and invade the boss's office we do it in a group,\" he said. \"When we occupy, it's as a group. We go on strike as a group\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-20T07:09:51Z","webTitle":"Global Warning: 24 hours on the climate change frontline as Trump becomes president – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president","fields":{"headline":"Global Warning: 24 hours on the climate change frontline as Trump becomes president – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re just a few hours from Donald Trump being inaugurated as the president of the United States, and we’re signing off from our 24-hour Global Warning live blog: a marathon effort from our Guardian offices in London, New York and Sydney, as well as our correspondents dotted around the globe. What we’ve seen, as we’ve travelled around the world, is that regardless of what climate deniers (yes, deniers) like Trump may say about the science, the stark reality is that it is happening now. Both scientists and people at the front lines of climate change – in low-lying Pacific islands where freshwater supplies are being contaminated by salt; in poor farming Cambodian communities, where “life is a high-wire act with no safety net” – agree: there is no ambiguity. We are no longer fighting to stop climate change, but fighting to stop a runaway catastrophe. Governments must step up and take action. But in the meantime, we must all do what we can. We’ve heard people fighting climate change all around the world give their advice for what individuals can do, and most of them said similar things: become active on the issue, make your views known to politicians, and become a climate voter. Exactly what the Trump administration means for the world is not yet clear, but even if the Paris Agreement is weakened – even if the work is undone – not all hope is lost. There are signs that China might take a lead on climate change action, and investment in renewable energy around the globe seems unstoppable now. Thank you for joining us in our Global Warning project, and particularly those of you who have contributed to it in the comments or on social media. We’ve been struck by the thoughtfulness and nuance of your discussion; on the whole, it’s hard not to feel a little more optimistic. “For those standing on the precipice of life the impacts of climate change are an ever present reality,” writes Anika Molesworth, a young Australian working at at an agricultural research centre in Cambodia. She writes that the poorest farmers in Southeast Asia are those most vulnerable to climate extremes and seasonal vagaries. “For these farmers, many who live at subsistence level and survive on less that $1US a day, life is a high-wire act with no safety net. One stroke of bad luck – a drought, flood or pest outbreak – and they tumble further into hardship. … “Not a day goes by that I don’t stand in awe at an under-resourced team committed to moving mountains despite the odds lined up against them.” Much of the way we discuss climate-change mitigation focuses on supply: how to produce more energy, more cleanly. But some of the most fascinating conversations about climate-change in India are about reducing demand. India is a society undergoing enormous changes. Between now and 2040, the population of its cities will swell by an estimated 315m people – roughly the current population of the US. Over the next years, the estimated 240m Indians who currently lack access to electricity will be connected to the grid. The half-billion Indians who still rely on fuel wood for cooking will transition to using stoves. And by some rough projections, around 70% of the buildings that will exist in India in 2030 are yet to be built. Experts such as Navroz Dubash aren’t just thinking about how to power these changes, but how to lock in systems – of moving, cooking, cooling and lighting – that use a fraction of the energy it takes to power the same tasks in the west. One example he gives is appliances. The Indian government has started paying rebates to manufacturers who can produce more energy efficient 40-watt fans to reduce the drain during the nation’s sweltering summers. A bigger example – hundreds of thousands of high rises will spring up across Indian cities in the next 15 years. Energy researcher Radhika Khosla points out: building them to capture natural sunlight will reduce dependence on electric light. These opportunities exist across every sector. Investing in rail freight networks would use less energy, long-term, than trucking freight by road. Convincing Indians to cook using gas, instead of electricity, would also substantially cut energy use. Transport emissions too could be slashed if the hundreds of millions of Indians who flood into cities in the next decades could work within a short distance of their homes. “There’s a way to lock in institutional changes, technological changes and behavioural changes that are very difficult to undo,” Khosla says. “And that opportunity exists for countries like India, that are on the verge of great transitions.” Now we move to Mongolia, which is experiencing a disaster called a dzud, an extreme weather phenomenon commonly comprising heavy snow falls and temperatures below -40C. The dzud starves livestock as they are unable to graze, which in turn can devastate Mongolians, a third of whom are entirely dependent on livestock. The country used to suffer dzuds every decade or so but recently they have been occurring with growing frequency. This one is the second in a row. The full extent of the dzud will not be known until the end of spring but last year’s killed more than 1.1 million livestock and left hundreds of thousands of Mongolian herders living on the brink. Months of consistently heavy snow coverage and arctic temperatures have sparked fears of another devastating humanitarian crisis. The government has called for donations of warm clothing, food, medication for livestock, coal, hay, animal feed, insulation materials and other useful items for herders to help them survive the winter while preventing livestock deaths. Some areas of the country have already recorded temperatures as low as -50C and local media reports that more than 70% of Mongolia is covered with thick snow and ice. A dzud typically arrives after a summer drought or an early winter snow that melts then freezes over the land, cutting off food for livestock. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and insufficient grasslands for large herds of livestock. Telmen Erdenebileg, Save the Children’s humanitarian program manager in Mongolia, is leading the organisation’s dzud response and has just returned from one of the worst affected provinces, Arkhangai. “The coming months are critical for herder families in the most heavily impacted areas. The end of winter is when stores of hay and fodder run out, and if there’s another large snowfall or temperatures remain so low we could see massive numbers of animals dying of starvation once again,” he told the Guardian from Ulaanbaator. “Just last week herders told me how they lost half or even three quarters of their herd last winter, and they are worried about what awaits them in the next few months. Livestock are everything out there: a source of food, nutritious milk, warm clothing with their skins and a commodity for trade or sale. Without animals, herders have no livelihood. Last year, Save the Children’s response to the dzud included distributing animal fodder and veterinary packages, fuel to help hospitals and schools, and cash grants for the most vulnerable families to buy essentials like warm clothing and nutritious food. Suppakorn Chinvanno, at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, has been creating maps that show dramatically how temperature changes will affect the Southeast Asia region, if high CO2 emission continues. Below is a map of Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, as well as parts of Myanmar and Malaysia. It shows the average daily maximum temperature from 1980 and projected to 2090. Chinvanno says the map suggests the region – already vulnerable to droughts and floods – is going to suffer more extreme and more frequent “abnormal weather patterns”. That’s to say, much longer dry periods with intense heat that could devastate agriculture, of which about a third of the population currently relies on. That said, rainfall could actually increase, he says, but it will come in shorter bursts with more intense downpours. His climate change model also suggests a possible half-metre rise in the sea level in some areas of Thailand, which will magnify flood risk along the coast. Over the past year, Thailand has been experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades and rice farmers are struggling. As we heard earlier, this was followed by terrible floods, one that killed 25 people this month and cut off large areas of the country. The below map shows the average daily minimum temperature during the same period, displaying how it will not only get much hotter but parts of the country will hardly cool down, a necessity for some crops to thrive. These scenarios are based on projections in which emission remain high. But even simulations that show lower CO2 levels have a similar result. Now Chinvanno is researching adaptations, in which Thailand moves to deal with the effects of climate change by changing farming strategies, boosting flood defences and water storage practices. “What we can do is to make ourselves more resilient,” he said. We’re reaching the end of our 24 hour blog, so it’s time to check the carbon countdown clock again. This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. By the time this blog finishes, the world will have emitted an estimated 112m tons (CO2-e) of greenhouse gases. Bangladesh is already one of the most climate vulnerable nations in the world, and global warming will bring more floods, stronger cyclones. Karen McVeigh, the Guardian’s global development reporter, filed this report from the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar where the fish-drying process is well underway. It can continue through to February or March if the weather is good. But Aman Ullah Shawdagor, a dry fish (known as shutki in Bangla) businessman who employs 70 people, said that rising tides and recent changes in the seasons has hit his business. “This is a dry season business. But for the last couple of years, the rain has become more frequent.” Scientists predict that, by 2050, as many as 25 million people in Bangladesh will be affected by sea level rise.

Here’s a video Australia’s Climate Council just released on Facebook: We’ve had a few posts about the effects of climate change on coral reefs. In particular, earlier in the day we had an interview with coral biologist Anne Hoggett, who lives and works on Lizard Island, in the remote northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. She spoke about the process coral goes through when it first bleaches, and then eventually dies. Here are a set of interactive before-and-after images we have, taken from Lizard Island, that show that very process. And if you want to read an in-depth feature about the 2016 global coral bleaching event, here’s one we published a few months ago: Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. When Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister of Australia, it was hoped there’d be serious action on global warming – but the conservative government continues to fiddle on climate policy while the country burns, writes Guardian Australia’s editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor.

Tamil Nadu’s water crisis is a glimpse at the way climate change is already exacerbating environmental and political tensions in India. For future threats, go 1,300km northwest to Mumbai, India’s flashy financial capital – and the world’s climate-vulnerable megacity. To start with, much of the city was actually built on water: by rubble poured into the seas and swamps that separated seven islets in the Arabian sea. That process of reclamation continues today, and has severely distorted the terrain’s ability to deal even with unexceptional rainfall. A 2013 study found flooding would cost Mumbai around US$6.4b each year by 2050. It also means huge swathes of the city are low-lying. If sea levels rise at predicted rates, according to early research, around 40% of Mumbai could be submerged by the end of the century. A day of freak rainfall in July 2005 saw chest-high flooding in parts of the city and killed 500 people. But the real nightmare scenario is a category 4 or 5 storm blowing in from the Arabian sea. A new book by Amitav Ghosh, one of India’s best-known writers, imagines this very scenario. In the event of a two-to-three metre storm surge, Ghosh writes: “Waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm surge would meet and merge. In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once again become islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water.” Luckily, no storm like that has been seen in Mumbai in recent memory. But meteorologists are nearly unanimous in the view that increasing global temperatures will make tropical storms more severe. And a 2012 paper cited by Ghosh in his book predicts a 46% increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Arabian sea over the course of the century. Is Mumbai ready – either for “the big one”, or even just increased floods? I asked Atul Deulgoankar, an author and member of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority. He said: “I’ve been part of the disaster management authority since its inception in 2006. In that time, not a single government, not a single chief minister or chief secretary has taken an interest in disaster-risk reduction. In 2005, we experienced heavy flooding because just one river was choked. And nothing has been done about that. There has been no campaign to clear water bodies or rivers. Nothing is happening systematically.” Tim Flannery, Australian palaeontologist, environmentalist and member of the Climate Council has penned a sobering opinion piece in the Guardian today, outlining the threat climate change is posing to Australia’s unique wildlife. And as he says, meanwhile, Australia is doing very little to improve their outlook: ...while other countries are winding down their coal use, Australia is attempting to ramp up our production and export of the product, all the while as we watch first-hand the immediate and long term damage coal and fossil fuels are wreaking on our planet, on people and on nature. You can read the full piece here: Naveen Rabelli, a 35-year-old engineer, wanted to show the power and potential of clean energy, so he designed and built a solar powered tuk-tuk and drove it 9,000 miles from India to the UK. “The moment I tell them it doesn’t require petrol, their minds are blown,” he said in September last year after he arrived in Dover following a seven month-long journey. His journey shows there is a sustainable alternative for the millions of tuk-tuks around the world. Read more about Rabelli’s journey here.

If you’re just joining us, in the past hour: We’ve heard how climate change is affecting already extreme climate in Australia’s Northern Territory Deforestation, and the role it plays in carbon emissions, has been explained in a neat infographic by The Wilderness Society Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann shared his strategy on defeating climate deniers We’ve checked back in with the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef – is the Australian government really doing all it can do to save its natural wonder? A short clip on the British Antarctic Survey’s activity at Rothera research station explains the answers to be found in Antarctica Oliver Holmes has reported back from southern Thailand, where unseasonably heavy rains have marked the start of what should be the dry season And is slowing the birth rate really the solution to climate change? It may be not so simple. A reader, witness67, has suggested that a “generational solution” to climate change is to “stop breeding”. But, as another commenter pointed out, that’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all. Global population is forecast to climb steadily, reaching 8.5bn in 2030, 9.7bn in 2050 and 11.2bn in 2100 – but the overall rate has been falling since the 1970s, and demographics are shifting. The number of births have peaked, or levelled off globally; the growth in population is due mostly to people living longer. We looked beyond the top line projections in a data blog last year. Here in Thailand, the south of the country has been experiencing unseasonably heavy rains, unusual for what should be the start of the dry season. More than 25 people have died and close to a million people, or 360,000 households, have been affected, with homes submerged in water. At one hospital, 100 patients had to be evacuated on small boats after the building was hit by overflowing reservoirs. A flash flood washed out a bridge on the country’s main north-south highway, backing up traffic for 200 km (125 miles). Footage on local television channels showed abandoned cars submerged in muddy water. The railway link was also cut off and the Department Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said that the main airport in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat would remain shut for the foreseeable future. Thailand’s rainy season usually ends in November. This year, intense rain has fallen well into what should be the dry season. There is debate among scientists on the reasons for the extreme weather we’re seeing in Thailand, with many pointing to the cyclical El Niño and La Niña patterns, in which oscillations in the temperatures between the atmosphere and the ocean create storms. It’s hard to isolate the impact of global warming, but increasing temperatures will lead to longer, more intense droughts and increasingly devastating flooding. Widespread floods in 2011 killed more than 900 people and caused major disruption to business, cutting economic growth that year in Thailand to just 0.1 %. We’ve heard quite a bit about Antarctica in the blog so far – both as a career-making site for scientists and a point of ongoing exploration. There’s good reason for that. What happens in Antarctica affects us all, as this video of British Antarctic Survey’s activity at the Rothera Research Station on the western Antarctic peninsula goes to show. In the future, this landscape could be almost barren; right now, it’s a living laboratory in which to study organisms being affected by climate change. For a live look at Rothera station, check out BAS’ webcam. A few commenters have argued that Australia isn’t doing enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It’s also worth remembering that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and yet the government’s current policies leave it with no hope of meeting its emissions reduction targets. Here’s an interactive we recently made, showing the government’s own projected emissions, plotted against the reduction commitments we made as part of the Paris Agreement. Click “zoom out” to see how much we are set to miss our targets by. Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann from the University of Pennsylvania will soon be visiting Australia as a guest of the Sydney Environment Institute and speaking at the University of Sydney in February. Ever since he and his colleagues did pioneering work, gathering temperatures from various records over the past 1000 years, and plotted them on a graph that became known as the “hockey stick graph”, Mann has been at the centre of a vicious fight between climate scientists and climate deniers. Ahead of his visit, I asked him over email about the role of climate deniers in Australian politics and what concerned citizens can do help stop climate change. Question: You’ve spent a long time battling with climate deniers. In Australia, we have a number of climate deniers both in the government and in the rest of the parliament. We also have a federal government that has no effective policies to curb carbon emissions. Do you think climate deniers are driving climate policy here in Australia. And if so, what is the best strategy to fight them? Michael Mann: Sadly, climate change deniers do indeed continue to have a voice in our public and policy discourse that is out of proportion with the merit of their views, thanks in large part to a megaphone that they have been granted by conservative media. The Murdoch media empire in particular – whose role is featured in our recent book ‘The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy” — has played a particularly vital role in the climate change disinformation campaign, and they dominate the news industry in Australia. Keep in mind that the second largest shareholder in NewsCorps, after Rupert Murdoch, is the Saudi Royal family, who obviously have a stake in our continued addiction to fossil fuels. As a consequence, they dominate the public discourse and provide cover for climate change-denying politicians. It is hardly surprising this has led to climate policy in Australia being driven by fossil fuel interests and their advocates. As for strategies to fight them, one of them is to speak out and to hold them accountable—which is something I do actively, whether it is speaking to the media, giving public lectures, writing commentaries and op-eds, and books. My ‘Madhouse Effect” lecture is really about how to move beyond climate change denial and get on to the legitimate debate about what to do about the threat of human-caused climate change. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Michael Mann: We must hold our elected representatives responsible for representing our interests rather than the profits of polluting interests. Among other things, we must make sure to vote, and to be climate voters. A few people have mentioned the big role land-clearing plays in climate change. In Australia, it’s a big issue, with improvements made in previous years looking like they’re going to be undone, with new laws in Queensland and NSW making land clearing easier. The folks at The Wilderness Society have just put together this graphic, explaining the issue nicely. In Australia’s Northern Territory climate conditions are already extreme, with high heat, floods, monsoons, cyclones, and fires, and its economy relies heavily on industries affected by climate, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. But it doesn’t have much of a plan to deal with the effects of climate change, says David Morris, head of the Environmental Defenders Office. He tells the Guardian there have been some “positive noises” from the newly elected Labor government around renewable energy and increased funding and incentives, but notes that it’s one of the few jurisdictions without an adequate and current coastal management plan. “I doubt you could find many capital cities around the world that don’t have a coastal management strategy, that don’t have a climate change adaptation plan, and the Northern Territory is a place which is going to feel the effects of climate severely. “New roads, new pipelines, housing development, any kind of infrastructure you want to put in, any kind of decision you want to make under legislation where you’re spending public money, should now take into account climate change. “When you look at NT government information about climate change, it’s scant, there’s basically nothing. I mean, we’ve got sea level rise and that’s it.” Morris says current estimates are a sea level rise of 1.1m by 2100 would see between 250 and 400 residential buildings inundated by seawater, and would put 200km of NT roads, valued at just under AU $2 billion, at risk. Ecologically and economically significant tourism areas like Kakadu national park are also under threat, with increasing risks of saltwater intrusion threatening the fragile wetlands. We’re in the final stretch now. Here’s what we’ve covered in the last hour: The first-ever all-female expedition to Antarctica asks the question: is climate change a gender equality issue? Blair Palese, the chief executive of 350.org Australia, on how climate change deniers take their tactics “straight out of the tobacco playbook”; 350.org’s campaign against the Carmicheal coal mine; and what you can do to help combat climate change China correspondent Tom Phillips takes his air pollution-monitoring “egg” for a walk around Beijing – and runs into Boris Johnson The sperm bank that could hold the secret to saving the world’s coral reefs We’d love to hear more from you below the line, or on Twitter: I’m at @mlle_elle, Mikey is @MikeySlezak, and we’re using the hashtag #GlobalWarning. It’s also been some hours since you were last made aware of a penguin. And here’s the final part of our Q&amp;A with Blair Palese, chief executive of 350.org Australia. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Blair Palese: I think it’s important that we all take responsibility for climate change as we’ve all been part of the system that created it. We have the power to decide who governs us and what issues made the priority agenda no matter what vested interests do or say to stymie action. And as consumers we have huge power to decide where our money goes. Anyone concerned about climate change needs to engage in politics, call your elected officials, email them, meet them at events and tell them you want urgent action or you’ll vote them out. Talk to people about it in your community, take steps together locally to make a difference. And think hard about what you are doing with your money. If you don’t like what your bank or superfund is investing in – say fossil fuel projects – tell them that and move to one that is fossil free. Finally, get involved with a group or issue you care about – help us stop the Adani coal mine, take on Chevron’s plans to drill in the Bight, switch your power company from the big three to a company investing in and campaigning for renewable energy. If you don’t have time, donate to keep the campaigning alive. Any one of these steps will make a real difference. Here’s another part of the Q&amp;A I did with 350.org Australia’s chief executive Blaire Palese. Here she discusses the recent suceses of the climate movement, and what we’re going to see this year. Question: Despite some big setbacks, the climate movement has claimed some victories too. It now looks like the whole movement in Australia is focussing on stopping Adani building the Carmichael Coal mine. What will that campaign look like? Blaire Palese The divestment of more than A$6 trillion (US$5.2 trillion) from fossil fuels is something I and the 350.org team are particularly proud of. The campaign started off very much as a symbolic effort. But much to our amazement after three years, it was all about money – and lots of it! – being moved from coal, oil and gas. Some 688 institutions and 58,399 individuals across 76 countries have committed to divest in some way. This is a real indicator that people are frustrated with government inaction and are taking their own steps to be part of the climate change solution. The Victorian gas ban could not have been achieved without a strong coalition of farmers, rural communities and city progressives that became a force that could not be ignored by the Andrews Government. Getting BP to drop plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight was a different story, with environmental groups using delaying tactics and the threat of a global public campaign to ensure the project was too costly and unviable. Right now, efforts to stop Adani from building the world’s largest new coal mine in Queensland is, for most of us concerned about climate change, the most critical fight in the country right now. Australia hasn’t opened up a new mineral reserve in 40 years, and if the Adani project goes ahead, the whole Galilee Basin could be developed, which would unleash enough coal to tip the carbon budget not just for us, but for the whole world. A broad coalition of environmental groups, local communities and Traditional Owners are coming together to do all we can to ensure this project doesn’t see the light of day. If you’d like to do something about climate change, join us to stop this climate-threatening coalmine! While the Queensland state government has said it’s doing all that it can to preserve the Great Barrier reef, a different kind of preservation work has been ongoing far from the reef – even the coastline – in regional New South Wales. Since 2011, scientists from Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Smithsonian Institution have been collecting and freezing coral sperm to store at Taronga’s CryoReserve in Dubbo. The project began in Australia in 2011, but has international partners that ensure the preservation of coral reefs worldwide. “It’s a bigger collaboration than just the Great Barrier Reef,” said coral scientist Bec Hobbs. By freezing the cells in liquid nitrogen to preserve them indefinitely, scientists can use similar technology as sperm-banking for human IVF to grow new coral and make entire reef systems more resilient to coming change. Researchers are also investigating the possibility of freezing coral eggs and larvae. There are more than 600 species of coral on the Great Barrier Reef – in the last spawning event in November, scientists were able to add four more to the bank, said Hobbs. “At the moment we have samples from about a meagre 11 species, but that is still the most species that are banked anywhere in the world.” But their efforts to collect more species have been frustrated by lack of knowledge about reefs and coral reproduction. “We know quite a bit about certain species and others, relatively nothing,” said Hobbs. The research currently being carried out by Reef Recovery Initiative partners, then, is all the more vital for preserving the future of reefs. Our correspondents around the region have been monitoring the air quality in their various cities. While Beijing is usually incredibly smoggy, Tom Phillips is reporting unusually blue skies and remarkably low PM2.5 readings. But when Tom descended into the subway, things didn’t look so great. Blair Palese is the chief executive of 350.org Australia. I asked her a series of questions about the climate movement here and abroad. Here’s the first question and answer: Question: The rise of Trump in the US, and the continued lack of federal action on climate change here in Australia, must be seen in some ways as a failure of the climate movement. What lessons can be learned from what’s happened in recent years and how can the climate movement win? Blair Palese: Climate change is an incredibly difficult issue for people to get their heads around. Complex, yes, but more importantly, made confusing by media with vested interests questioning climate change science – a tactic straight out of the tobacco playbook. Understanding that science is never 100% certain is not something most of us think much about, so it’s easily exploited. And, as our movement is up against the most cashed up industry in the world – the fossil fuel industry – it’s a David vs Goliath battle to convince people and politicians that the longer we wait, the harder and more expensive are the steps we must take to stop climate change. That said, those working on the issue do need to reach out more broadly to everyone, everywhere about the importance of the issue and ensure our movement spans the political, race, gender and age spectrum to be truly representative. It’s worth remembering that the People’s Climate Marches of 2015 saw more than 600,000 people take to the streets in 175 countries -- by all accounts the biggest thing of its kind in history. Our job now is not only to raise the alarm about climate change but to communicate the huge benefits we will all get from solving it. Our voices need to be loud and varied if we are to successfully stand up to fossil fuel dollars. Come back soon to see some more Q&amp;A’s with Blaire. The Homeward Bound Project aims to take 1000 women working in science around the world to Antarctica to increase their influence and impact in policy and decision-making. Belinda Fairbrother, the community conservation manager at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, was part of the inaugural contingent of 76 women to spend 22 days in Antarctica in December: the largest-ever female expedition to Earth’s southernmost continent. She said the impacts of climate change were keenly felt there, with the Antarctic peninsula was among the fastest-warming places in the world and penguin populations suffering. “It really brings home the challenges we face elsewhere in the world.” Having met scientists at Palmer Station, a US station in the Antarctic, she realised that no progress was possible alone, and that storytelling was as important as facts in mobilising people to act. “In these remote landscapes, that’s what really struck me – we need to work together, past issues and conflict. Going forward, that radical collaboration is what we’re going to need to deal with climate change as a global issue.” Hearing personal accounts of knowledgeable people experiencing the effects of climate change firsthand and working to combat them helped to mobilise her, said Fairbrother: “Data’s only going to get us so far. … Climate change is real but what’s also real is people’s innovation and ability to stand up to issues like this.” Fairbrother also said her experience had shown her that gender equity and more equal decision-making was a key part of the solution to climate change. The Homeward Bound Project aims to elevate each participant’s leadership capabilities and profile with view to addressing underrepresentation of women in positions of power and influence, “to impact policy and decisions towards a sustainable future”. There are already hundreds of women waitlisted for the second program, to depart in 2018. We started on Lizard island and went all the way to China, by way of the Tumblrverse and a possible planet populated only by carp. “There’s no time to lose”: a coral reef scientist urges governments to act on carbon emissions Street violence over water supplies not some future dystopia, but a present reality in Tamil Nadu, southern India John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, comments on the slow-moving gains of climate policy China correspondent Tom Phillips reports back from one of the largest solar farms on Earth in Qinghai province Millennial lobby group Generation Zero gets to advocates young in New Zealand The worst mangrove dieback in recorded history in Australia’s Northern Territory, and the ramifications for that coastline Smog from China aggravates a severe air pollution problem in Hong Kong Mikey Slezak looks to the future Calla Wahlquist with the latest on “fire behaviour” analysis in Victoria, Australia’s most fire-prone state China doubles down on its pledge to cut carbon emissions – no matter what the Donald may do Meanwhile, here’s the carbon countdown again – only 27.5% of the total carbon budget remaining in tons (CO2-e), if we want to to limit human-induced warming to less than 2C. And here’s a thoughtful response to CassandrasVoice’s earlier question about how long – specifically – we’ve got before climate change has severe enough impact on the majority for us to act. Li Shuo, a Beijing-based campaigner for Greenpeace, is among the activists hoping that China, the world’s largest polluter, will take up a greater leadership role on climate change in a post-Trump world. Li is an expert in clean energy, air pollution and climate change and also studied US-China relations at Nanjing University in east China. Writing in the Guardian today, Li argues that Trump’s election “casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation” but says Beijing’s apparent willingness to take on a larger role offers some hope. You can read Li’s full piece here: I recently sat down over Skype with the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, David Ritter. I pressed him on whether or not the election of Trump in the US meant that the public has stopped caring for climate change. He was adamant that was not the case. “There’s much that might be said about this election but i don’t think we can in any way treat it as a mandate for inaction,” he said. “One of the sad ironies of protest electoral votes may be that some of those who have been most left behind by an economic system that is deepening inequality, and are lashing out and voting for candidates seen as anti-establishment, are also people that are at the greatest risk from global warming when we see extreme weather events, we see extreme temperatures and so on. So I don’t think there’s any doubt that inequality and climate change are intimately, intimately connected.” Check out the full video below.

The war on global warming is “a responsibility we must assume for future generations,” Chinese president told the world’s economic elite in Davos this week, signalling that Beijing would stay true to its pledge to cut carbon emissions, even if Donald Trump did not. China has several reasons for sticking to its guns. Firstly, there is consensus in China that the country is likely to be among the biggest victims of climate change: a 2015 government report warned rising sea levels, temperatures, and rainfall posed a real and present danger to hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens. Melting glaciers in China’s extreme west and the desertification of large swaths of land in the north have set alarm bells ringing in Beijing. Secondly, Beijing understands it must take action against deadly episodes of air pollution that are fuelling increasing public rage. China’s leaders view climate change mitigation as an effective argument with which to take on the powerful energy sector responsible for the smog, which is blamed for up to one million premature deaths per year. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Beijing sees huge economic benefits in transitioning towards a consumption and services based low carbon economy and becoming a world-leader in the energy technologies of the future. Already its global dominance of the renewables market is becoming clear through billions of dollars of overseas investment last year in countries from Australia to Brazil and Pakistan. China is now the world’s largest investor in clean energy and recently unveiled plans to pump more than $360bn into renewable energy sources by 2020. Finally, there is the question of soft power. With a climate denier now occupying the White House, some in Beijing see a golden opportunity to boost China’s global standing by spearheading the war on global warming. Xi’s speech at the World Economic Forum - in which he urged the world to “meet the challenges of climate change” and praised the Paris climate deal as “a hard-won achievement” - suggests China may be preparing to do just that. “History,” the Chinese president told his audience to loud applause, “is created by the brave.” Lightning struck bushland east of the coastal Victorian town of Wye River on 19 December, 2015. On 25 December the fire burned the town, destroying 116 homes. Most of the residents had already been evacuated on the order of fire authorities, who mapped the fire behaviour, with astonishing accuracy, five days earlier. The mapping system, called Phoenix, allows fire behaviour analysts to input data about the terrain, dryness of the fuel, predicted temperatures, and predicted wind patterns, and come up with a predicted image of fire behaviour. Until 2010, this was done with considerably less accuracy using a pocket calculator and a slide-rule, crosshatching on paper maps. As fire behaviour analyst Andy Ackland explained in the video below, the mapping system also predicts the occurrence of convection currents, where a blast of hot air pushes through the inversion layer of the atmosphere. That’s one of the key conditions of a firestorm. The system is used to inform public warnings and help firefighters prioritise when there are multiple fires on the same day (bushfires tend to come in crops of 12, Emergency Management commissioner Craig Lapsley said). It is also used in a strategic sense to figure out which power lines are most likely to cause devastating bushfires. Ackland said it is increasingly used to map potential changes in bushfire risk caused by long-term climate change, which is drying out the mountain ash forests around Victoria and leaving them more prone to a severe bushfire. “Some of the most extreme fuel loads that you would see anywhere in the state are that type of mountain ash fuel,” Darrin McKenzie, deputy chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management said. Like many Australian trees, mountain ash has evolved to use fire to regenerate, shedding long ribbons of bark to create fuel. That strategy backfires in a catastrophic fire Black Saturday in February 2009, which burned hot enough to kill the mountain ash seeds and, with that, jeopardise the whole alpine ecosystem. An interesting comment below the line. Earlier today I posted an opinion piece I wrote today about panic and despair, and other emotions a lot of people feel when writing about climate change. In that piece I mention a moment I felt almost panicked, while I was half-way through James Bradley’s brilliant novel Clade, which is set a few decades in the future. Here’s something James has written for the blog today about the process of writing a book about the future of climate change, as that change was happening: Back in 2012, when I began writing the book that would become Clade a lot of what I was writing was science fiction. Although there was no question climate change was an urgent problem, or that its effects were already being felt, most of the direr predictions still lay somewhere over the horizon. Yet as I wrote a peculiar and discomfiting thing began to occur. Events I was weaving into the fabric of the novel – the release of methane from the seafloor and the permafrost, mass die-offs of wildlife, the breakup of the Antarctic ice sheets, even changes in the Earth’s rotation due to the shifting weight of melting ice – started to move out of the pages of the book and into reality. The sense of hastening intensifies with every passing day. A decade ago it was possible to say the window for stopping dangerous climate change was closing, but that’s no longer true. If you live in the Pacific, or Africa, or many other parts of the world dangerous climate change is already here. The question is no longer whether we can avert dangerous climate change but whether we can avert a runaway climate catastrophe. There are days when I wonder whether continuing to believe that might be possible isn’t simply denial, a refusal to confront the truth. Speak to any scientist working in a field connected to climate change and you will quickly encounter a deep seam of despair. What is happening is occurring so quickly, so irrevocably it often seems overwhelming. Yet another part of me knows this sort of despair is self-fulfilling. Change doesn’t come from giving up, it comes from practical action and engagement. But it also requires hope, and hope requires we believe change is possible. Hello from smoggy Hong Kong. Despite its reputation as a futuristic global city, Hong Kong has terrible air quality and the government has been slow to respond to the problem. Nearly all government pollution targets far exceed World Health Organization recommendations. In terms of PM2.5, tiny particles that cause haze and have been linked to cancer, government targets are three times higher than the WHO. Even during the best year for deadly PM2.5, levels were still more than twice WHO guidelines. Congested roads flanked by skyscrapers cause a “street canyon” effect, where pollution caused by road traffic can be trapped and recirculate, exacerbating the problem. Hong Kong’s port, one of the busiest in the world, is also a massive source of bad air. Ships are only required to switch to cleaner fuels when docked at port, so the entire journey sailing through the city’s waters is emitting high levels pollution. On top of that, almost all of Hong Kong’s power comes from fossil fuels. Lastly, let’s not forget Hong Kong’s neighbor to the north: China. Smog from China often wafts into Hong Kong, aggravating an already severe problem. About 20% of Australia’s coastline – 11,000km – is lined with 52 different species of mangroves, with more than a third of it in the Northern Territory. But last year something extraordinary occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, when scientists were informed of a mass dieback along a stretch about 700km long. It was the worst mangrove dieback in recorded history, covering 7,000 hectares, and came at the same time as the more highly publicised coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. Believed due to a combination of factors related to climate change, the mangrove dieback has serious ramifications for the health of that coastline and future erosion, but went largely unnoticed at the time. “Essentially the plants died because of moisture stress and that’s linked with a combination of factors,” Prof Norman Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, tells the Guardian. “High temperatures obviously, a lack of rainfall, and strangely also a temporary drop in sea level at the critical time when these plants were so stressed out because of the climate itself. All these factors are related to the southern oscillation index, the El Niño southern oscillation cycles, and that means that they’re related to climate in general.” Duke says the dieback and subsequent response were pretty indicative of how the issue of climate change is dealt with in the NT. “I may not be privy to all that’s going on but from my perspective, we just have to look at the example of the die back. The only reason we know is because of concerned community members sending in pictures to me and others saying: we think something’s going wrong but nobody else is interested. That took four, five, six months in 2015 from when it was first publicised.” “It’s now well over a year since the dieback started and still there is no dedicated surveys going on on the ground to establish what has gone on, the extent of it, and what we can do about it and what are the consequences, which are potentially enormous.” When Pubudu Senanayake cycles through the Christchurch CBD he feels a quiet sense of satisfaction that New Zealanders are adapting their island home of 4.5m to be more climate-friendly. A NZ $150m cycle network in Christchurch and increased rail services in Auckland are recent wins. Senanayake is a member of youth-led lobby group Generation Zero, formed in 2011 with the aim of pushing the New Zealand government to take swifter action on climate change, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by the year 2050. He says successive governments have not “understood the urgency with which we need to act”, with emissions increasing. With over 30,000 members and high-profile, imaginative lobbying action, Generation Zero campaign as vociferously for leadership from government as they do for individual choices such as eating less meat or walking to work. A number of members, “empowered to act” while at university, have gone onto work for NGOs or in government, says Senanayake. “We try to increase youth participation in the civic process and help youth gain more skills and knowledge to have an impact at the policy level.” For Senanayake and his fellow climate warriors the pay-off is clear: a sustainable New Zealand for decades to come. “Climate change is not just an environmental issue. The symptoms are environmental but the issue is social and economic. And the urgency with which we need to take action makes me pretty devoted to it.” My colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this piece from Qinghai province in western China. Tom is back from spending two (freezing cold) days there on the Tibetan plateau visiting what is reputedly the largest solar farm on earth and one of a growing number of super-sized symbols of China’s quest to transform itself from climate villain to green superpower. “The scale of the solar park is just extraordinary and building it was clearly a huge, huge task,” says Tom. “Engineers there told me thousands of workers had taken part in construction, braving temperatures as low as -20C to turn the region into a sea of silicon panels.” You can read the full piece below and come back soon for more from Tom. John Connor has been the chief executive of the Climate Institute in Australia for 10 years. In that time, he’s seen federal climate policy begin to be established, only to be dismantled and then replaced by ongoing stagnation. I spoke with him and asked him whether the lack of movement meant the climate movement had been doing things wrong, whether Trump’s election was the death knell for the Paris Agreement, and what individuals could do to help prevent climate change. Watch the video here: Parched reservoirs, street violence over dwindling water supplies, and the emergence of a “water mafia” sound like some fevered vision of a future dystopia. Except, all three are already happening in parts of southern India, and most acutely in Tamil Nadu. One of India’s wealthiest and best developed states, Tamil Nadu is nonetheless in the grip of its worst water shortage on record. This year’s monsoon brought less than half the usual rainfall. The reservoirs that supply Chennai, the capital, are at around 13% capacity – and the state still must weather six hot months before the monsoon rains returns in July. Rural areas already appear to already be in crisis: India’s human rights agency estimates at least 106 farmers have killed themselves in the past month. It isn’t all down to climate change. “The way Tamil Nadu is geographically rendered denies it access to precipitation,” says Jayshree Vencatesan, the managing trustee at the environmental group, Care Earth Trust. Mismanagement of crops and existing water resources also takes some share of the blame. But the annual monsoon season, the state’s lifeline, is bringing less rain than it used to. And when it does finally pour, the storms are intense and brutal, causing destructive floods of the kind that have ravaged Chennai each December of the past two years, killing over 300 people. And though researchers are yet to study the link, Vencatesan says the state is “consistently warmer” than in the past. “You don’t really have a great seasonality. So, you have a monsoon, that’s followed by an intense summer – and there’s an immediate drying up of the system,” she says. Tamil Nadu has been forced to beg surrounding states for help. In September, it won a legal battle with neighbouring Karnataka state for more access to water from the Cauvery, a river the two states share. But Karnataka too is desperately thirsty. The result was days of anti-Tamil violence in the streets of the Karnataka capital, Bangalore, including the torching of dozens of Tamil-owned vehicles and businesses. Demonstrators carried signs that read: “We will give blood, but not Cauvery.” Some unscrupulous water-tanker drivers have begun to exploit the situation. Vencatasan says hundreds are involved in buying water from farmers, and hauling it to villages where supplies are low. There they hock it for a steep markup. “They haven’t reached the point of forming cartels yet,” Vencatasan says. “But they are a water mafia.” We’ve collaborated with Tumblr to create a “quilt” of user-submitted messages and artwork about climate change for this Global Warning project. Here’s my new favourite submission: “A world full of carp is probably not the long-term goal”. Let us know if you disagree in the comments! After speaking with Anne Hoggett about the devastating bleaching that hit the Great Barrier Reef, I asked her what she thinks individuals can do to help stop climate change to protect the reef from bleaching. Here’s what she said: Let our government know that you want them to take meaningful action to contain carbon emissions - now. There’s no time to lose. Throughout the afternoon, we’re going to hear from a number of people about what they think individuals can do to help stop climate change. I’ve got to say, the hours are flying by as we steer the live blog back to London. It’s 1pm here in Sydney, it’s pouring down with rain, and Mikey Slezak has just inhaled a cheeseburger in between blog posts. In the past hour: Guardian Australia’s photographer extraordinaire Mike Bowers shared a shot and a story from his trip to Kiribati, featuring prominently in our coverage today as a site on the bleeding-edge of rising sea levels Jason Roberts answered just one more question for us from Casey Station in Antarctica My colleague Calla Wahlquist reported back on how Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, approaches bushfire management David Tong, now of WWF New Zealand, gave a chilling account of household items being taken by rising sea levels in Kiribati – and locals putting sugar in their water “to counteract the salty taste” We heard from Lock the Gate, a group of Astralian farmers concerned about coal mining and gas extraction Michael Safi, the Guardian’s Asia correspondent, reported from Delhi on plans for the largest electricity rollout in history Even the Sydney Opera House faces problems posed by climate change, Guardian Australia’s Joshua Robertson found A coral reef biologist who’s been based on Lizard Island in far north Queensland for almost three decades reports back on the challenges Here’s a talking point for you to deliberate in the comments: Onwards and upwards. Yesterday I spoke with coral reef biologists Anne Hoggett. She’s lived and worked on Lizard Island in remote far North Queensland for almost three decades. She is now director of the Australian Museum’s research station there. Lizard Island was at the epicentre of the disastrous bleaching that killed about a fifth of the coral on the entire Great Barrier Reef. Check out the interview below, where Anne describes what it has been like living there, and watching the impacts of climate change hit her remote home. The business case for adapting to climate change has dawned on a growing number of organisations in Australia, including the stewards of the Sydney Opera House. The opera house is among the 10 best business cases in Australia to show how it could be done, according to a Griffith University report launched last month. The climate change risks to the World Heritage-listed building range from underground water leaks from rising sea levels and water pressure, damage from more severe storms with high winds, and flooding from more intense rainfall and run-off. The opera house has now factored in a 90cm sea level rise into its 10-yearly building renewal program. Managers told the Griffith researchers that assuming the need for climate change adaptation in its investments was a responsible “use of taxpayers’ money”. Other cases include the insurer Suncorp, which sees a growing cost of natural disasters in northern Australia in the form of cyclones, floods and hail storms as “the game changer and catalyst for change and action”. Over the last seven years in Queensland alone, insurers paid out $1.44 in claims for every $1 they collected in premiums, the study said. After Queensland’s costly 2011 floods, Suncorp assessed the cost of a levee to protect the flood-prone town of Roma at $11m – the same as it cost the government to provide emergency helicopter rescues for one flood. “This presented a very strong business case for the [Queensland] government to fund the levee, which they did,” the study said. Suncorp told the researchers that while the insurance industry has a “pretty good understanding of what the cost will look like”, this did not necessarily extend to the human costs, which are only apparent when disaster hits and insurers “turn up on the ground and start helping people rebuild their homes”. “At that point, it becomes evident that there is a range of risks and damages that are not ‘carried on anyone’s balance sheet’, for instance, mental health issues,” the study said. AlexMourinho raises an interesting point: could the way forward from our changing climate be posed by philosophy? On the subject of science intersecting with philosophy, on Wednesday I went scuba-diving off the north shore of Sydney with Peter Godfrey-Smith, an academic philosopher who’s written a book about the consciousness of cephalopods. Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness is currently available in the US and due for release in the UK and Australia in February; Godfrey-Smith’s New York Times column about octopuses and ageing is a taster. Hello from Delhi, India’s heaving capital, where, inside government ministries, plans are being devised for the largest electricity rollout in history. India will need to supply power to nearly 600m new consumers by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. How they choose to do so matters to the entire planet. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, takes climate change seriously. Extreme weather across the country, including droughts, storms, and the severest heat wave on record killed nearly 1,600 Indians, it was reported this week. Food yields are already estimated to have fallen by 6% because of higher temperatures – a phenomenon that might claim 160,000 Indian lives each year by 2050. But Modi is also emphatic that climate change “is not of [India’s] making”. Historically, the country accounts for just 3% of the world’s total carbon emissions since 1890. India is unapologetic about potentially tripling its coal use by 2030 if it means connecting every village to the grid and powering new schools, jobs and homes for hundreds of millions of its citizens. Averting a catastrophic increase in carbon emissions will come down to how much of that energy can be generated cleanly. India’s renewable energy target is hugely ambitious: an installed capacity of 175GW by 2022. To put that into perspective, the current capacity of India’s entire grid is around 310GW. So far, India doesn’t appear to be on track to hit the 175GW target – but that’s missing the point. In pursuit of such a bold aim, it has already added nearly 15GW in renewable capacity, and attracted billions of dollars in investment. The southern state of Tamil Nadu is now the site of one of the world’s largest solar power plants. India’s total renewable capacity could increase by more than 50% in the next year alone. It has already predicted it will exceed its Paris targets by nearly 60% – and do so three years early. So, while the next posts will explore the threats posed by climate change to India, it’s worth remembering: there’s some cause for optimism, too. Lock the Gate is a large group of farmers and other citizens concerned about coal mining and gas extraction. They’ve successfully fought coal seam gas extraction along the east coast of Australia, and have emerged as a force to be reckoned with. The group has just released an analysis suggesting coal mining is responsible for about half the dangerous particulate pollution in New South Wales. Georgina Woods is the New South Wales campaign coordinator at Lock the Gate and has sent this in: As well as dealing with more extreme droughts as global warming worsens, regional communities in Australia are suffering localised impacts of coal mining. Lock the Gate Alliance, a network of community groups protecting their land and water from coal and gas mining, has today released analysis showing coal mining is responsible for the majority of dangerous particulate air pollution in New South Wales. Roughly half of this is created by five of the biggest mines. They’re all in the Hunter Valley – an important agricultural region, which is home to renowned wineries and horse studs. The state’s most-polluting coal mines are choking the Hunter Valley’s skies, damaging the health of local people and their children, contributing to the hundreds of deaths in NSW that are caused every year by particulate pollution. This analysis is part of Lock the Gate’s submission to the NSW’s government’s Clean Air Plan, which closes for consultation today. A big-picture question posed by CassandrasVoice in the comments: how long have we got? It’s a tough one, but if you’ve got thoughts or ideas, we’d love to hear them. We’ve heard about the impact of rising sea levels in Kiribati, and Guardian Australia’s Mike Bowers’ personal recollection of his visit there – now David Tong, now a campaigner at WWF in New Zealand, has written about his time in South Tarawa, an atoll of only 16 sq km of land, last September. It’s quite a chilling account of living on the front line of rising sea waters. “Climate change impacts are real and obvious. On my first day in Bairiki, I walked along the beach behind the President’s house. The sea wall was broken in several places, and the beach was littered with rubbish. I couldn’t understand where all the rubbish came from – were the broken TVs from passing cruise ships or something? “My I-Kiribati colleagues explained that the rubbish on the beaches had mostly come from people’s houses. With the highest point on Tarawa only 3m above sea level, storm surges and king tides flood homes, pulling people’s property back with them. Over the following weeks and months, the sea dumps its takings back on the beaches.” David Tong said that a storm surge following Cyclone Pam flooded South Tarawa’s maternity hospital, with flooding reaching hundreds of metres inland, killing pandanus trees and destroying taro pits. “I heard talk of people putting sugar in their water, to counteract the salty taste. ... Already on Abiang, the nearest outlying island to Tarawa, salt water is bubbling up from the soil at king tides.” I-Kiribati are working to develop salt-resistant crops, and President Mamau has pledged to make a plan for every community and every island. “Our choices in the rich world will decide whether that’s possible,” said David Tong, who’s returning to Kiribati in February: “The place gets under your skin.” Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, overhauled its emergency management model following the devastating Black Saturday bushfires of 9 February 2009, which killed 173 people and destroyed two small alpine towns. The result was a new control structure, Emergency Management Victoria, which operates out of the State Control Centre in Melbourne. On a day with a fire danger rating of extreme or above, or in the event of a natural disaster, the room fills up with the heads of Victoria’s fire and flood agencies. Steve Riley, manager of the centre, talked us through it. Here’s the interview: We’re going to wrap up our Q&amp;A with Jason Roberts in Antarctica now. Thanks to everyone for all the excellent questions. And thanks especially to Jason for taking the time out of his research down there to engage with us all. Apologies to those answers we didn’t get to. To close it off, here’s one last question and answer. And Jason’s answer: This is a question that we hear often, and it’s great that people are still asking it, and want to know the answer. There is some confusion around this due to the changing amount of sea ice, and confusion between it and grounded ice. The area of sea ice is changing, due mainly to changes in the ocean currents and wind, moving the sea ice around and packing it together in areas. The ice on Antarctica (the so called grounded ice) is decreasing. Like any big land mass, things vary from area to area, but overall Antarctica is losing ice. We have several independent lines of evidence to support that. The most direct way is that satellites and aircraft (including the project I’m currently in Antarctica working on) measure the height of the surface of the ice sheet using lasers and radars. They show that many of the outlet glaciers and surrounding ice catchments are lowering, which can only happen if they are losing ice. The second way is that the gravitational field of the ice can be measured from space, we can “weigh the ice sheet” and it is weighing less over time. Again like any big area, things can change from year to year, but overall the pattern is that Antarctica is losing grounded ice, and especially the smaller (and therefore quicker to respond to any changes) West Antarctic region. Kiribati: The 33 atolls and reef islands straddle the equator and are spread across an area of over 3 million square miles. The eastern Line Islands are the first place in the world to greet the sun everyday as the international date line has to bend around them so that they are on the same day as the rest of the group. For the population of 100,000 the issues facing them are complex and urgent. Extreme weather events, storm surges and tides are eroding and threatening the precious land space. More than half the population live on the main island of Tarawa. The delicate fresh water supplies that sit underneath most of the islands in what is called a water “lens” which is basically fresh water that floats on the denser salt water that surrounds the islands. The encroaching sea is making much of this supply brackish and in some cases unusable, it is also affecting the soils and in some villages the former growing areas have become a saline desert which will not support any life. Garbage and leaching from heavy metals which lie all over the islands also contaminate the precious water supplies. The infant and under 5 mortality rate sits at a shocking 56 deaths per 1000 live births (2015 UN Inter agency group) In 2014 the Kiribati Government purchased about 20 square kilometres on the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji to for Agricultural projects and fish farming. For the people of Kiribati climate change is not an argument, they live with the changes every day in complex ways that make their lives difficult and their future uncertain. They seem genuinely surprised when you tell them that there are people in Australia who don’t believe that anything is happening to the climate of the world. As I photographed Toani Benson standing in water on the ruins of a shop on Abaiang Island where he used to fill his scooter as a school child in the mid nineties remarked “perhaps you should bring those people here.” This photograph shows children bathing in one of these shallow wells in South Tarawa. Over the last 60 minutes – Readers have had their sometimes fairly technical questions about Antarctica answered by Jason Roberts via email, direct from Casey Station – thanks to Jason and the Australian Antarctic Division for their contribution Roberts commented on the seasonal closure of the British Antarctic Survey’s Halley VI research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf, announced earlier this week as a result of uncertainty over cracks in the ice We flagged a march in Sydney on Saturday, organised by Greenpeace Australia to coincide with Donald Trump’s inauguration Mikey Slezak and WWF Australia together made you even more aware of penguins on Penguin Awareness Day (let us know when you’d like us to stop) Mikey let his professionalism give way to panic (and let me just say, if Mikey’s panicking – so should the rest of us) Responding to Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from New Zealand, a reader shared a graph of 400,000 years’ data to show that the worst may be yet to come And we heard from Lisa Gershwin about how climate change may affect jellyfish To come: reporting from Australia and we’ll venture into Asia. As Matthew2012 references below the line, a British research station in Antarctica has decided to relocate its 16 staff who were due to stay there over winter due to uncertainty over growing cracks in the ice. The British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on Monday that the Halley VI research station would shut down over winter due to concerns over changes to the Brunt ice shelf. A station relocation further inland away from the chasm is already underway. Jason Roberts says: Yeah, I saw in the news about Halley VI research station having to close down over winter. The biggest factors working in Antarctica are safety and looking after the environment. You are a long way/time away from any outside help, so you need to do things properly and in a safe manner. I have never visited Halley, but imagine that it has been designed so that it can be closed down over winter and then brought back into operational order next summer, when conditions will be more favourable. The three Australian Antarctic research stations are built on rock, so luckily we don’t have to deal with this issue. I wish our British colleagues every luck with the relocation of Halley. Thanks to BettyLousGettinOut for bringing this story from 2014 to my attention. I feel quite grateful to be reporting in relative comfort from the office in Sydney (today: overcast, grey). I’ve been in touch with Australian Jellyfish expert, Lisa-Ann Gershwin – Director of the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services. She’s written this Facebbok post for us, discussing the threat of Jellyfish taking over as the climate warms. While there’s been a lot of talk of jellyfish doing well and filling the oceans, she says not all jellyfish will be winners. Another answer from Antarctica. Jason Roberts said: That’s a very good question, and slightly outside my field of study, which is strictly Antarctica, but I’ll have a go at answering it. I think there is some evidence of older ice in Greenland than 123,000 years, but none that has been successfully recovered in an ice core, and more importantly dated. In general Greenland is much closer to the equator than Antarctica, and is more sensitive to warming air temperatures, so we think that during extended warm periods it would be a much smaller ice sheet and not extend to the coast like it currently does. When you drill an ice core, because of the way the ice had flowed over tens of thousands of years, the layers of ice that fell in any year get thinner and thinner, making it much more difficult to date the bottom of an ice core. In addition, the ice slowly moves so it can get folded up (think of the patterns your can see in rocks in road cuttings), and this disturbance in the ice at the bottom can make it very hard to use the very bottom of an ice core. Another factor for Greenland is that it is much smaller than Antarctica, so it just takes less time for the flowing ice to move to the edge and be lost to the ocean. So the ice gets replaced over much shorter timescales than in Antarctica. The geothermal energy question is good. In fact there is liquid water found at the base of Greenland in places, including the NEEM core which reached the folded ice from the last interglacial period. So yes, this is also a factor – mostly it is just a question of how long it takes for new snow to completely move to the bottom of the ice and get discharged at the edges. Trust that answered your question, Matthew2012. I must admit, I’m impressed by the level of technical knowledge being displayed below the line... Below the line, Erik Frederiksen has responded to a quote from Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst from the Otago Regional Council, in Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from Dunedin, New Zealand. (The graph of 400,000 years of data Erik meant to link to is here.) Eleanor noted that 2016 was the hottest year on record for New Zealand, with droughts in the North Island and 11m of rain on the west coast of the South Island. Eleanor is based in Dunedin and says the southern university town is being seen as a litmus test for how the rest of the country may fare in the coming years, with numerous flat, low-lying beach side communities built on marshy land mere metres above the sea. “It all comes down to the fact that New Zealanders love to live by the ocean,” Dr Hornblow told Eleanor. “But if we were planning those homes with the wisdom we have today, we would not have people living there at all, or be building on those flat areas so close to the sea.” I don’t normally write about personal things, but recently I’ve been thinking about people’s emotional responses to the devastation that climate change has been causing – and will cause in the future. For years I’ve understood the crisis we’re facing, but I’ve managed to maintain a kind of professional distance from it – not feeling enormously strong emotions about it. But recently that’s change. Here are my thoughts about why. A question from Twitter this time, about a reported increase of ice and snow in Antarctica. Jason Roberts responds: Like anything involving such a big area as Antarctica, things vary a lot across the continent. From an Australian context, just think about floods and bushfires happening at the same time. In general Antarctica as a whole is losing some ice, with this mainly happening in West Antarctica (the bit on the South American side of the Trans Antarctic Mountains). On the larger East Antarctic side, things are a bit more in balance, with some areas losing ice, and some currently gaining ice through extra snowfall. Of course getting detailed measurements is difficult in Antarctica (there are only a few weather stations) so we rely a lot on satellites to make these measurements, so there is some uncertainty about just how large some of the changes are. To make things harder, things are changing with time as well – again, just think in an Australian context, some years are wetter than others. In Sydney Australia, there is going to be a march on the first full day after Trump is inaugurated. Greenpeace and other NGOs will be there marching to demonstrate on both climate change, and women’s rights. Another missive from the Casey Station on Antarctica. Jason Roberts: That’s an interesting question about the sea ice, and one that keeps coming up. While the air temperature and temperature at the surface of the ocean is important in forming sea ice, probably the biggest factor controlling how much sea ice is around Antarctica is the ocean currents (and the wind patterns over the water). These move the sea ice around, and can cause it to build up in certain areas as it all gets pushed together. Once this happens, it can influence the ocean, for example waves get damped out by the sea ice, which stop them breaking up the sea ice. So it is more to do with the changes in ocean and wind patterns than temperature. There isn’t much direct coupling between the changes in the sea ice and ice on the continent. Most Antarctic sea is only one year old (although there are areas of so-called “multi-year sea ice”), while the ice on the continent is much older, tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The things that affect the ice on the continent are the amount of snow that falls to replenish it, the air temperature over summer for melting it, and how stable the ice shelves are that help hold back the glaciers. Keep your questions coming below the line. WWF Australia has jumped on the penguin awareness day bandwagon too, and included a some punny jokes in their Facebook post. Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division has replied to CgGc13’s question below the line on the impact of the breaking up of the Lambert ice sheet. Jason says: The ice shelf that has a major rift in it is the Larsen ice shelf. Parts of this ice shelf collapsed around 10 years ago, that time is just disintegrated, while this time in looks like calving a big iceberg. The previous collapse reduced the forces holding back the glaciers that feed this ice shelf, and the speed up (more than doubling their speed) in the following years, although I think the most recent studies are showing that they are starting to slow back down. We can probably expect similar behaviour when this shelf calves this time. On a global scale, the glaciers feeding the Larsen are fairly small and don’t contain a huge amount of ice. But their significance is more that they are the canary in the coal mine, showing us how vulnerable these ice shelves are to changes in the surrounding ocean. Another hour has passed – here’s what we’ve covered: 20 January being Penguin Awareness Day, we’ve duly raised your awareness of penguins (let us know below the line if you’d like to be made more... aware) We heard how residents of the Solomon islands are working to strengthen forests, mangroves, reefs and other natural ecosystems that provide natural barriers to climate change How a seawall constructed in 1880 in Dunedin, in New Zealand’s South Island, has proved an inadequate barrier given contemporary challenges The Australian Antarctic Division’s Jason Roberts on his daily flights out over Antarctica – and what he sees And a selection of your thoughtful, interesting comments – please keep them coming! As Mikey mentioned, we’re about to hear from Jason for a real-time interview conducted – hopefully not-at-all haphazardly – between the Casey Station on Antarctica and the Guardian offices in Sydney. We’ve passed a selection of questions you’ve already left for him in the comments, but do send on some more. As mentioned below, we have Jason Roberts on standby at Casey Station in Antarctica ready to answer your questions about his work (see previous post), about Antarctica, or anything else! Fire your questions at us in the comments below or tweet them to me at @mikeyslezak. We’ll get them to Roberts and post the answers shortly. Jason Roberts is currently living and working at the Australian Antarctic Division’s Casey Station on Antarctica. Speaking exclusively with the Guardian this week, Roberts explained why he takes a plane out over Antarctica each day, measuring what’s underneath the ice. The work is trying to understand what controls changes in the ice, as the climate warms. “The last time we were in what’s called an interglacial - when we didn’t have the big ice sheets in the northern hemisphere – that was about 120,000 years ago when the climate was about what it’s like now,” Roberts says. “And all the evidence from around the world suggests that sea level was several meters higher than where it currently is.” But where exactly all that sea level rise came from is a mystery Roberts is trying to solve. Check out the interview we prepared earlier. NOTE: We have Roberts on standby, ready to answer your questions. Leave them in the comments below, or tweet them to @mikeyslezak and we’ll come back here with his responses. This comment, from NoMoreMrNice, praises the live blog form as a means of capturing the complexity of climate change. (In the interests of balance, I’ll try single out some critical comments soon, don’t worry!) As NoMoreMrNice notes, one of the challenges of reporting on climate change is making it seem like an immediate issue that’s unfolding now, rather than something intangible, far away in the future. These real-time, around-the-world updates are giving – if you’ll excuse the buzzword – a holistic view of the problem. A few commenters have suggested that we should run the blog for another 24 hours, or at least do so more regularly – though it’s dependant on resourcing of our offices in London, New York and Sydney, the warm response below the line is certainly an incentive to do so! St Clair beach in Dunedin is threatened by sea level rise. The first seawall was constructed in 1880 to protect the homes and businesses of low-lying South Dunedin, land which experts say should never have been built upon. The original seawall is evident in this picture, and was made of loose rocks and debris. The current wall is made of concrete and is six metres high. It is a great place to eat fish and chips while watching the pacific ocean hurl itself against the man-made barrier. “We have a duty and responsibility to inform people about what risks they face living in a coastal environment,” says Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst for the Otago Regional Council. “With the issue of sea-level rise we are looking at big storms increasing in frequency and severity...so people that would ordinarily have a fairly low risk of being flooded by the sea may now expect that adverse event to happen every ten years rather than every 100 years.” Thanks for all your comments below the line – it’s great to see so lively a discussion. This, from Uli Nagelb, was interesting in light of earlier debate over reference to “climate deniers” in the US: Earlier in the blog, we referred to “climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word)”; challenged in the comments, my colleague Emily Wilson had this to say: It goes to show how loaded this debate continues to be in the face of apparently indisputable facts. The question of how to bridge the gaps between the two groups remains, as pointed out in this highlighted comment: That’s something that we aim to keep at the forefront of our minds in our coverage of climate change, far beyond singular initiatives such as these. (While it’s great to see the suggestions we keep the blog going for longer, I don’t think Mikey Slezak would be very happy with me for committing to another 24-hour stint – as passionate as he is about rising seawaters.) Last year five islands in the Solomon islands were consumed by rising oceans. The impoverished Oceanic nation, home to 640,000 people, has seen annual sea levels rise by as much as 10mm in the last 20 years; Choiseul Province, home to 20,000 people, was forced to relocate its provincial hub. Fred Patison, the country manager for the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, says residents of Choiseul were attempting to strengthen their ecosystems to reinforce their natural safeguards against climate change. Speaking via Facebook messenger from his office in the capital Honiara, Patison says the Solomons have limited resources, so helping the local people preserve and care for their native forests, reefs and mangroves is the most straightforward action. “Ecosystem-based adaptation” is, for now, affordable and easily communicated – “although at some point relocation may become an option.” He adds that the Solomons were getting uncomfortably hot – a trend noted in other Pacific islands. According to Sydney Aquarium, today is penguin awareness day. As they point out, penguins are threatened by climate change as ice melts and sea level rises. And for your enjoyment, the Australian Antarctic Division have posted this adorable video of penguins being, well, penguins. (And soon we’ll be heading to Antarctica, hearing from a scientist working there right now.) Good morning from Sydney, Australia – my name is Elle Hunt and I’m helping Mikey Slezak co-pilot the blog in its final eight-hour stretch. In the past hour, we’ve learned about: the impact of rising sea levels in the low-lying Pacific island of Kiribati how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now (warning: this carbon countdown clock, updating in real time, may spike your anxiety) the latest on the toxic debate about renewable energy in Australia. The good news: voters aren’t convinced that it’s forcing prices up Coming up, we’ll head to Antarctica with Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division, who will be joining us for a real-time Q&amp;A from 11am AEDT. Watch his upcoming video interview and let us know what questions you have for him in the comments or on Twitter: I’m @mlle_elle, Mikey’s @MikeySlezak, and the hashtag we’re using is #GlobalWarning. Thanks for joining us. Here in Australia, there’s been a toxic debate about renewable energy. The fossil fuel industry, conservative media and the coalition government have been trying to link blackouts in South Australia, which have been caused by extreme weather, to the high proportion of renewables in that state. They’ve also been arguing that rising power bills around the country are a result of increases in renewable energy in the grid. But today, just as another extreme storm causes a large blackout in South Australia, we have polling from GetUp showing Australians have not been swayed by these arguments. Just over 17% of voters said they thought renewable energy was to blame for rising power prices. Read the full story here: This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. I’ve calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons (CO2-e). You can embed the clock on your own website as well by using the code from the embed button (that’s the purple one with as the symbol). First up, we’re starting in the low-lying island of Kiribati. My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy has filed this from New Zealand: Kiribati’s climate change officer Choi Yeeting says there are no climate deniers in his island home - because the population of 100,000 people in the central Pacific ocean see the devastating effects of climate change everyday, which in this low-lying atoll nation include rising sea-waters, extensive coastal erosion, increasing temperatures, prolonged droughts and severe fresh water shortages. “Technically speaking, we are planning ahead that one day we may have to leave our home,” said Yeeting. “But on the other side of that is a nationalist pride that comes with being an individual from Kiribati and not wanting to go down without a fight. People are trying to think positively and adapt, because leaving our home is the worst-case scenario.” Former President and renowned climate change activist Anote Tong says when there is a king tide and a moderate westerly wind blowing there is frequent damage to villages and homes, with crops destroyed and fresh water wells tainted. During his time in office (which ended last year), Tong became famous in the climate change community for taking strong, preventative action to prepare his country for the worst, including building sea walls, buying “fall-back” land in Fiji if Kiribati residents were one day forced to migrate, and investigating the feasibility of building a floating island. Tong is adamant that the initial purchase of the land in Fiji was an “investment decision” but since Kiribati’s fate has become more dire, Tong says the Fijian government and its people have stepped forward with open arms. “I have never been in support of our people being given the status of climate refugees. And the reason I say that is we have more than enough time to prepare. And I have always advocated a policy of migration with dignity.” he says. “But the Fiji government and the people have come forward to say Fiji would welcome people from Tuvalu, and Kiribati, if they should ever need a place to go to. And I think that is the moral response that I have been looking for from the international community. So that should be put on record for someone acting in a humanitarian, moral way to a challenge that is going to mean the destruction of homes, culture and people.” Before we move on – a quick update for new readers about what we’re doing here. Just ahead of a climate sceptic moving into the White House, we’re producing 24 hours of reporting on climate change happening now. We began with the blog being piloted from London, and had reporting from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The reins were then taken over by our colleagues in the US, who delivered reporting from the Americas. And here we are now in Australia, bringing you reporting from everywhere between India and Kiribati. It’s not all doom and gloom – we have reports about communities fighting climate change, about reasons to be hopeful and posts about what you can do to help limit global warming. Keep checking back in and let us know what you’re thinking on twitter or below the line. Hello from Sydney, Australia. From the office here, we’re going to drive the blog for the next nine hours, taking it through to the 24 hour mark. As the sun is now moving over the Asia Pacific, we’ll bing you reporting from Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Australia, China, Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia, India and lots of places in between. We’ll also turn to Antarctica, and give you the opportunity to fire questions to a climate scientist who is there now, in the middle of a major research project. You’ll hear from people living on the frontlines of climate change around the region, as well as people at the frontline of the fight against climate change. I’ll be asking some leaders of the climate movement if having a climate denier in the White House, and little progress on climate action in Australia, is a sign the movement is failing. I’ll bring you a video interview with a scientist working on the frontline of climate change in Antarctica – and give you an opportunity to ask him questions for yourself. But we want to hear from YOU. Let me know what’s happening with climate change around you, or how you might be preparing for it or fighting it. Tweet me @mikeyslezak or leave a comment below the line. We’ll try to feature as many of your inputs as we can. As Amanda Holpuch and Ashifa Kassam reported earlier, climate change will have cascading effects from forests in the American south-east to the far reaches of Canada. Brazil’s leading monitor of the Amazon told Jonathan Watts about the threat of cattle ranchers to the Amazon, and attorney Lauren Kurtz told Alan Yuhas about a campaign to help climate scientists protect themselves under the administration of Donald Trump. We’re also going to pass the baton to Michael Slezak and Elle Hunt in Sydney, Austraila, for the final sweep of climate change coverage around the world Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away More from Paulo Barret, head of Imazon, the world’s leading monitor of the Amazon rainforest. It has been argued that indigenous reserves have the best protected forest. Is that true from what you have observed? Indigenous lands and many Conservation Units (such as National Parks and National Forest) are the best protected areas. The indigenous peoples that are more protective are the ones that maintained their ancient livelihoods practices, which are dependent on healthy environment such as hunting, fishing and small scale agriculture. By being present in the areas, they also prevent timber extraction by loggers. Unfortunately, Congress wants to amend the constitution to make it harder to acknowledge land rights for indigenous people. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would review all demarcations of this type by Funai (The National Indian Foundation), which will further politicise the process. What more could be done in Brazil? INPE, the National Space Agency, uses satellite images to report the annual rate of deforestation and also to produce monthly alerts on hotspots of deforestation. Data from the latter – which is named DETER – is provided to the federal environmental agency to guide field inspections. Overall, the system works well, but in the past three years the government stopped publishing DETER’s data to the general public. The new Environment Minister has promised to resume monthly publication. The government should also resume the policies that had been effective including improving enforcement, implement and increase the area of Conservation Units. Additionally, government and private sector should work more on incentives for conservation, especially for small landholders. Finally, government should collect the land tax that would curb speculative deforestation and land grabbing. Looking 20 years into the future, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the Amazon? The best scenario would combine the implementation of policies that have been effective with new ones, such as incentives for conservation, with the aim of keeping the existing forest. But it is also necessary to invest in restoration given that Brazil has an estimated 28 million hectares of legal forest deficit in the whole country – about half of that in the Amazon. However, Brazil has promised to reforest only 12 million hectares up to 2030 as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. The worst scenario would be the continuation of weak government and a private sector that fails to understand the importance of forest conservation to sustainable development and fails to execute their stated commitment to zero deforestation. In that case, deforestation and forest fires would continue and we could lose 30% by 2050. That would take the forest to turning point, after which it could lose the capacity to regenerate due a combination of drier climate and frequent forest fires. Personally, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects for the Amazon? I am very concerned because of the financial and political crises in Brazil that are likely to last for several years. To offset this, the private sector and the international community should increase their support for forest conservation. For example, large corporations that committed to zero-deforestation should work closely with Brazilian authorities and landholders to curb deforestation. The Amazon contains half the world’s remaining rainforest, with an estimated 390bn trees doing the work of storing carbon and regulating the climate. Deforestation is removing those natural air filters. Early this century, an area the size of Albania was being cleared every year. Since then, the good news is that Brazil, which contains 60% of the Amazon, has taken action to slow deforestation. But pressures on the forest are growing again. I asked Paulo Barreto, the head of Imazon, the leading independent Amazon monitoring organisation, to give me an update on the situation. Your organisation uses satellite data to measure deforestation. What do the recent results tell us? The rate of deforestation decreased nearly 80% from 2005 to 2012. But from 2012 to 2016, deforestation rates increased 75% going from 4,571 to 7,989 square kilometres. Can you explain why progress has faltered? Deforestation rates increased because after 2012 Congress and the government weakened the environmental laws by pardoning some of the illegal deforestation, reduced Conservation Units, built large infrastructure project without proper environmental licensing procedures and decreased the enforcement of environmental law. An interactive map by Global Forest Watch tracks the change in forest cover since 2001. It is impressively grim. The pink (decline) areas are far more prominent than the blue (increase) areas. What does this mean for the climate? This means that the Amazon is a large contributor to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases when the forest is burned. In fact, deforestation is responsible for about half of the Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. Which areas have the most rapid deforestation ? Cattle ranching accounts for 65% of the deforested areas in the Amazon. Deforestation is facilitated by large infrastructure projects, which facilitated transport and attract immigration. In the past five years, this has happened near Belo Monte dam in Altamira and along the BR-163 highway in eastern Pará State and near Porto Velho, Rondônia State, where two dams have been built. On a more positive note, which areas are seeing reforestation ? Most reforestation has been by natural regeneration of forests in abandoned pasturelands. Usually, these lands are in areas with poor potential for land use intensification such as riparian areas or zones with high rainfall. Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to “save” coal mining, holding rallies where he mimed shoveling and accused Barack Obama of doing “everything he can to kill the coal industry”. Surrounded by advisers who oppose climate regulations, Trump will soon be able to hack through the rules put in place by Obama to curtail pollution. Saving coal, however, is likely out of beyond his powers. The free market, far more than regulations, has done the work of killing coal. Despite Trump’s insistence that the US is struggling for energy, the natural gas industry has created a supply glut so significant it has cut deeply into the economies of entire nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia among them. Coal couldn’t compete. Cheaper and cleaner than coal, though – not renewable or green – natural gas operations mushroomed all over the US over the last decade, so much so that they started creating earthquakes and short-lived boomtowns. Trump’s proposals would open up the US for even more gas exploration. Coal only accounts for about 30% of US electricity, down from about 50% in 2008, and its decline traces back several decades. The industry has lost about 200,000 jobs since 1980 as machines replaced humans in the mines, and as those mines delved into deeper, more expensive and dangerous mountains. Exports peaked in 2012, alongside the high points of growth in China, which has its own coal supplies and has now turned toward cleaner energy. Investment banks have also continued to back away from the industry as renewable technology has become cheaper. Clean energy is a hot topic for the political and business bigwigs who gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week. The forum has added more sessions on the subject (along with climate change) than ever before. That’s not surprising, given that solar and wind energy no longer represents mostly a badge of environmental activism. We are seeing an increasing number of companies, including Google, Apple and Ikea, that sign contracts to buy renewable electricity or even build their own solar and wind farms. That’s because the prices for these once-expensive sources of energy have dived since 2009, with 63% drop for solar contracts in the US over the past five years. Renewable energy investments, which also include geothermal and biomass, increased from $40.1bn in 2015 to $42.7bn in 2016 in the US, according to a new report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Solar being cheaper than coal? This was once unthinkable. Now, it’s already happening in some corners of the world and could spread to just about everywhere by 2025. Ashifa Kassam, the Guardian’s Canada correspondent this week sent us this dispatch from Lennox Island, off the coast of Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada. On Lennox, she wrote, the island has lost 400 acres in just a few generations and the First Nations community is wondering if it has a future. Kassam reports that over the past three decades, Danny Tuplin has watched the island’s shoreline inch closer to his two-storey house. Only a few years ago, his home sat 10ft from the water. Then in 2004, a hurricane-strength nor’easter blizzard brought the ocean to his doorstep.“I went out the back door, I took five steps and I was in salt water,” said the 58-year-old. Touching on similar issues, we have a comment piece by Julian Brave NoiseCat, an enrolled member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq’escen in British Columbia, who says the cornerstone of the climate justice movement must be indigenous rights and sovereignty. Earlier today we published this piece by Brave NoiesCat in which he writes: “Many believe the fight to combat climate change hinges on the aligned interests of capital and state. Give the Elon Musks of the world enough time and resources and they will innovate us out of impending climate catastrophe. Get the G20 in a room and they will hammer out a deal and create regulations to enforce it. Or so the thinking in some circles goes. Yet throughout history, the interests of the state have slid into alignment with big oil and big profits rather than lining up with our rivers, our air, our wildlife and our people. On Friday, men who disavow climate change and profit mightily from fossil fuels will take charge. In a global race to the bottom, there’s no telling how far downriver these shortsighted profiteers will sell our future generations. Elsewhere on our Comment site today, commissioned for our climate blog, we have a piece by Osprey Orielle Lake, who is marching against Trump on Saturday and argues there is a link between violence against women and the Earth. At the largest gathering of earth scientists in the world last month, a few lawyers had set up a booth stacked with small books for any researcher who would take it: legal advice for how to protect yourself from political persecution. “We’re worried about a lot of things,” said Lauren Kurtz, executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, adding that some scientists had received legal and even death threats. “We have people in power who’ve used legal bullying in the past,” she added, alluding to Trump’s history of using expensive lawsuits, or at least the threat of them, to attempt to silence critics. “That sort of legal bullying is going to be seen as much easier to do.” A handful of scientists have already been targeted for their week. Dr Michael Mann, currently a professor at Penn State, was sucked into a long-running legal suit when a rightwing activist group sued the University of Virginia, his former employer, to access tens of thousands of his emails. Scientists at the University of Arizona are currently enmeshed in a similar fight, and last year representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, tried to subpoena scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Their argument is basically if you get the emails you’ll get the full meat of research, whereas it’s actually a way for them to take words out of context.” Barack Obama’s White House defended the climate scientists’ research; scientists now fear that the Trump administration will leave them at the mercy of lawmakers and activists with an interest in silencing scientists. In 2014 a court decided in Mann’s favor, agreeing with him that turning over research emails chilled research; discouraged collaboration; and put scientists at a competitive disadvantage. The Arizona case remains unresolved after a victory by a group funded by several energy companies. Scientists have also come to the legal group with fears for their professional future. They could be barred from grants or lose funding and effectively iced out of their own jobs, Kurtz said. “We worry about government suppression, where scientists can’t do the same research, can’t use the words climate change, modify reports to make it seem like it’s not as drastic as it is.” In turn, she said, the team of attorneys has started to research whistleblower cases, “if and when a scientist comes to us for those sorts of quandaries. A couple have stopped by to say, ‘Hey, I am employed by DOE another one by USGS. I was going to retire and now I’m not going to, because I feel like there’s a need for me to be on the front lines and fight back.’” Much of the data from federal agencies is already public, and some scientists have already begun “guerrilla archiving” to back up the climate data on non-government servers. “Who knows what will happen with the Trump administration,” Kurtz said. “They may do all sorts of back-door things. I don’t think the Trump administration is going to be super pro transparency.” After Donald Trump was elected in November, the mayors of more than 60 US cities sent an open letter to the president-elect urging him to work with them on combating climate change. Trump’s team has yet to respond to the letter, said Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of the Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda. Garcetti, who is in DC for the US Conference of mayors, said he is encouraged by the conversations he’s had this week. “Even a change of administration cannot take away our determination and our ability to continue our progress,” Garcetti said. “Through different administrations and different congresses, most of the action has happened at the local level.” Garcetti said he spoke to the president-elect from the C40 Climate Summit in Mexico City last month. Though he wouldn’t elaborate on details of the conversation, Garcetti described Trump as “open-minded” on the call. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he’s hopeful the Trump administration will respond to the economic case for fighting climate change. “This issue goes a lot deeper than Democrats and Republicans,” Walsh said. “This goes into healthcare. … These issues all of sudden are starting to become economic issues.” Extreme storms, wildfires and droughts, sea level rising and storm surges and air pollution are not just concerns for the mayors of big, liberal cities, Garcetti and Walsh stressed. Climate change is “not an ideological issue but an urgent one for us, that transcends partisanship with undeniable science and more importantly undeniable human impacts”. As climate change causes parts of the earth to grow hotter and drier, it has also led to a recent surge in extremely destructive wildfires. It is difficult to link specific events, like the devastating wildfires in Tennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains last year, directly to climate change, but scientists found that a drier and warmer planet can increase the likelihood of wildfires. “If you get conditions that are ripe for a wildfire across multiple places and at multiple times then wildfires will actually happen,” said Auroop Ganguly, an expert on climate extremes and water sustainability in Northeastern University’s department of civil and environmental engineering. But even as regions become more susceptible to wildfires, there still has to be a trigger, like arson, to start the blaze. Ganguly compared this to a person’s general health: if someone’s all-around health is bad, he explained, that person is more susceptible to other illnesses. That person will also have a more difficult time fighting back against a sickness. Similarly, hotter and drier parts of the globe are more susceptible to wildfires and have a more difficult time responding to it. And scientists say the planet could become more vulnerable to wildfires. Fire season was longer for more than a quarter of the Earth’s surface from 1973 to 2013, according to a July 2015 study published in Nature. The study also found that climatic changes are expected to increase fire season severity in the coming decades. So far, Donald Trump has said extremely little about how he would lead Nasa, whose administrator reports directly to the president, or the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, whose officials report to the secretary of commerce. Late in the campaign, Trump said he hoped to “free Nasa” from its logistics work in low-Earth orbit (which Nasa does little of) and instead “refocus its mission on space exploration”. “Did you ever see what’s going on with space, with Russia and different places? And us? We’re, like, we’re like watching. Isn’t that nice? So much is learned from that, too.” The main suggestion of Trump’s speech, alongside his repeated denial and skepticism toward the science of global warming, is that he intends to cut Nasa’s Earth science work. Bob Walker, an adviser to the president-elect, has pushed the idea of cutting all of Nasa’s climate research in favor of deep space exploration. Climate scientists have warned this would prove a savage blow to research efforts. Trump’s nominee for secretary of commerce is billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who has not commented at all about how he would lead Noaa, protect US fisheries or guide climate science. Ross made his fortune, in part, by rehabilitating steel and coal companies. Trump has not said who he would name Noaa’s administrator; Obama’s first pick for the post was marine ecologist Jane Lubchenco. The current administrator of Nasa, former astronaut Charles Bolden, is expected to follow tradition for appointees when a new president takes the White House, and submit his resignation shortly after Trump is inaugurated. Though Nasa has generally enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, it has a $2bn Earth science program that many scientists fear will suffer greatly under a Republican government stocked with many climate change skeptics and deniers. The space agency’s planetary science programs may go untouched, but scientists also fear that funding will stagnate as Congress enacts new tax cuts and grapples with how to reconcile those with hugely expensive efforts to repeal healthcare reform and spend on infrastructure. Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa’s new associate administrator told reporters last month that he stands by the priorities and data he prepared for the incoming administration. “The principles we drew out are the principles that we would use in any administration,” he said, adding that he urged scientists to “focus on the data that we get and not amplify the noise.” “Behave like scientists, and talk like scientists, passionately,” he continued. “Talk about science in away we know that’s affecting life on earth.” As Ucilia Wang and Jonathan Watts reported earlier, climate change will affect just about every detail of daiy life, from your morning coffee to chocolate to a glass of wine. Later on we’ll hear how this increasing aridity is going to affect your meal – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. We’re also going to hear about the steps climate scientists can take to defend themselves in the age of Trump Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Renewable energy has long been considered a liberal cause championed by tree huggers on the ground and Democrats in governments. That political divide showed up in election campaign contributions historically as well. But during the 2016 election cycle, the solar and wind trade groups gave more money to Republicans than Democrats running for federal offices for the first time, reported Reuters. Their bets may pay off as they face a new administration with a new president who thinks solar and wind are expensive and sees wind turbines as bird killers that also ruin views of his golf courses. Roughly $400,000 from wind and solar political action committees (Pac) went to dozens of federal election candidates. Among the Republicans are Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Representative Tom Reed of New York and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who together received more than 40% of the federal campaign contributions from the Solar Energy Industries Association Pac. That shift in money politics reflects the reality that many red states are home to large solar and wind farms. Take a look at the top 10 states with the most solar energy generation and you will find Arizona, North Carolina and Texas on the list. The top wind energy states include Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa. Lobbying across political lines also makes sense because the country’s energy market is made up of more than 3,000 utilities and regulated mostly by states. Local politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, are particularly keen to support businesses that bring jobs and tax revenues. Encroaching into homes and dinner tables, rich and poor alike, climate change plays no favorites – it will take your chocolate. Cacao trees grow in rainforest climates that will only become drier in the next few decades, depriving the plants of the large amounts of water they need to grow. Research collated by Noaa and the IPCC suggests that climate change will force the best land for growing chocolate into higher altitudes, creating a slew of conflicts for farmers and industries, especially in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, where a huge amount of the world’s cacao is grown. Over the last 40 years, the world’s available land for cocoa growth has declined 40%; the temperature in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire is expected to rise two degrees Celsius over the next 40. Growers in some regions are trying to breed drought-resistant plants to survive the worsening conditions, while others are replanting sections of rainforest to mimic cacao’s natural habitats, in a method called cabruca in Brazil. Coffee will fare even worse than cacao, suffering from the increasing heat as well as the aridity, and beer production, reliant on a large amount of water for processing hops, has already been affected at dozens of breweries. Climate change has already encroached into grocery stores and restaurant menus, as it kills crops and makes it harder to keep fruit, vegetables and livestock alive. Global warming is also draining our drinks, including one of the oldest human libations: wine. A warming climate will affect the quality and yield of the grapes, with mixed results around the world. Rising temperatures could help growers in some regions, for instance helping France in particular grow premium grapes. But the same can’t be said for California, the biggest wine producing state in the country. Rising temperatures, coupled with persistent drought and the likelihood of more extreme hot and wet days ahead, are gradually making the state less habitable for its notable varietals, including chardonnay and cabernet. Grape growers have been taking note of the effect of global warming. How they deal with it will influence the role the US is the global wine industry, where the country is among the top five wine grape growing and wine-producing nations. Some vintners are using technology to help them cope. For example, they are using sensors and drones to monitor soil quality and planting more cover crops to retain moisture in the ground. They are turning to owls and falcons to fight the growing army of pests such as mice and voles. They are also recycling the precious water more, in some cases relying on giant bins of earthworms to do the job. In London, the live panel debate is underway off at Guardian headquarters. A room full of members, readers and activists joins host Mark Rice-Oxley, the actor and entrepreneur, Lily Cole, the author and academic, Dr Jonathan Rowson, and the Green party’s science and technology spokesperson, Esther Obiri-Darko. Also on the panel are the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, Craig Bennett and the “renegade economist” Kate Raworth. Opening the debate, the panel members discussed how to be about the political and economic change necessary to protect the environment. Cole told the audience that the most effective option for individuals was to vote with their wallets. One of the main areas I’ve focused on is how I spend my money. I’m not perfect with it, I’m as guilty as most westerners of buying too much... But, because the world is so driven by economics and so driven by money right now, the only way you’re going to communicate to businesses is by starving their bottom line. Obiri-Darko added that such a change needed a combination of “people power” and government accountability; saying that one or the other alone would not bring it about. She said that, where she knocks on doors in south west London, air pollution was a major concern and only when climate change began to affect people would they start to demand action from their elected officials. Raworth cited Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign as an example of what she characterised as an obsession with growth at the expense of other issues, such as the protection of the environment. Rowson agreed that Trump has an “old-fashioned economic mindset” and his election was unlikely to be helpful to those who sought to fight climate change. But he said, looking at the bigger picture, the election of a US president - possibly only for four years - should not been seen as a catastrophic event, adding that Trump can be influenced because of the extent to which he cares about his esteem. Bennett agreed that there was cause for optimism, arguing that movements have never brought about major societal changes unopposed. It was only when the campaigns to abolish slavery were doing really well that the pro-slavery movement formed. They said ‘this will harm my competitiveness, we can’t possibly afford this, it’s going to cost jobs’. Almost identical arguments to those used now by people campaigning against action on climate change. The cup of coffee that millions of us woke up with this morning was more likely to have come from Brazil than another nation. But this ritual will become rarer and more expensive, according to forecasts that climate change will cut the bean-growing belt by half here and across the world over the next 35 years. Drought and rising average temperatures are already a growing worry for farmers such as Maria Assunção da Silva, whose family has grown coffee in Minas Gerais since the 19th century. The business has rarely been tougher than in the past four years. In 2013, the drought was so severe the beans formed as empty husks. Since then, he says, the weather has been destructively unpredictable. It has been dry in the usual rainy season, which results in smaller beans. In the usual dry season, it rains, which makes it difficult to process the harvest. “What we have been seeing in these past years has been hindering our production,” Silva says. Others have fared worse. In Espirito Santo recently, the worst drought in 80 years forced farmers to dig up thousands of arid robusta coffee trees and switch to alternative crops. Warehouses in the region were down to a quarter of their capacity. Exports of conilon, a variety of robusta, fell 90%. With prospects poor for this year, many warehouses are expected to close. Growers say the weather is becoming more erratic and extreme. São Paulo’s coffee producers suffered dire water shortages in 2015, but when the rains finally came, it was often in intense downpours that led to flood damage. While the main temperature trend is of warming, some crops were hit by frost in freakish cold spells last winter - in the middle of the hottest year ever recorded in the world. “What is certain is that the weather is more unstable and unpredictable,” noted agronomy engineer and coffee farmer, Pedro Ronca. Overall, improved production techniques and well-timed rains for the main arabica crop ensured a good national harvest and a stabilisation of prices. But scientists and environmental groups warn the situation will become more difficult in the years ahead in Brazil and other coffee-producing nations. “Increasing temperatures and extreme weather events will cut the area (in the world) suitable for production by up to 50%, erode coffee quality, and increase coffee prices for consumers,” predicted a Climate Institute study last year. Earlier research by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, suggested none of the current coffee producing regions in Brazil would have the ideal conditions (average temperatures of 18-22C, ample rain and no frost) by 2080. “Once full climate change effects are experienced, Brazil may face challenges to remain a major coffee producing country,” the authors noted. This grim scenario is far from inevitable. As well as global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change, Brazilian officials, scientists and farmers are moving to adapt. Eduardo Assad, of the government’s agriculture research institute Embrapa, believes there is considerable potential to move coffee production to the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. Currently that is not feasible due to frost, but this risk will decline if temperatures rise by 2C. Even so, this would require huge disruption to Brazil’s agriculture, particularly to coffee farmers who usually require 15 to 20 years for a return on their investment. For now, most would rather stay put and use technology and chemicals to cope with rising climate challenges. Silva is investing in a coffee drier because he cannot depend on the sun, more anti-fungicide chemicals because the risks from unseasonal rain have increased, and to counter the rising temperatures he is planting new heat-resistant varieties of coffee and insulating the soil with straw. “We don’t think the weather conditions will improve, so we are trying to adapt to the new climate variation,” he says. Such measures push up his costs and the global value of beans, but, if the forecasts are correct, it is only the start of the rise in price that we will all pay for our morning cup of coffee As Jonathan Watts reported earlier, the end of the world is looking not just warm but dry, from the mountainous lakes of South America up to the disappearing snowpacks of California. Later on we’ll hear how this increasing aridity is going to affect your meal: – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. We’re also going to hear about Nasa’s future under Trump and the growing range of wildfires Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Michael Ingui, an architect at Baxt Ingui Architects, specializes in creating passive houses – “super-insulated houses that use a fraction of the energy” of a traditional home. Passive houses use much less energy than a traditional home due to a by using superior insulation, special triple-glazed windows and an energy recovery ventilator which filters in fresh air and releases stale air. The ventilator is used to heat the house, which means no radiators and no boiler. It also means significantly less energy costs: Ingui estimates his passive houses save “80-90%” on energy bills. “The way I would really describe it is: a passive house is just a better building,” Ingui said. “It can also heat and cool itself passively, without any mechanical elements.” The walls of a passive house are much thickerthan a normal home due to the extra insulation, which Ingui described as forming an “envelope” in which any gaps that may exist in a traditional home are completely sealed. Ingui has designed and fitted out seven in the past four years, and is working on three more. Some of those homes – including the one I looked around in Brooklyn on Thursday – have solar panels on the roof, which means they can effectively be carbon zero. … We have a small favour to ask.

What happens in Antarctica does not stay there: the icy waters off the southernmost continent are an engine for life around the world, and they are warming faster than anywhere else – a threat to the global food supply. For decades, scientists have been diving underneath the quickly melting ice in a race to learn the consequences of warming on the ecosystem. For six years of increasingly withering heat, Californians have rationed resources, fought with celebrities and watched as precious reservoirs and snowpacks, so important to the state’s economy and daily lives of its residents, disappeared to historic lows. When it rained, it was never enough – though hope has partially returned with massive storms of the last three weeks. According to the US Drought Monitor, about 42% of the state is out of drought, thanks to a series of heavy rains around the Bay area and blizzards over part of the Sierra Nevada, where snowpack provides critical water for the state in the spring and summer. The heavy rains also replenished the state’s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta, back to 82%, and even Los Angeles saw flash flood warnings as storms stretched across the state. But southern California has not enjoyed as much of a deluge as the north. Santa Barbara’s Lake Cachuma holds only about 8% of its capacity. New Melones Lake, in central California, holds only about 60% of its historical average, and some residents in the region need bottled water to drink and cook. Jay Lund, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California Davis, warned that the drought will leave scars that may last decades. The state may have to keep paying for expensive water pumping for years, and in the Central Valley some aquifers “might never recover to pre-drought levels”, he wrote in a blog post. “Drought damage to California’s forests could require decades to recover, or, if higher temperatures persist, the ecology of many forests might shift to new normal condition,” he added. “Native fish also will likely need years to recover – with impediments from already depleted numbers and highly disrupted and altered ecosystems.” Lund said that the state’s leaders need to accept that the drought is not permanent, but that California is “a dry place with permanent water shortages (except in unusual wet years)”. Over on Tumblr, we’ve been running a blog collecting young people’s experiences, hopes and fears on climate change. You can submit your own messages or artwork here. We’ll be highlighting some of the posts throughout the day. The end of the world is dry. That is not a prophesy of doom, but an increasingly evident fact as I learned during a recent trip to Patagonia. I visited in October, revelling in the immensity of the region (which is four times the area of the United Kingdom), zagging back and forth between its Chilean and Argentinian sides, delighting in spectacular mountain and grassland scenery, and taking a dark pleasure in the road signs telling me I was on the “Ruta del Fin del Mundo”, a geographic reference to this southernmost tip of the Americas rather than a reminder of imminent apocalypse. I also spent a lot of time skimming stones across lakes - a childhood pastime given a fresh boost by the incredible scenery, the glasslike surface of tarns in the Torres del Paine, warm weather and the discovery of a slow-mo feature on my cellphone video camera. Much as I enjoyed this activity, it also reminded me of the damage being done by rising temperatures and declining rainfall. Lakes formed by glacier melt were full. Many others had dried up completely, destroying fish habitats and drinking sources for jaguars, guanacos and ema. This wasn’t restricted to Torres del Paine. Five hundred miles further further south, I saw pink flamingos flapping their way across a half empty body of water and, then, another 15 minutes along the road, a fox crossing through the dust of a white alkaline lake bed that had been completely exposed to the wind. Over the course of the weeklong trip, I lost count of the lakes that had evaporated. After I returned home, I did a little research on whether this was merely seasonal or a sign of a longer-term climactic shift. Climate scientists believe the world’s extremities, the poles and mountains ranges, are warming faster than elsewhere, which means Patagonia is particularly vulnerable because both its latitude and altitude are high. Shin Sugiyama, a researcher at the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University, confirmed the region’s glaciers were declining faster than those in other mountain ranges. Andrés Rivera, a Senior Researcher of the Glaciology Laboratory at the Centre for Scientific Studies in Valdivia in Chile, noted how the recent dry period in the region has contributed to rising snow-lines and a loss of lake volumes. Eric Rignot, professor of Earth System Science at the University of California, said the glacier melt and lack of precipitation were likely to have been affected by the ebbing of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), a belt of Antarctic low pressure that normally brings snow and ice to Patagonia. Research from other scientists say SAM is at its weakest ebb in 1,000 years, due in part to to increasing greenhouse gas levels. The consequences are not sudden. Rather they are of steadily increasing severity. Chilean newspapers have reported the worst drought in Patagonia since records began, after seven consecutive years of unusually low snowfall, short winters and hot summers. In Argentina, this is blamed for the deaths of 1.8m sheep, or 12% of the national flock. The earlier stage of this prolonged drought has also left a black mark on the landscape in the form of thousands of charred stumps from the huge forest fire that tore through Torres del Paine In 2011. That was started by careless tourists and spread out of control because trees and brush were unusually dry. Despite it all, Patagonia is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. I would certainly love to go back, explore remote glaciers, marvel at the other worldly skyscapes and, of course, skim more stones. How many lakes, though, will be left? As Lauren Gambino reported earlier, mayors in US cities are making plans to fight climate change themselves if they have to. Later on we’ll also hear how the financial rewards – the money that can be made in renewables – also holds out hope for the future even if our political leaders fail us. We’re also going to hear about how drought is impacting California and Latin America. Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away New York City and the wider state are embracing renewable energy as the state’s leaders take steps to resist Donald Trump’s rollback of green initiatives. The Atelier Condo, a 47-story, 478-unit residential building in Hell’s Kitchen, for instance, installed about 3,000-square-feet of solar panelling in 2011. Daniel Neiditch, president of the Atelier and of real estate company River 2 River Realty, said that after rebates from the city and state, the investment cost $70,000. Nieditch said he earned that much back in savings after a year-and-a-half. He estimates currently provide almost 10% of the building’s energy. “There’s no way you can do solar and not save money over time,” Neiditch said. “It’s a no brainer.” New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 80% by 2050 and both local and state incentives can cut the cost of solar panel installation by 50%. Neiditch said some developers don’t realise how quickly they will make their money back, or what kind of rebates are available in their state. “There’s so much more that can be done,” Neiditch said. He said developers “need to be educated” on the benefits – possibly by the city or state. The Atelier will be fitted with another 6,000 sq-ft of solar panels this summer, Neiditch said, which could mean solar accounts for 25% of the buildings electricity, saving $200,000 a year. This morning the Guardian caught up with a couple of big city mayors to discuss their concerns about the incoming administration’s climate change agenda. The takeaway: who needs Washington? Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Boston mayor Marty Walsh said the real change is happening at the local level and federal action, er inaction, won’t change that. “Don’t get in our way,” Garcetti said, describing his message to an administration that is hostile to efforts to curb climate change at the federal level. Trump has threatened to pull out of the international Paris agreement and said he would dismantle Obama’s Clean Power Plan, as well as other initiatives taken by the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has nominated Kansas attorney general Scott Pruitt to head up the EPA, the agency he is currently suing. “We’re prepared, if we withdraw from Paris, to enact Paris at the local level,” Garcetti told a handful of journalists at the Hilton Continental Hotel in Washington. “Worst-case scenario, the federal government can probably take away 20% or 30% of our progress, and I’d rather have 100% than 70% or 80%, but I feel like that 70 to 80% of further progress is inevitable based on the leadership that we’ve already shown.” Much of the international fretting over the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the US presidency is focused on the real estate magnate’s pledge to “cancel” the Paris climate deal. Tearing up a central plank of Barack Obama’s climate legacy by removing America from the agreement would cause shockwaves that could badly damage the global climate effort. But will that actually happen? Currently, every functioning government in the world is signed up the Paris goal of limiting global warming to a 2C increase on pre-industrial times. Chinese president Xi Jingping, in a veiled jab at Trump this week, warned that “we must ensure this endeavor is not derailed.” Similar diplomatic pressure is likely to come from other nations once Trump is in the White House. Quitting the Paris accord would take a three-year notice period. A quicker way would be to exit the UN climate body itself, which would take just a year. Such a move would likely cause other countries to question why they should make the effort to cut emissions if the US, historically the world’s largest emitter, can’t be bothered. The latter option appears unlikely, for now at least. Shortly after his election win, Trump said that he in fact has an “open mind” to the Paris deal. And then Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, played down the prospect of complete US withdrawal last week: I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. Perhaps the most likely outcome is ostensible US involvement in the UN climate process but with little effort to provide the climate funding or emissions reduction goals demanded by the Paris deal. Whether the Trump administration will be openly disruptive or sullen during talks remains to be seen. “It isn’t clear whether his ‘seat at the table’ will be a good dinner guest or the drunk uncle,” said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. In partnership with the Guardian, Univision Noticias is highlighting the urgency of climate action around the world. Join Univision and Fusion environmental correspondent Nicolás Ibargüen as he discusses on Facebook Live. We’ve heard from Jonathan Watts how experts in Brazil are anxious at the indigenous territories and fears there around a government move to change how their land is demarcated. We’ll have more on this theme later. 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Shortly we’ll have live video from our partners Univision in Miami. Before that, its worth reflecting that Trump has a home in Florida which he regularly spends time at. Mar-a-Lago mansion began as a cereal heiress’ dream of a presidential retreat on a south Florida beach. The children of its current occupant, President-elect Donald Trump, may live to see the ocean sweep over the tennis courts, up across the long, and up to the mansion’s front door. Whether the next president accepts science or not, climate change is on course to turn his beloved resort into something closer to Atlantis than the winter White House. By 2045, a relatively weak category-two hurricane would bring the ocean up to main building of the resort, a risk consulting firm found last year. Two other Trump properties, in Hollywood and Sunny Isles, could be cut off from roads and even made temporary islands by tidal floods. Just over an hour the south, Miami is already at war with the ocean, as tides floods increasingly sweep floods into the streets and homes, swamping condo lobbies and cutting off islands and bridges. The rate of sea-level rise has tripled over the last 10 years, according to a University of Miami study. City leaders have budgeted $400m to install dozens of water pumps around the city and to raise the height of roads and seawalls, but the state remains divided: real estate developers continue to build expensive condos, and the governor insists on skepticism toward science. The tides, meanwhile, continue to seep up through Florida’s porous limestone ground, threatening to destroy homes and seeping sewage into drinking water. By some researchers’ predictions, parts of south Florida appear already lost, and swaths of the state will be underwater by 2025. 2016 was the warmest year, globally, on record and the second warmest year on record in the US, following the long-term warming trend. As Trump assumes the presidency, there are signs that these numbers are starting to translate into tangible consequences for Americans: There are now Americans displaced due to climate change, from Louisiana to Alaska. Several Alaskan towns are set to be relocated – last year warmer than normal days outnumbered cooler than normal days in the state by a ratio of nine to one. Of the 10 global cities deemed by the World Bank at most risk from sea level rise, five are in the US – New York, Boston, New Orleans, Tampa and Miami. The north-east of the US is warming faster than the global average and the sea level is rising more quickly too. New research, published in Nature, shows that crop harvests in the US are likely to shrink by as much as a half due to rising temperatures. States such as California, already stricken by drought, are likely to face huge “megadroughts” in the future. Last year there were 15 climate-related disasters in the US that cost more than $1bn in damages. A total of 138 lives were lost. The severity of hurricanes and floods is likely to increase in parts of the US. There has been a four-fold increase in the number of large, lengthy forest fires in the American west over the past 30 years. While Trump may be unconcerned over the impact of climate change, the period of his presidency is likely to involve further signs that Americans are at risk. In response, Trump has so far promised to gut climate and clean energy spending, withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal and attempt to kickstart the ailing coal industry. Public realization of scientists’ warnings has been illustrated by the latest polling by Yale University. In November, Yale found that one in five Americans are “very worried” about climate change – the highest proportion yet recorded. 4) Where are the public on this issue? Is there is an ideological dividing line as in the US, or is there a broad consensus about the science? In 2015, 28% of Brazilian municipalities entered into emergency or calamity due to extreme weather – droughts, floods, storms, landslides. This affected millions of people so that are aware things are changing. We don’t face the same debate as the US about whether climate change is related to human activities. Last year, the Paris climate treaty was ratified easily despite our political crisis. Even the most conservative members on the political spectrum, the debate is more about what we do about climate change. Some say Brazil has already made the biggest contribution through deforestation reduction and renewables, which account for a little more than 70% of electricity generation and 40% of the total energy mix. The question is whether to do more. But unfortunately, climate change is not a priority for this government, as it wasn’t for the previous one. It is seen as an environmental issue, not a development issue. 5) What does this mean in concrete terms? The past two years have seen a 60% rise in deforestation. Considering what is going on now in congress, we could see a new era of deforestation in Brazil. It is very alarming. We could be returning to the bad days of more than 10,000 square km of clearance each year. 6) How might climate policy be affected by the 2018 presidential election? I don’t think Brazil can elect someone like Trump who denies climate change, but we could have someone with very conservative ideas who sees the environment as an obstacle for development. They might argue that if US is doing nothing on climate, why should we? But one of the candidates will be former environment minister Marina Silva, who will ensure that sustainable development and climate policy are part of the debate. It’s too early though to say who might win. We don’t know who will run and what will be the impact of the ongoing corruption investigation (intro bribery at the state oil firm Petrobras). But the result will be important. The next president is the one who will have to deliver results because after 2020 Brazil’s commitments become obligations. 7) Given the current trends, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future? I’m not too gloomy, but Brazil is a country of lost opportunities. Every year, there are more groups who see forests and the environment as obstacles to development. But there are good signs too. There is room in the private sector for discussing climate change as an opportunity for Brazil to benefit from our natural capital. We need a more efficient agriculture and more renewable energy – biofuels, bio energy, wind, solar and hydro. Why not make the most of these competitive advantages? The economic benefits of climate action are huge. We are trying to make this a priority for the next president. But it won’t be easy. If the world is to get emissions under control, Brazil will be a key player. Over the past decade, it has played a mostly positive role, both in taking domestic action to reduce the rate of deforestation of the Amazon, and also in constructive diplomacy in international climate talks. But economic recession and political turmoil have led many to fear this might change in the future. For an insight into what might come next, I approached Carlos Rittl, associate researcher of the Brazilian Climate Observator, an umbrella organisation that represents more than 40 environment NGOs. Here’s our Q&amp;A: 1) Yesterday, the Brazilian justice ministry changed the rules for demarcating indigenous land. What is your take on this? This is really, really bad. It is the most negative change made in environmental and climate policy since the government of (Michel) Temer took power last year. Indigenous territories are critical for Brazil’s climate resilience. This new move threatens even already demarcated lands, yet the justice ministry moved ahead without any public debate, any discussion with the people affected. It shows what a myopic view the new government has when it comes to land use. 2) How else has climate policy changed since the switch of government from the centre-left administration of Dilma Rousseff to the centre-right administration of Michel Temer? In terms of Brazil’s goals, there has been no change. But there has been a shift in attitude that could affect whether those targets are achieved. There are many proposals that are bad for the climate. The administration wants to soften environmental legislation and reduce protected areas. Before Temer came to power, he outlined his approach in a document called Bridge to the Future. It contained no reference to climate or renewables. The only reference to the environment was a promise to weaken the environmental licensing process. 3) One of the reasons for the political shift has been the rise of the agribusiness and evangelical lobbies in congress. What are their goals when it comes to climate policy? There is a danger that Brazil’s climate policy could shift backwards. Agribusiness presents itself as the solution to current economic crisis. They say they need more investment and more support and changes to land policy. The decision made by the ministry of justice yesterday is connected to that. They also want to prevent agribusinesses from having to do annual environmental licensing renewals. They want approval for mining in indigenous territories and protected areas. They are also pushing for more infrastructure to make their business easier. For example on the Tapajos river, they don’t just want more dams, but also waterways so soy can be shipped from central Brazil to Europe. All this will make it more difficult for Brazil to deliver on its 2020 climate goals. They are also trying to remove the environment minister from his post because he is trying to do his job. Over the next few hours we’ll also be hearing from our Latin American correspondent, Jonathan Watts. First up he’s been speaking to a key expert in Brazil, a key country. Later we’ll hear about his trip to Patagonia, and how climate change is affecting something a lot of people hold dear: coffee. Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is the outgoing chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant under investigation for possibly defrauding investors about what it knew and did about climate change. Shortly after Barack Obama’s election in 2009, Tillerson announced his support for a carbon tax – if only because he considers it preferable to cap and trade policies – but environmental groups have denounced Tillerson’s nomination. Tillerson does not deny that climate change is real, but in a hearing with Congress last week refused to answer a question about whether ExxonMobil had tried to sow doubt about the science. Tillerson told Senator Tim Kaine, “I’m in no position to speak” for his company’s executives, until the frustrated congressman asked, “Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or are you refusing to do so?” “A little of both,” Tillerson answered. Tillerson also rejected the Pentagon’s warning that climate change is a national security risk and would only say the US will “keep a seat at the table” in the international effort to curb global warming. Trump has previously promised to quit the Paris climate deal. As we’ve pointed out in the previous post, Obama’s legacy is far from perfect. But it’s fair to say there are greater fears around the Trump administration’s key cabinet posts relating to climate change. Alan Yuhas is about to post on the pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Also ahead we’ll have more video from New York’s rooftops. Highlights: 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Barack Obama has banned drilling in the Arctic, fought to reduce pollution and power plant emissions, and preserved more marine territory than any previous president. Yet researchers at Columbia University say that his legacy is tarnished by the work of the US Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that has handed out nearly $34bn of taxpayer-funded loans to corporations and foreign governments for fossil-fuel projects. The team at Columbia collaborated with the Guardian last year on a report that showed how Obama’s the obscure agency within his own administration quietly spoiled his record by helping fund a steady outpouring of new overseas fossil fuel emissions – effectively erasing gains expected from his headline clean power plan or fuel efficiency standards. Since January 2009, the US Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad. Here’s a video we made about Obama’s climate change legacy. As Rick Perry’s rather polite confirmation hearing rolls on, it’s worth recalling the more combative hearing faced by Scott Pruitt yesterday. Pruitt is Trump’s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA was founded by a Republican administration with a mission to keep America’s water clean, its air free of toxic pollution, and help towns around the country keep their fields, roads and rivers safe. Pruitt has used his post as Oklahoma’s attorney general to sue the EPA 14 times in seven years, 13 in alliances with energy, agriculture and other large corporations. Pruitt, 48, is the first pick for EPA administrator opposed by the Environmental Defense Fund since Richard Nixon founded the federal agency in 1970, and has received more than $300,000 in campaign donations from executives at poultry and oil corporations. Other environmental groups have called Pruitt a “puppet” of oil and gas companies, noting that in 2014 he fought regulations with a letter written by Devon Energy. In another case unearthed by the New York Times, Pruitt stopped a legal fight between towns and poultry companies whose tons of chicken manure were poisoning water in north-eastern Oklahoma. If confirmed, Pruitt will likely try to dismantle Barack Obama’s work on climate change, with the Clean Power Plan his most obvious target. The plan is currently on hold in the courts, due to a suit brought by 27 Republican-led states to stop it. Pruitt has also doubted the evidence of climate change in general, claiming in May that – although 2016 proved to break yet more records for temperature and sea ice, and that nearly all scientists agree the world is warming dangerously – the “debate is far from settled”. In his home state of Oklahoma, where Pruitt has fought to keep hydraulic fracking as unregulated as possible, scientists have linked fracking to an extraordinary increase in earthquakes. Oklahomans are now as likely to feel an earthquake as Californians. One of the themes we are looking at is how the impact of climate change does not affect everyone equally. On Comment, we’ve just launched a piece from Elizabeth C Yeampierre, the executive director of Uprose, an organization that fights for environmental justice. She writes: “When things are bad for everyone, they are particularly bad for people of color. The Trump administration is about to legitimize injustice in all of our communities. People of color have endured the extraction of our land and labor – and its legacy – since the creation of these United States. Now, we are bracing ourselves for worse things to come.” Read the full comment piece here Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is currently facing questions from US senators in his confirmation hearing as Donald Trump’s secretary of energy. Perry rather sheepishly told the senators that he regrets calling for the department of energy to be scrapped. Famously, Perry ran for president in 2012 only to call for the abolition of three government departments in a televised debate. The problem was he couldn’t remember the name of the third agency – energy – leading him to flounder briefly and then mutter “oops”. Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator on the energy committee, couldn’t resist: “I suspect now, having a chance to learn about the importance of this department, you have a very different opinion.” Perry conceded he may have been a little hasty. “After being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination,” he told the committee. The Department of Energy maintains America’s nuclear arsenal, cleans up nuclear waste and undertakes research in a number of areas, including climate change. The Trump transition team raised alarm by sending out a questionnaire that asked for names of scientists who have worked on climate research. Perry said he didn’t approve of the request and promised the committee that he wouldn’t target climate scientists or eviscerate their work. Perry did confirm, however, he supports Trump’s “America first” energy strategy (which means lots of drilling for oil and gas) and it doesn’t sound like he will be bending the president’s ear over the urgency of global warming. He told the committee: I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by manmade activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs. This sort of equivocation has become familiar during these confirmation hearings. Both Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and Scott Pruitt, his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, have said they accept the climate is changing but have voiced doubts over the extent of human culpability for this. Scientists, on the other hand, are pretty clear on this point – the world is warming due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. We’ve picked up the climate blog in the US, and have heard from outgoing EPA boss Gina McCarthy who says staff there are nervous about the incoming administration’s attitude to science and climate change. We’ve also published the first of our three videos from solar panel clad buildings in New York City. Coming up later we also have a live video from our partners Univision who are blogging live in Spanish today on climate change. At around 1pm ET (6pm GMT) we’ll host a live video report from them in Miami on the climate change threat. Miami is just one of the places on the US coast already being impacted by rising sea levels. Highlights of our blog so far include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Brooklyn Navy Yard, a huge industrial park located across the water from Manhattan in New York City, installed a 3,152 solar panel field on top of one of its buildings in September. The yard, which is home to 300 businesses with 7,000 employees, expects to generate 1.1m kilowatt hours of energy each year – which it says is the equivalent of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.4m pounds and saving 76,000 gallons of gasoline each year. The panels cover an area bigger than a football field on the top of a warehouse close to the East river, overlooking downtown Manhattan. “Sustainability has long been a core corporate value of ours,” said Clare Newman, chief of staff and executive vice-president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard corporation. “And our tenants and our businesses really care about and embody the same values.” The project was paid for by Con Ed solutions, a subsidiary of the larger Con Ed energy company. Con Ed solutions secured $625,863.83 in incentives from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which promotes energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. We’re looking at all of the issues around climate change – including the solutions. And both New York City – and the wider state – are among the trailblazers in the US when it comes to solar power. In New York City there are thousands of buildings which have been fitted with solar panels. During the US hours of our climate change blog, we’ll have three videos for you from Adam Gabbatt, who we sent to the top of skyscrapers and other buildings in the city to find out how they make that work. One of the big areas of concern around the incoming Trump administration is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We’ve published a story earlier Thursday on an interview with the agency’s outgoing administrator, Gina McCarthy. She told me that there is “nervousness” among EPA staff that Trump’s incoming administration will sideline science and reverse action on climate change. McCarthy told the Guardian that the Trump administration would face resistance from multiple fronts if it ran counter to a widespread shift to renewable energy, as well as scientific opinion, by rejecting climate science and attempting to bolster the fossil fuel industry. Trump has promised to reduce the EPA to “tidbits” and has nominated the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to run the agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times over its pollution regulations, has questioned established climate science and has been criticized by environment groups for his ties to oil and gas interests. “People at the EPA will be respectful of the new administration but they will continue to do their jobs,” said McCarthy, who was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 to head the regulator. “I would not be telling the truth if I said there was no sense of nervousness. There is a sense of nervousness that the new administration will take decisions not in line with the science. Read more of the interview with McCarthy here. Hello and welcome to the American portion of our climate blog, on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration. Oliver Milman in New York and Alan Yuhas in San Francisco will see you through. The new president will forever be reminded of his tweet that claimed that global warming “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. But that conspiracy theory was expounded four years ago now and Trump’s attitude to climate change, like much else, has wobbled in the wind. Where once climate science was apparently just an excuse for a “very, very expensive form of tax”, Trump conceded in November there may in fact be “some connectivity” between human activity and warming. On the campaign trail Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris climate deal but now Rex Tillerson, his choice for secretary of state, insists that the US will still have a “seat at the table” in climate talks. Climate change may be the defining challenge of our time, but the response of the world’s superpower remains clouded in doubt just a day before its new president takes power. Trump has been consistent, however, in his steadfast support for fossil fuels, even donning a miner’s helmet during a rally in West Virginia to promise – in the face of economic reality – that coal mining jobs will return. Environmental groups fear the worst – emissions reduction plans trashed, climate funding scrapped, scientists harassed or muzzled and a vacuum of international leadership that may encourage other countries to ease off their own efforts. Trump’s cabinet picks will be key and the signs are ominous. Incredibly, Tillerson, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant that actively suppressed its own knowledge of climate change for decades, may be the one most in line with mainstream science. Trump’s nominations for the Environmental Protection Agency and the department of interior, to name just two, have raised doubts over whether humans really are influencing the climate and have been showered in donations from polluters. We will look at each of these cabinet picks, as well as outline some of the key climate issues facing the Trump presidency. The next four years could well see havoc from severe storms, rising seas, scorching heatwaves and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Pertinently for Trump, these calamities could just as likely occur in the US as some far-flung country. Even his own resort at Mar-a-Lago in Florida could be at risk. A response beyond blaming the Chinese will be required. So that’s about it from this part of the world. We are off for a lie down in a dark room. Stay tuned though for much, much more from the Americas, hosted by Oliver Milman and Alan Yuhas. For anyone just tuning in, highlights of this blog so far today include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot – ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away I leave you with this: A quick interruption with some breaking news: Scotland has just unveiled some of the world’s most ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions, aiming at a reduction of 66% within 15 years. It’s not quite Norway (which is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030), but it’s a laudable aim, reports our Scotland editor Severin Carrell, who has all the detail here. Hoesung Lee: ‘Climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action’ Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is up next, talking to Juliette. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? We are continuing to emit greenhouse gases and if unabated this will cause further warming and changes to the climate system. This increases the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Substantial and sustained reduction in emissions are needed to limit climate change.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Individuals can do many things, depending on their local and personal circumstances. One example is improving energy efficiency. Ultimately [though] tackling climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I’d like to congratulate Mr Trump on his forthcoming inauguration as President of the United States. We look forward to continuing to work with the new administration, and with American scientists and institutions, on improving our understanding of climate change and how to tackle its impacts and risks, as we have done for nearly 30 years, since the inception of the IPCC.” Mark Campanale: Fossil fuel investors ‘will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on’ Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative thinktank and who conceived the idea that many fossil fuel reserves will be unburnable if the world beats climate change, talks to Damian now: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There is no doubt now that we’re in the middle of a major technological revolution in the transportation and power sectors. Electrification of the transport fleet and the rise of cheap solar isn’t going to be reversed, actually it will accelerate. The real question right now is whether technological leaps and cost reductions in renewables can accelerate adoption rates fast enough. The scale of the challenge is enormous – not helped by new investments in fossil fuels exceeding tens of trillions of dollars over the next few decades. For that reason, we may not be seeing the reductions in fossil fuel power generation capacity that we need. Instead of investors looking at fossil fuel companies as ‘ex growth’ stocks, they are too many that take a ‘business as usual’ growth approach to their investment. Time will tell, but our expectation is that investors [anticipating ‘business as usual’ growth from fossil fuel stocks] will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on. The real risk is that the precious years we’ve got to make the difference we need to the future will have been tied up trying to defend the past. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Switch to a clean energy supplier like Good Energy, or maybe a community utility and project developer like Mongoose Energy. May Boeve: ‘The climate movement is more important than ever’ May Boeve, head of climate campaign group 350.org, is next up: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? I think we’ve entered into a new chapter in the climate fight. Renewables have become cheap and widespread enough to represent a real threat to the fossil fuel industry, so they’re beginning to fight back. If we can make it beyond the political barriers coming up worldwide and elect governments who take climate change seriously, we have all the technology we need to make rapid progress and succeed in keeping global warming as close to 1.5C as possible. But it’s going to be a real fight. The work of the climate movement is more important than ever. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Organize. We can’t solve climate change alone. Get together with people and change your community, your country, and the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history. Ed Davey: ‘To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar’ Former climate secretary and Liberal Democrat MP now talks to Juliette Jowit What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The Paris agreement surpassed my expectations about what’s possible - although it’s still not enough, given where we are. We have had president Obama’s leadership, Xi Jinping’s (China’s) leadership, and president Modi’s (India’s) leadership. Then we had technological break-throughs, particularly solar.” What is your message to President Donald Trump? To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar. Where does Isis’ power come from? They are funded by oil and gas, particularly oil.” It would be wrong to think that Donald Trump’s views on climate change reflect those of the American people. While the incoming president is dismissive of the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is real, serious and driven by human activity, the US population is not. A survey in November for the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 70% of Americans think climate change is real, and just over half, 55%, believe humans are mostly to blame. The figures are encouraging. But they make clear that the US public, like those in other countries, lags far behind the scientific opinion. The fact is that many people still don’t accept that climate change is driven by human activities, and that it is serious enough to warrant action. In the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast today, we explore why climate change risks can be hard for us to take on board. Debika Shome at the TCC Group co-authored a report for Columbia University on the psychology of climate change communication. She explains how the perception that global warming is a problem for people who live far away and far in the future, combines with scientific jargon and the inherent uncertainty around climate predictions to make climate change messages an exceptionally tough sell. But here, another field of science can help. Understand human psychology better, and the messages can be made to hit home, she says. During the US presidential re-election campaign in 2012, Matthew McGregor, now at Precision Strategies in New York, ran Barack Obama’s digital rapid response team. Matthew is not an expert on climate change, but he does know how to mobilise people to take action. We asked him how he would make people care more about climate change. Facts, he says, are not enough. Also lending advice is Tima Bansal, professor of sustainability at Ivey Business School in Ontario. The climate change problem cannot be solved without help - and sometimes radical changes in behaviour - from businesses, large and small. But with little incentive to change their ways, what can we as consumers do to force corporations to act in the world’s best interests? As Bansal explains, it could be easier than you think. Ben van Beurden: ‘We don’t have to sacrifice economic growth’ Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell plc, now: It’s good news for all of us that [the Paris climate agreement] came into force. The scenarios that we and others have done clearly show that a future of net-zero emissions is technically feasible near the end of the century. And not only can the world achieve it technically, but it also makes economic sense in a societal way. In other words, we don’t have to sacrifice economic growth. That’s the good part. The remaining challenge is: can it be done commercially? Economically is about the way society can bear it, commercially is about how to make sure the main actors – consumers and companies – can, and will, do the right thing. And if society, through government, doesn’t ensure it makes commercial sense to move to a net-zero emissions energy system, nobody will make the next step. The good thing is that the Paris agreement raised the bar for everyone. Everybody feels the obligation to act. So in that sense I’m actually very optimistic. The nature of the challenge of climate change is that it will require unprecedented levels of co-operation between government, industry and society. What often tends to happen in our industry is that you have either isolated advocacy, or people have a very adversarial approach: I’m for, you’re against. In the end this doesn’t resolve anything. It just creates noise for policymakers. We have to move beyond that and start real collective planning for how we are going to achieve the kind of energy transition the world needs. Craig Bennett: This is ‘decade zero’ Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, talks to Damian ... What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The climate impacts of global temperature rises of just 1C have already triggered melting ice-caps, unleashed killer storms and droughts, bleached the world’s coral reefs, choked our cities with pollution and displaced people from their homes. The case for urgent action is now universally accepted by governments, scientists, business and ordinary citizens around the world. Whilst trillions of dollars are being invested in the renewable energy sector and building a low carbon economy, this is still too little and too slow. This is ‘decade zero’: The decisions we make now on meeting our energy needs, producing our food and protecting our forests will determine if we can keep temperature rises well below 2C and prevent catastrophic climate change. We’re sitting in the last chance saloon but governments still seem unable to break their addiction to dirty energy – unless people power can make them. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Renewable energy and the low carbon economy is the world’s greatest job creator. Be smart, and lead from the front. Clean energy, owned by American citizens, acting in the interests of American citizens will not only make ‘America Great Again’, it will save lives and protect your nation too. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Be part of the movement to ‘keep fossil fuels in the ground’. It’s as simple as that. Divest your money from banks that fund it, switch energy suppliers to green energy, support communities saying no to fracking, demand our politicians act now before it’s too late. And join an environmental organisation like Friends of the Earth. Professor Dame Julia King: ‘Trump needs to build an economy for 2050, not 1950’ Prof Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change is next up, talking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? To have a good chance of keeping global temperature rise to below 2C the world will need to reverse the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero within the next 50 years or so. This involves switching to clean forms of electricity, transport, cooling and heating, and finding ways to avoid – or mop up – emissions from industry, agriculture, shipping and air travel. We are not currently on track to achieve this, but global momentum is building quickly. What is encouraging is that many companies, cities and citizens are now taking a leading role, alongside pledges and action from governments around the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950! What is the best action concerned citizens can take? The Committee on Climate Change recently looked at how to reduce UK emissions over the next 15 years. We found that some of the best things people can do to reduce their household-level carbon footprint are: Save money, by making your home energy efficient, and making choices on food and travel that lower costs and emissions. Take advantage of new technologies – if you drive, switch to a fully electric vehicle and look at a smart home energy system. Make your voice heard, by, for example, continuing to talk to your local politician and others to urge them to act, find out what companies your pension fund invests in and write to the trustees to encourage them to switch to ‘low carbon’ investments. Michael Liebreich: ‘Wind and solar now the cheapest new power sources in much of the world’ Now it’s Michael Liebreich, founder of analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance and who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy, speaking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The past decade gives us enormous cause for optimism. Relentless growth in global CO2 emissions has been brought to a halt much earlier than anyone thought possible. Wind and solar power have become the cheapest new power sources in much of the world; natural gas is outcompeting carbon-intensive coal; LEDs and other energy efficiency solutions are being installed at scale; and electric vehicles are starting to fly out of showrooms. But it’s not enough to stabilise emissions: to stay within a 2C carbon budget we have to see emissions cut dramatically and quickly, which remains a staggering challenge. The Paris agreement set out ambitious long-term aspirations, but its near-term commitments don’t add up to much. In particular, if Asian countries build all the coal-fired power stations currently in their plans, then kiss goodbye to the 2C warming target. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America Great Again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Focus on a few big things. If you are renovating, insist on lots of insulation, good windows, a good boiler and efficient appliances. You can cut your fuel bills by 75% – I know because I’ve done it. If you live in a city, get rid of your car: join a car club, walk or cycle more, use cabs and public transport. Again, I know because I haven’t owned a car in London for 22 years. And don’t fly short-haul, use trains – you’ll get there quicker too. John Schellnhuber: ‘We are now at a watershed in history’ Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised Angela Merkel, the Pope and the EU, now speaks to Damian Carrington. We are now at a watershed in history I think, because the traditional industrialised countries – US, UK, parts of Europe, Australia – are now more or less giving up being pioneers for climate action and it is emerging economies [like China and India] that are doing the bold steps. The world is upside down really. The old developed world has more or less lost faith in saving the planet and it is the new economies who seem to take the lead. This is the hope we have. Politicians can’t do it on their own. The political process is so slow and dysfunctional almost everywhere. There are two factors that can accelerate our transition to sustainability. One is clearly technological progress, which is often much faster than anybody expects. The other is civil society, you have to put pressure on your politicians. You have to raise the moral bar much higher. You have ask them ‘do we want to save this planet for our descendents or not? On the actions concerned individuals can take, Schellnhuber said three things stick out: Try to avoid using airplanes. Whenever you do a carbon balance sheet, you see flying is just the worst thing you can do regarding your carbon footprint and often it is more convenient to take a train these days. Second is to reduce your meat consumption, if you eat any, and that is also good for your health. The third one is follow the money: the fossil fuel divestment movement. Tell your bank manager you would like your money be invested into renewables instead of coal, oil and gas industry. At least become a pain in the neck. What companies fear like hell is loss of reputation, as that can break even the big companies’ necks. Nicholas Stern: ‘Destruction of the environment would reverse economic growth’ Leading climate change economist Lord Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, has also spoken to Damian Carrington for this blog. Stern said global action on climate change has made substantial progress, with the Paris agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals creating a global agenda for the first time since the end of the second world war. It was agreed by everybody and applies to everybody. That is extremely important and quite extraordinary when you think how difficult it is to put together a global agenda with 196 countries. But he said it was openly acknowledged that the Paris deal leaves a big gap between the current plans and what is needed to avoid 2C of global warming - the danger limit agreed by the world’s nations. The next very big question is how do we ramp up those ambitions. China, the biggest emitter, is ahead of the game. It said it would peak [its carbon emissions] by 2030, but my guess is it will peak not very long after 2020. That is the key example. I have been working in China for 30 years and the change over the last six to seven is quite remarkable. India is starting to get much more committed too. So if you look at the two countries with the biggest populations, you do see changes. But the US and Europe will matter greatly to this. It is very important Europe raises its game. Stern said Donald Trump needs to back the green economy to take advantage of the growing global demand for clean energy, which is being driven by the worldwide commitment to tackling global warming. If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth. Stern said concerned individuals should put pressure on governments and businesses: Demand explicitly and directly strong action from the politicians, particularly in cities where we know action can be extremely rapid. Do your shopping at firms that are responsible. It does need political, business and civil society push. The reason is that the urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood. We will double the world economy in the next 20 years or so. If we build this new world economy anything like the old one, then we are not going to get down to the [emissions] we have to be. There has to be radical change. Professor James Hansen Director of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and ‘father of climate change awareness’ spoke to the Guardian after winning the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? “The global temperature has increased since 1970 at about 0.18C per decade, and it’s going to continue at approximately that rate, because the climate change is driven by environmental imbalance: there’s more energy going in from the sun than out into space, because of the climate change gases. “The climate impacts are extremely detrimental, and the worst one is seal level rise, because of the ice sheets going unstable, [and] the economic and humanitarian cost of that is devastating.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? “The single most important thing [individuals] can do is to join Citizens Climate lobby: they [and] other organisations advocate a simple rising carbon fee. People that join are asked to write letters to the editor, op eds [comments in newspapers], write to representatives, legislators, and they do it in a respectful way. What is your message to President Donald Trump? “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” Photographs of the melting Greenland ice sheet by Timo Lieber are a beautiful but chilling reminder of the impact of climate change. All photographs use three colours. Each represents a symbolic value: pristine white is the ice sheet, blue is water and black is dirt. These colours form the chromatic point of view and are the clue to reading them. Beyond this simplicity, the pictures are scientific documents that reveal and link the two global phenomenons: global warming and atmospheric pollution. “The images are deliberately abstract.” says Timo Lieber in an interview by Tim Walker. “I didn’t want them to be documentary photographs. You have to get close to find the small, hidden details that help you to understand what you’re seeing. They’re beautiful, but what you’re looking at is climate change at its worst. My favourite is the one that looks like an eye. It’s a half-circle of concentric blues at the top of the image – it’s almost as if global warming is looking right back at you.” UN climate chief: ‘There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need’ Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - the UN’s climate chief – today gives her views on climate change to our head of environment Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There are very positive actions and signals from all areas of society post-Paris [climate agreement] including from governments and cities to business, investors and citizens. But the reality is also that greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere continue to rise and thus national and international ambition needs to rise even more. The world needs to peak global emissions urgently and trigger a steady but significant de-carbonisation of the global economy so that year on year and decade on decade the total achievement is in line with the science. We are on the way towards a better, climate-secure world, but it will be a long journey and only a sense of urgency will get us to the ‘well below 2C target’. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need. Get informed and get involved. Be a conscious-consumer for example: there is wealth of information on the environmental footprint of goods and services. Think about how you travel, and try to choose a lower emissions form of transport while offsetting those emissions you cannot avoid right now. 2017 is the UN’s International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development – take time to do so research on the sustainability of your holiday and leisure activities. If you are lucky enough to have a pension or investments, find out how your money is being used – is it supporting environmentally-sustainable companies or not. Get more involved in your community and city — actively argue and support public transport policies; renewable energy; energy efficient initiatives and ones to back forests; wetlands and other nature-based ‘infrastructure’. Thanks Damian. I hope that hour answered lots of your questions. If not, keep them coming. New York will take over from us within the next hour, and our US environment correspondent Oliver Milman will be at the helm. Here’s another fact for you: Coming up: what are the best books and films about climate change? What animals are most at risk from climate change right now? Plus: a word with the experts, unfashionable as they may be in some quarters these days. We’ve spoken to a plethora of leading figures climate change debate and found a surprising amount of consensus about what needs to happen next to our climate. Last question I’m afraid, but it’s a good one, from ‏@takvera. Low. Although you are right that those ice caps are very vulnerable to global warming, it takes a long time to melt such big chunks of ice. But in coming centuries, the risk is very real. The last time the Earth had CO2 levels as high as this, sea level was many metres above what it is today. That would wipe out many of the world’s biggest cities. ‏@OisinMoriarty asks about electric car takeup. A long way is the truth, but the takeup is accelerating very fast. There were about 2m electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2016. That’s just 1% of the market in Europe and China. But as cheaper models with longer ranges arrive and cities crack down on air pollution, more and more will take to the roads. On Twitter, ‏@FourTwoThreeOne asks: Right here, right now is the answer. Scorching heatwaves are already five times more likely thanks to global warming and it’s not going to get better until carbon emissions start to fall. You can read more here. MercuryBen asks a political question. Why is it that climate change scepticism is so popular with those on the right-wing? I’d suggest two reasons. First is that tackling global warming requires communal action, which for those libertarians far to the right looks just like communism. Communism is evil, therefore climate change can’t exist. The second reason is that the fossil fuel lobby gives far more money to rightwing politicians, as they are seen to be more “pro-business” than those on the left. But as the Tory politician John Gummer, now Lord Deben, argues today: “Conservatives cannot properly be climate deniers. At the heart of their political stance is a desire to hand on something better to the future than they have received from the past.” ID5865653 asks an important question about whether aviation can be made greener. Does anyone know what, if any, progress is being made on making flights more carbon neutral? I know there was a successful round-the-world solar flight in 2016, but that doesn’t seem likely to bear fruit commercially any time time soon. Are the fuel requirements just too large for electric planes etc to be practical? Flying does have a heavy carbon footprint – about 1 tonne for every economy passenger from London to New York and back. But I don’t think electric planes – like Solar Impulse – will ever carry many passengers. Batteries are just too heavy and solar panels need too much area. More likely is the adoption of a sustainable biofuel for jets, perhaps from algae, jatropha or even tobacco. But progress has been slow. For freight at least, air ships are a possible future alternative. For now, using a good carbon offset scheme is the only solution. The livestock industry causes about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and CordTrousers asks: Any suggestions other than vegetarianism? Meat does have a heavy carbon (and methane) footprint, but not all meat is equal. Beef has by far the biggest footprint, so cutting out that alone makes a big difference. Reducing meat consumption, rather than going vegetarian, is also an option backed by many, dubbed climatarian or reducatarian. As it happens, lots of people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy, so cutting back would help lengthen many lives. Also, lots of new companies are starting to produce vegetable-based substitutes for meat and dairy products, aiming to make them as tasty, healthy and affordable as the originals. PeppermintSeal wants to know what the impact of ocean acidification might be. Much of the world’s CO2 emissions end up being absorbed by the oceans, which become more acidic as a result. Regarding the increased acidity in the oceans, what follows from this? More coastal erosion and threat to sea life I’m guessing, but are there other things happening? Does acidity affect salt levels? Ocean acidification is real but research is still ongoing. This is from a UK research programme: “Already ocean pH has decreased by about 30% and if we continue emitting CO2 at the same rate by 2100 ocean acidity will increase by about 150%, a rate that has not been experienced for at least 400,000 years. Such a monumental alteration in basic ocean chemistry is likely to have wide implications for ocean life, especially for those organisms that require calcium carbonate to build shells or skeletons.” I think acidification is unlikely to affect salinity or coastal erosion. But rising sea levels and fiercer storms will affect coastlines. Lots of commenters, for example greensocialist147, are arguing that overpopulation is the fundamental problem. The world’s population is set to rise to 9 or 10 billion by 2050, which definitely makes beating climate change tougher. But the critical thing is the size of their carbon footprints. If they all cause the same emissions as today’s Americans or Australians, we are doomed to catastrophic climate change. But if, as is difficult but possible, emissions from energy, transport and buildings are reduced to very low levels, then a large global population can live sustainably on the planet. In terms of curbing population growth, poverty reduction, education for girls and availability of contraception for those who want it are vital. Crucial question next from yourcomment. Is it compulsory for every article on global warming to feature a photo of a polar bear? Why? Well, no. But they are beautiful animals and the Arctic is warming far faster than the rest of the planet. But the research here suggests, among many things, that images of real people are effective ways to communicate the significance of climate change, too. Reader rokealy wants to know how climate change will affect the UK and Europe. This is such an important matter and delighted that you are covering this in such an excellent way. Really educational yet at the same time quite unsettling. With the rise in temperatures, and various reports coming to conclusions that Europe will get warmer or colder, can you give a clearer picture of what we (Ireland, UK, Europe) can expect to see in our climate in the near future? The short answer is: more extremes. With more heat in the atmosphere, there’s more energy to drive more extreme events, such as storms. In the UK, the main consequences are more severe flooding and more deadly heatwaves, which the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, say are high risks already. Summers are likely to get drier and hotter overall and winters warmer and wetter. But there will also be extreme cold snaps, probably driven by the fast-melting ice in the Arctic. Next up is a question from Clare Rudkin, on whether global warming can be blamed for specific events. I would like to know the percent of increase in likelihood of events that seem to be linked to climate change. Weather has a lot of natural variability, but climate changes increases the chances of many types of extreme weather – loading the dice, if you like. Scientists are getting better and faster at calculating how much the probability of heatwaves etc occurring are increased by global warming. In some cases, it’s a lot. Warm sea temperatures linked to severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef were made at least 175 times more likely, the extreme Russian heatwave of 2010 was made three times more likely, major floods in Paris in 2016 were made almost twice as likely. Hi! I’m Damian Carrington, head of environment at the Guardian, and I’ll be tackling your climate questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please post anything you’d like to ask in the comments below or tweet me @dpcarrington. Here’s the first one, from Sandie Elsom. Congratulations on deciding to focus on this most important of all issues. I’d like to see clear explanations of what the science is saying and just how serious the outcomes will be. I have difficulty convincing family members that climate change is a clear and present danger. These webpages by Nasa are very good: clear and striking. You could also take a look at the assessment of the world’s scientists produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It concludes that global warming is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly. The assessment involved thousands of scientists – probably the biggest scientific review in human history – and was approved by 196 nations, making it as definitive as it gets. Journalism often tends to focus on the problems, and as such can often give a glum view of the world. But during this hour we’ve heard from: The Egyptian hydroponics farmer trying to beat the drought the team at the Thames Barrier in London, the kind of tech that might be needed elsewhere in the world the British Antarctic Survey, keeping tabs on climate change at the bottom of the earth some of the innovators offering 21st-century ideas to fix a 21st-century problem Soon we’re going to hand over to Damian Carrington, our head of environment, to answer your questions. But before we go, can I make a personal plea for you to consider joining us as a member? Journalism is a costly business, as I’m sure you can appreciate from the work that has gone into this product. But we do it because we believe things like this can make a difference, can help build the movement to roll back climate change. If everyone reading this blog gave just a small amount, we would be on a far firmer footing to keep producing work like this. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. Many thanks everyone. Here’s the hourly Twitter card: When it comes to green tech, the electricity sector has seen the biggest focus so far, with the cost of solar, wind, LED lighting and batteries plummeting in the last decade. The cost of conventional nuclear power has not, but so-called “small modular reactors” (SMR) are now attracting a lot of attention: smaller, cheaper and mass produced is the promise. An SMR design was recently submitted to regulators in the US, but Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, is not holding his breath. “I do laugh when people talk about SMRs being five years around the corner. The licensing conditions for nuclear – quite correctly – imply a very slow development process because you can’t mess around with it.” The great hope for nuclear for decades has been nuclear fusion, which carries the prospect of cleaner and limitless energy. However, even those building the biggest fusion experiment in the world – ITER in France – acknowledge that commercial nuclear fusion will not come before 2050, by which time global emissions will already have to be near zero. Much faster to deliver will be smart grids, which apply data and communication software to make far more efficient use of existing electricity, creating in effect “virtual power stations”. These, along with storage of intermittent renewable energy, are the most important technologies, say experts, allowing countries to move to 100% renewable energy on the grid. Big batteries are already replacing power plants in California. A breakthrough in battery chemistry to deliver cheaper, more powerful devices is being sought around the world but they are not the only way to store energy – a plant in the UK is already using air compressed into a liquid. New renewable technologies are also being investigated. Researchers are seeking breakthroughs in solar energy, a truly global energy source, aiming to make panels that capture even more of the sun by, for example, using perovskite crystals instead of silicon. I’ve been looking at all kinds of technology that promises to help us battle climate change in the decades to come. Of course, renewables have been a quiet success story over the past 20 years – but this is only half the picture. From solar air ships to lab-grown meat, algae jet fuel to nuclear fusion, technology innovations around the world hold the hope of slashing carbon emissions and giving a big boost to the battle against global warming. Mission Innovation, a collaboration involving 50 of the world’s biggest nations, is set to invest $30bn a year by 2020 on clean technology, and the UK’s special representative for climate change, Sir David King, played a leading role in its creation. One of his favourites is a huge new airship being developed by a British company, VariaLift, to provide low-carbon freight transport. The plan is to cover the airships with photovoltaics, then rise them to 50,000 feet where there is very little air resistance. Solar energy can then power the electrical engines and the airship could reach speeds of 340km/h. Also attracting attention is a German idea to store energy in regions without mountains, where pumped-water storage cannot be used. Heindl Energy’s solution is to raise a giant column of rock using the pumped water, which is then allowed to fall again when the energy is needed. The allure of new technology is strong, not only to speed up cuts in emissions, but also because of the colossal market it represents, offering good jobs and economic growth. The International Energy Agency estimates that $44tn will be invested in energy by 2040, with an ever bigger slice going to clean technologies. Of course, science is a vital part of our understanding of climate change, and down at the bottom of the earth, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are conducting a range of experiments and observations to keep tabs on any changes in conditions. The BAS collaborated with us to get exclusive video back from the Antarctic, and my colleague Irene Baqué put together this short package to show what’s going on. While flood defences are often criticised and the government is regularly accused of failing to account sufficiently for how much climate change is making it worse, the UK’s Thames barrier has been a real, unsung success story. Built in eight years, its six gates have never failed to protect London. In the early hours of last Saturday morning, Steve East made a judgment call to protect Londoners from the Thames. Faced with tidal and weather forecasts and other data, the engineering manager of the Thames Barrier decided to raise it for the second occasion in 2017 and the 178th time since it was finished in 1982. The result was a 3.3 metre differential – the height of the water level on the downstream side, which leads out to the North Sea, above the upstream side of central and west London, which the huge structure protects. “It’s an art, not a science because we are making decisions on forecasts,” he tells me, as we overlook the barrier where the rotating gates are raised in times of need. East started working as an administrator at the barrier 31 years ago. Over that he time, he’s not seen a linear line showing the barrier being closed more frequently, but a more jagged line with spikes in individual years. For example, in one recent year the barrier was closed on 50 occasions in just a three month period. Before that it had gone about two years without a closure. “It’s an easy decision to close it. The hard decision is not to close it,” he says. While closure protects Londoners and property from flooding, it also stops river traffic, wildlife such as seals, and puts a “strain on the asset”, as East puts it, wearing the barrier out. The barrier should last until about 2070. Climate change means a 20-90cm sea level rise in the Thames by 2100, according to the Met Office and Defra, and East is clear: “There’s an acknowledgment that sea level rise will require a new barrier.” Planning is just beginning on what location and size that barrier might take, but the project is anticipated to cost £10bn. Some of that money will go on raising and strengthening the tidal walls downstream of the barrier, and making space for water downstream to overflow into during tidal surges, such as car parks and playgrounds. East thinks that when the barrier starts having 50 closures a year regularly – at the moment the average is four annually – that’s when a new barrier will be needed. But for now – even with the two closures in less than a month this year – “we’re a long way from that”. Across the Middle East and north Africa, global warming means record temperatures, which in the summer can make life unbearable from Tehran to Tripoli. The knock-on impact on farming in the region has been severe – indeed some people have even blamed the Arab spring partly on the way climate change has depleted agriculture. But some enterprising farmers are finding ways to beat the drought, like this Egyptian extolling the virtues of hydroponic farming – that uses more than 95% less water by not planting in soil. A final three tips on positive individual action here from Chris Goodall: • For a decade, investors ignored the movement that advocated the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. Large fuel companies and electricity generation businesses were able to raise the many billions of new finance they needed. Now, by contrast, money managers are increasingly wary of backing the investment plans of oil companies and switching to renewable projects. And universities and activist investors around the world are selling their holdings in fossil fuels, making it more difficult for these companies to raise new money. Vocal support for those backing out of oil, gas and coal helps keep up the pressure. • Politicians tend to do what their electorates want. The last major UK government survey showed that 82% of people supported the use of solar power, with only 4% opposed. A similar survey in the US showed an even larger percentage in favour. The levels of support for onshore wind aren’t much lower, either in the US or the UK. We need to actively communicate these high levels of approval to our representatives and point out that fossil fuel use is far less politically popular. • Buy gas and electricity from retailers who sell renewable power. This helps grow their businesses and improves their ability to provide cost-competitive fuels to us. Renewable natural gas is just coming on to the market in reasonable quantities in many countries and fossil-free electricity is widely available. Think about switching to a supplier that is working to provide 100% clean energy. Chris’s 15 things you can do to help stop manmade climate change is published in full here. Have we really been going five hours? We’re just getting warmed up. No pun intended. If you’re waking up in America, stay tuned: our New York office will be taking over this running article in a couple of hours, with the focus switching to the inauguration tomorrow. In the past hour, we’ve really only had time to skim the surface of some of the good things going on in this time zone: the Afghan hero trying to reforest an entire province the Israelis who turn salt water into drinkable stuff – and export the technology around the world the Swedes building a carbon sink in Stockholm Please do post your questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, to answer, or you can email him on damian.carrington@theguardian.com. He’ll be with us at 1pm GMT. And here’s another fact for you: Right then. We’ve not nearly finished with good news so we’re going to carry on past the hour with more inspiring people and technology, starting with the Egyptian farmer beating the drought with smart water-saving kit. This month sees the launch in Stockholm of the world’s first urban carbon sink. The project will trap carbon from garden waste and store it in the ground, thereby compensating for the emissions of around 700 cars. The idea is based on turning wood and other organic waste into “biochar”, produced like charcoal by heating it in the absence of oxygen. The first firings will make use of thousands of discarded Christmas trees. In the shadow of a large conventional power station in the southern suburbs, the new carbon sink will produce 300 tonnes of biochar a year, which will then be used to fertilise the city’s parks and green spaces. In turn, heat generated during the process will be used to heat local apartments. Simon Rea, of of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which is sponsoring the project, told me: This is the world’s first urban carbon sink. We want other cities to be inspired by Stockholm and start their own biochar production. Combatting “climate apathy” in this way is seen as an important aspect of the project, which wants to involve Stockholmers and make them feel that they themselves have a role to play in influencing the climate. The project organisers say that three more cities and a US federal state have already shown an interest: Melbourne in Australia, Mysore in India, Parma in Italy, and the state of California. Mattias Gustafsson of Stockholm Water, told me: It is just the beginning. This natural carbon sink will not save the world but we must begin to pay off our carbon debts. Israel has long experience of dealing with some of the pressing demands of climate change. Inside the high pressure hall at the world’s largest water desalination plant on the Israeli coast near Rishon Lezion, a forest of pressure vessels is humming with the sound of sea water being made drinkable at the equivalent of 65 atmospheres. The plant, completed just three years ago, is at the cutting edge of a desalination technology being exported around the world from China to India, to California and Australia, promising new sources of water in a warming world. The success of the Sorek plant and others like it in Israel – built by Israel Desalination Engineering [IDE] – is a testament to recent leaps made in desalination technology. One hundred years ago the British in Mandatory Palestine predicted that water would be an issue for a growing population, a challenge that has obsessed Israeli politicians over the decades. Today, Israel is a net exporter of water and its desalination plants provide almost 65% of the country’s potable and industrial water. Advances in reverse osmosis water purification technology have made it possible to build plants large and small, and increasingly environmentally friendly, allowing the production of drinkable water wherever there is access to the sea. The process is fast and relatively cheap. In the space of the Guardian’s visit to the plant, sea water extracted from the Mediterranean was cleaned once by being passed through large filtration tanks, cleaned a second time, then filtered in the high pressure hall before having traces of boron removed in a cascade and then treated to soften the water and make it drinkable. Udi Tirosh, of IDE, told me: There has long been an interest here in water recovery. Water shortages are a world issue. California has suffered six years of successive droughts. We are working on a new plant north of San Diego as well as a facility in Tienjiang south of Beijing in China which also has water shortage issues – a thermal extraction plant in this case. In India we are working on a plant for an industrial concern. Terry Macalister, formerly the Guardian’s energy editor and now on the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series steering committee, has just sent this blog post in to us: Terry writes: Global carbon emissions could be cut by one third within 12 months if affluent westerners changed their way of life, according at least to one leading climate change scientist. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the UK’s Manchester University, says a major reduction in personal air travel is a key starting point. More than half of the Co2 pollution which causes global warming comes from the 10% best-off people on the planet, he argues. “Let’s be clear about this. If the top 10 high emitters – people like you and me and others – if we reduce our carbon footprint just to the level of the average European it would be a one-third cut in global emissions. “I genuinely think we could achieve it in one year but we would have to think that climate change is a very serious issue and that has big political implications.” Anderson, who already avoids flying where he can, made his comments in the run up to a talk he will give on 9 March at Cambridge University. This is part of a new town and gown initiative, the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series, designed to rekindle more debate on global warming. Anderson is convinced that wealthy westerners must act decisively and radically to change their lifestyles. “Those of us who are high emitters … need to rapidly curtail how often we fly. We should not be flying on any occasion business class or first class because that has far higher emissions. We need to find alternatives to flying. “But in addition, we need to make sure that we are not living in larger houses and have many houses, and drive larger cars. “Our high incomes allow us to have status in society and typically have larger carbon footprints. It is a real challenge for us in that position because we have to significantly change in the short-term our lives and find other ways of seeing value for hard work.” Anderson plans to use his talk to explain what kind of personal, societal and corporate changes need to be made in Britain to meet the UK government’s commitment under the Paris climate change agreement. Afghanistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – but some people are trying to make a difference. An estimated 80% of Afghanistan’s natural resources have been destroyed over four decades of conflict, Ahmad Seyer, director of the Rural Green Environmental Organisation (RGEO) and one of the few Afghan charities working to mitigate the effects of climate change, has told me. Seyer, a civil engineer by training, worked to protect the environment since the mid-1990s, during the Taliban regime, when he worked with international agencies. But it was not until three years ago that he really became aware of the problems associated with climate change. Since then, climate change has been an integral part of the environment awareness training his organisation provides to mosques and schools. In most villages where I go, they actually understand. Climate change is visible to them now. There is not enough snow, and not enough rain. RGEO works across 90 villages in Badakhshan in Afghanistan’s remote northeast to protect biodiversity. Only three percent of Afghanistan’s surface is covered by forests. Loggers and people in need of wood to burn during winter threaten what is left. RGEO has reforested 200,000 trees to help absorb greenhouse gases and provide protection for communities during flash floods, which hit Badakhshan almost every year. Last year, following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake, a flood destroyed over 800 homes in the province. However, while a more sustainable environment would help boost livelihoods in the long term, for many families, economic concerns, compounded by war and unemployment, are more immediate. Farmers have had to sell livestock to survive. Many migrate to Iran to work as day labourers, and some choose to join the insurgency, Seyer said. “Compared to previous years, people have become so poor,” he said. In 2015, RGEO received the UN’s Equator Prize, which has helped boost funding for his organisation. It now runs on about $100,000 over the next couple of years, about half of which is provided by the United Nations Development Program. Faced with the task of convincing fellow Afghans, living in dire conditions, to care about the environment, Seyer said he was dismayed to see the incoming American president scoff at climate change. “This is not a joke. Please fight against climate change,” he said, addressing Donald Trump. “NGOs can’t do this alone. Hundreds of people can’t do it; thousands of people can’t do it. Everybody needs to come together.” Back to more positive actions that individuals can take. For obvious reasons most of these tips (again from Chris Goodall) focus on what wealthier citizens (which includes most westerners) can do. Here are three: • The CO2 impact of goods and services is often strikingly different from what you’d expect. Mike Berners-Lee’s book How Bad Are Bananas? takes an entertaining and well-informed look at what really matters. Bananas, for example, are fine because they are shipped by sea. But organic asparagus flown in from Peru is much more of a problem. • Invest in your own sources of renewable energy. Putting solar panels on the roof still usually makes financial sense, even after most countries have ceased to subsidise installation. Or buy shares in new cooperatively owned wind, solar or hydroelectric plants that are looking for finance. The financial returns won’t be huge – perhaps 5% a year in the UK, for example – but the income is far better than leaving your money in a bank. • Buy from companies that support the switch to a low-carbon future. An increasing number of businesses are committed to 100% renewable energy. Unilever, the global consumer goods business, says its operations will be better than carbon-neutral by 2030. Those of us concerned about climate change should buy from businesses acting most aggressively to reduce their climate impact. Over the next hour we’re going to try to focus on the positive. We’ll look more at what we can all do as individuals, and at inspirational work both locally and internationally to combat manmade climate change. It’s really easy to feel despairing and overwhelmed about climate change. Personally I found this piece by Chris Goodall today to be both inspiring and cheering. He writes about how he used to believe that only massive government subsidies would make clean energy a success, which basically meant it would be a failure. Now he admits he was “completely wrong” about that, and argues that the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight: In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified, because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. The full article is here. So Europe might not be on the frontline of climate change but it’s already feeling the depradations of flooding, drought, and rising sea levels. Over the past hour we’ve reported on: •In Italy, questions as to whether climate change might transform wine making. •Insurers reporting a sharp increase in weather-related payouts. •And we are still trying to draw climate change. Finally, another fact for you: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ Of course, different parts of Europe face different challenges. In Spain, Sam Jones reports that some forecasters believe that southern Spain will be reduced to desert by 2100 if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked. Researchers looked at the consequences for vegetation in the Mediterranean basin under a variety of possible temperature rises. In the worst case scenario – which would see global temperatures rising by nearly 5C by the end of the century – deserts would expand northwards across southern Spain and Sicily, and deciduous forests would be replaced by Mediterranean vegetation. Roughly a third of Spain would find itself as arid by then as the Tabernas desert in Almería is today. As one ecologist has pointed out, a rise of nearly 5C would be “like bringing Casablanca to Madrid”. This warming has implications for the Alps too. The Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner, says that in the Italian resort of Obereggen, sometimes it has not been cold enough to give the town much time to crank up its snow production. Resident Thomas Ondertoller told her: Last year we had one week to make the snow. We use a lot of water, and a lot of technical expertise, to make as much snow as possible, because usually after that there is a warm period. For the passionate skier, the product is perfect. For the romantic skier, something is missing,” he says. Further north, it is the sea, not the snow that is the problem, Jennifer Rankin reports from Belgium. Authorities in Flanders, guardians of Belgium’s 73km strip of coastline, are spending €8m (£6.9m) to investigate whether they can build an island to keep the rising tide at bay. The newest bit of Belgium would be off the coast of Knokke, the genteel resort best known for its picturesque dunes and posh golf course. Under an early plan, the island would be 40 hectares big, but could be made 10 times larger over time. Across the border, the Dutch have built the world’s biggest storm barrier, near Rotterdam. The Maeslant barrier – two enormous steel gates almost as long as the Eiffel tower – is designed to protect the port city and the rest of southern Holland from a once in a 10,000-year storm. Peter Persoon, an engineer-turned-tour guide, said: What we tell the people here in the Netherlands is, if the country is flooded the damage will be at least €700bn. If you instead spend every year one billion euros, you spread the bill over 700 years. That is, I think, the Dutch way.” For years, the biggest problem facing vineyard owners in Tuscany’s Chianti region has been the prevalence of scavaging wild boars in the area, a relatively modern phenomenon in the ancient winemaking region. But the threat of climate change could soon eclipse the havoc that has been wrought by the swine, according to a local climatologist who said changes in temperature are already having an effect on wine production in Italy. Giampiero Maracchi, a professor at the University of Florence and expert in sustainability and agriculture, says rising temperatures have already increased the amount of sugar in wines from the north to the south of Italy, though the change might not yet be noticeable. “For the time being, there has been no real negative effect on quality. For the future, it is yet to be seen,” he said. There has been another change related to climate that is sure to have a bigger impact: harvests in Chianti are now happening earlier than in the past. The harvest period used to be around 1 October, he said, but now it is happening between 1-15 September, often because of heatwaves. These are occurring with greater frequency and intensity in the summer months, leading to a faster maturation of the grapes. It means that in the future, in a decade to three decades from now, grapes in the Chianti region may require irrigation, which is not required now. “If we look to the models, with the projected increases in temperature, there will be a water shortage and probably in the future – 10 or 20 or 30 years – we should require some irrigation for grapes. It means we should have some reservoirs of water,” he said. Maracchi said the issue is not necessarily at the top of farmers’ minds, though it should be. “You know, up until the time comes that they can see some effect from the economic point of view, they are not concerned,” he said. “They should be, in my opinion, because climate change is a general problem and we [will] have a lot of trouble.” It is not just an Italian phenomenon. In its 2016 global wine output estimate, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine last year said it expected global wine production to drop by about 5% due to “climatic events”, causing steep drops in production in Chile and Argentina. While the group did not point a finger of blame at climate change specifically, it suggested that global warming, coupled with natural climate variability, were causing a profound change in the wine business, and had made 2016 one of the worst wine production periods in the past two decades. The other issue that looms for Europe is that of climate refugees. War and persecution have forced more people to flee their homes than at any time since records began. But droughts, flooding and storms are also having a catastrophic effect. Almost 60 million people around the world fled their homes in 2014 due to conflict, according to the UN agency for refugees. In the same year, 19.3 million were forced to move because of natural disasters, a study by the Norwegian Refugee Council concluded. Only a small number came to Europe. The majority fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa go to neighbouring countries or regions; most victims of extreme weather live in Asia. Nevertheless, European Union policymakers, struggling to cope with large numbers of recently-arrived migrants, are aware that climate refugees could be on their doorstep. This week the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, told the Guardian: Europe is also surrounded by regions that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and we can definitely not afford to ignore the links between climate change and migration. He is careful about drawing links between climate change and migration, saying that climate change can multiply instability, conflict and state fragility, prompting people to leave their homes. Statistics are difficult to pin down, partly because of the role environmental degradation plays in fuelling conflict. Scientists have said a devastating drought in Syria between 2006-2010 – and the weak response of Bashar al-Assad’s government – was a contributory factor to the ongoing conflict. British economist, Nicholas Stern, has estimated that up to 200 million people could be displaced by climate change by 2050. But not all will end up in safer places. People leaving desertified villages can move to towns lying on a flood-plain. Some will not afford to be able to move: natural disasters that impoverish communities make it harder for people to start again somewhere else. This means climate change is also likely to put more pressure on the EU’s humanitarian aid budget, worth €1.27bn (£1.1bn) in 2014. Stylianides says the EU is spending more on reducing the risk of disasters. But only 13% of EU aid is spent on prevention, while the demand for urgent humanitarian help is growing. The Guardian has published a leader article on Trump and climate change today. It makes the point that while Trump may be able to wreak a lot of damage on the climate front, it’s not all going to be up to him: There’s no doubt the world will lose out if America decides to relinquish global leadership on battling climate change. But Mr Trump’s fossil fuel plans are likely to flounder without higher hydrocarbon prices. No one will frack for gas unless profits can be made. Coal mines won’t reopen while shale gas is cheap. Instead, self-interest will undergird the fight against global warming. China will decarbonise to ensure its citizens don’t choke to death in its cities. The costs of clean energy are tumbling too, keeping nations on the path towards decarbonisation. The price of electric vehicles is dropping; offshore wind power has become dramatically cheaper. For the first time, the costs of wind and solar power have dropped to match those of fossil fuels. Last year was the first in which renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s biggest source of power-generating capacity. Countries such as India have ambitious plans for renewable energy. You can read the full leader here. More on Europe in a minute, including Belgian flood defences, poor snow at ski resorts (boo hoo) and the grave threat to Chianti ... But first something completely different. We’re going over to Facebook live to watch people draw climate change. You may laugh. This might not work. You may get a better view of what’s going on by going here. If global warming has a canary in the mine, perhaps it’s the insurance industry. After all, they are the people who have to pay out when extreme weather events hit. And in Europe, they’ve been paying out more and more in recent years, as an extraordinary succession of flooding and storms sweep the continent. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, have shown me data indicating that the number of devastating floods requiring big payouts has more than doubled since 1980. The firm’s latest data shows there were 30 flood events requiring insurance payouts in Europe last year – up from just 12 in 1980. Globally, 2016 saw 384 flood disasters, compared with 58 in 1980, although the greater proportional increase probably reflects poorer flood protections and lower building standards in the developing world. Munich Re’s Ernst Rauch told me: In Europe, we’ve seen a steep increase in flood events related to severe convective [thunder] storms. The frequency of flash floods has increased much more than river floods since 1980. Here’s the full article. Now then, something a bit different. Yesterday, the world’s leading temperature authorities announced that yes, 2016 was the hottest year on record, and that the world was on average 1.1C warmer than in pre-industrial times. The idea of rising temperatures can be hard to visualise. So why not sit back and listen to it instead: So the UK is by no means immune to climate change, and in the next hour, we’ll discover that that goes for Europe too. Do keep your comments coming – there’s a really vibrant debate going on below the line. If you would prefer a Spanish version, have a look at what our partners Univision are doing here. And if you fancy contributing something more artistic or visual, then Tumblr is the place to go. Finally, our fact of the hour, on the hour, every hour. Well, five minutes late – sorry about that. The UK’s attempts to cut its CO2 emissions are in real danger of being undermined unless ministers tackle the continuing erosion of peatlands, which store several billion tonnes of carbon, Scottish environment campaigners have warned. Recent studies estimate that damaged peatlands – most frequently found in upland areas, already release about 16m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year through erosion, burning for grouse shooting and overgrazing. Scientists expect that to worsen dramatically as rising temperatures dry out peatland in rain-starved areas, and extreme weather events increase, without concerted effort to protect and conserve them. That in turn will increase flash flooding of lowland towns and villages. Scientists estimate that Scottish peatlands, which cover about a quarter of Scotland’s landmass, lock up about 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2. Jonny Hughes, chief executive of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and chair of the UK’s International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) peatlands project said: Peatlands are just not in good enough health to withstand the effects of climate change in the coming decades. Watching peatland landscapes washed away due to climate change sounds like a dystopian nightmare. Yet climate modelling predicts it to be a very real threat, leading to the loss of millions of tonnes of carbon and the destruction of an entire living ecosystem.” Here are three more tips on individual action you can take to help, courtesy of Chris Goodall: LEDs (light-emitting diodes) have become cheap and effective. If you have any energy-guzzling halogen lights in your house – many people have them in kitchens and bathrooms – it makes good financial and carbon sense to replace as many as possible with their LED equivalents. They should last at least 10 years, meaning you avoid the hassle of buying new halogen bulbs every few months. Not only will your CO2 footprint fall, but because LEDs are so efficient, you will also help reduce the need for national grids to turn on the most expensive and polluting power stations at peak demand times on winter evenings. Frequent use of a tumble dryer will add to your energy bill to an extent that may surprise you. But when buying a new appliance, don’t assume you will benefit financially from buying the one with the lowest level of energy consumption. There’s often a surprising premium to really efficient fridges or washing machines. Consume less. Simply buying less stuff is a good route to lower emissions. A new woollen man’s suit may have a carbon impact equivalent to your home’s electricity use for a month. A single T-shirt may have caused emissions equal to two or three days’ typical power consumption. Buying fewer and better things has an important role to play. Turning our attention to the UK, climate change is already affecting parts of Britain, principally by increasing the risk of extreme flooding and heatwaves, and on Wednesday the government accepted almost all of the current and future risks set out by its official advisors, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The CCC’s report, published in July, concluded the UK was poorly prepared for global warming and set out six priority risk areas. The first two were rated as high risk now, with more action needed. Flooding already causes £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C. The deadly heatwave of 2003, which peaked at 38.5C in the UK, will be a normal summer by the 2040s, leading to heat-related deaths more than tripling. There are currently no policies to ensure homes, schools, hospitals and offices remain tolerable in high heat. Severe water shortages are expected as summers get drier and, by the 2050s, will extend across the UK. If temperatures are driven up significantly, many places in the UK will have a demand for water 2.5 times greater than that available. Climate change is likely to drive food prices up, with extreme weather leading to lost crops and price shocks. About 40% of UK food is imported, making the UK vulnerable to droughts and floods driven by climate change around the world. The proportion of prime farmland is expected to fall from 38% to 9% with significant warming, and crop growing in eastern England and Scotland could be ended by degraded soil and water shortages. Warming seas are pushing key species northwards, which may affect the entire marine food chain. New dangers may invade the UK as the climate gets warmer and requires urgent research. “The impacts are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants,” the report states. “Higher temperatures will lead to an increased risk of the Asian tiger mosquito, the vector of Chikungunya virus, dengue fever and Zika virus. The current risk remains low, but may increase in the future.” The CCC also warned that climate-stoked wars and migration around the world could have very significant consequences for the UK, through disrupted trade and more military intervention overseas. On Wednesday, environment minister Lord Gardiner said Our changing climate is one of the most serious environmental challenges that we face as a nation and that is why we are taking action, from improving flood defences across the country to securing our critical food and water supplies. Professor Hugh Montgomery, at University College London added: Acting on climate change can also boost people’s health. If we get it right, our efforts to tackle climate change avoid some of these risks, and directly benefit health: renewable power doesn’t generate health-damaging pollutants, for example, while walking or cycling improves health.” And with that in mind, here come some more tips: We’ve had some great comments below the line this morning. If you have any questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, please post them there. We’ll hold an answer session at 1pm. Herewith some intriguing comments. Stefana Broadbent wonders about a “spiral of silence” caused by people fearing to speak out: Another Guardian commenter discusses the importance of finding common ground, regardless of wider political stances: And this commenter wonders about personal responsibility. And finally LordInsect asked for a graphic on carbon emissions. I’m happy to say we have two: And this: Before we move on to Europe and the UK, this is a neat piece of work from my colleague Nick Evershed, the Guardian’s head of data and interactives in Australia. It shows how much carbon we are emitting right now – and how much we have “left to burn” if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. Nick’s calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons. Hard to visualise? Well let’s let the doomsday clock do the work: So in summary, we’ve been focussed on Africa over the past hour: rising sea levels in Alexandria disappearing glaciers in Mt Kenya an insurgency partially caused by climate change in west Africa and hungry people in the south And here’s another fact for our post-truth world: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ In South Africa meanwhile, an interesting distinction: while you might find plenty of climate change denial in western countries or oil powers, or even in the White House (from tomorrow), it’s not a common feature of local conversation here. Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, told me: In South Africa, there has been very little of the climate denialist narrative you still see in the US and elsewhere. The South African government has been vocal in its commitment to the fight against climate change for many years, and there is a genuine popular understanding of the problem and consequences of climate change. One reason for that is that ordinary people can already see the effects of climate change very clearly. The devastating drought that has plagued South Africa for the past two years, with ruinous knock-on effects on the rural economy and food prices, is a very real and tangible reminder of our vulnerability to climate change. We really are at the coalface of climate change, so to speak. I’ve been talking to Johannes Wedenig, country representative for Unicef in Malawi about the situation there. He says climate change is making the weather hotter and more variable. From 2000 to 2009 droughts effected 8.5 million people in Malawi, and floods affected 1.2 million. From 2010 to 2016 we have already reached 8.4 million people affected by drought and 875,000 by flooding. So we will see at least a third more over the decade if the trend continues. But I’ve seen from my own experience that it’s the variability of weather phenomena that poses the greatest challenges to farmers in Malawi, especially when combined with an already fragile situation. People are selling their last assets and so are going into the next cycle even poorer, and unpredictability makes it very hard to plan and adapt. Wedenig says these changes affect the poor disproportionately. I’ve travelled widely in Africa but when I got here last year I was really shocked by the amount of acutely malnourished children. You wouldn’t necessarily expect to see such a severe impact here but Malawi shows the impact of climate change compounded by other factors such as soil degradation, population pressure and an over-reliance on a single crop (food source) as a result of past policy decisions. My colleague John Vidal was in Malawi at the end of last year, and wrote movingly about the food shortages there. Here is his piece. In east Africa, concerns are growing that the continent’s second highest peak, Mt Kenya, could be totally ice free within decades. The United Nations Environmental Programme estimates that 80% of East Africa’s glaciers have been lost since 1900. Mt Kenya has lost 92% of its glacial clover over the last century. Scientists are divided over the precise causes of the steady retreat of the glaciers but many blame rising temperatures driven by climate change. The consequences have been dire for locals. Glacial melt is one of the contributors to river flow in the region and many rivers have been drying up in recent years. Seven million people depend on agriculture fed by the vital Mt Kenya water catchment area, which provides the bulk of the tea and coffee exports that are critical to Kenya’s economy. The area also hosts heavily visited national parks and reserves. Although Africa has made a negligible contribution to the greenhouse emissions that cause climate change, many parts of the continent are expected to bear a great burden from the results of climate change. Mathenge wa Iregi, who as a Gikuyu elder has spent many years offering prayers in the forests of Mt Kenya, says he does not need scientists to point out the dramatic changes upending people’s lives and considers the stance of climate-change skeptics like US president-elect Donald Trump baffling. You just need to open your eyes. Mt Kenya was once a striking and impressive site and we even named it in reference to the glacial cover. Everything has changed within our lifetime. And that is simply because we human beings do not respect nature. Guardian columnist George Monbiot is writing today on Trump and climate change. This is his stark take on things: Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. You can read his full piece here. Here are three more tips on how to save the planet from author Chris Goodall of Carbon Commentary: Old gas and oil boilers can be hugely wasteful. Even if your current boiler is working well, it’s worth thinking about a replacement if it is more than 15 years old. Your fuel use may fall by a third or more, repaying the cost in lower fuel bills. The distance you drive matters. Reducing the mileage of the average new car from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year will save more than a tonne of CO2, about 15% of the average person’s footprint. If car travel is vital, think about leasing an electric vehicle when your existing car comes to the end of its life. A battery car will save you money on fuel, particularly if you drive tens of thousands of miles a year. Even though the electricity to charge your car will be partly generated in a gas or coal power station, electric vehicles are so much more efficient that total CO2 emissions will fall. But bear in mind that the manufacture of an electric car may produce more emissions than the vehicle produces in its lifetime. Rather than buying a new electric vehicle, it may be better to keep your old car on the road by maintaining it properly and using it sparingly. The same is true for many other desirable items; the energy needed to make a new computer or phone is many times the amount used to power it over its lifetime. Apple says 80% of the carbon footprint of a new laptop comes from manufacturing and distribution, not use in the home. Further west, the contraction of Lake Chad over the past four decades has created a very different set of problems for surrounding countries, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Some experts even blame the rise of Boko Haram on the disruption to traditional ways of life that the changing landscape has brought about. These maps show just how the lake has diminished over the decades: Patrick Kingsley visited the region for the Guardian at the end of last year, and found locals blaming the climate as much as the insurgents for the catastrophe that had befallen them. If the Lake Chad water was normal all these problems [with Boko Haram] would be eliminated economically, because nobody would have time to do all these things,” said Modu Amsami, a displaced person from northeast Nigeria You can read Patrick’s piece here. Our Egypt correspondent Ruth Michaelson has been to Alexandria to investigate the impact of rising sea levels on the city. Ruth writes: On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings. The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them. Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change. She visited the small town of Rosetta – famous for the stone – and found locals struggling to adapt to the unignorable advances of the sea. You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” a local fisherman, Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, told her. “Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives. If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk. You can read Ruth’s piece full piece here. We’re delighted to be working with both Tumblr and Univision today. For a version of this blog in Spanish, check out Univision’s work here. And to contribute to Tumblr’s unique exercise in creating a sort of “climate change quilt”, follow this link. We’re also on Twitter, using #globalwarning as a hashtag ... Right, that’s the introductions done. Later we’ll focus on climate change in the UK and Europe, but before that we’ll turn the focus to a part of the world where climate change is having one of the greatest impacts: Africa. Before we go any further, let’s look at how climate change is actually impacting parts of the world. Run the slider across to see how Arctic temperatures have changed over the past 40 years This one shows the dramatic decline of Lake Chad in west Africa, which has been blamed for large scale migration. And finally, the gradual melt of the ice sheet in Greenland. Carbon expert Chris Goodall says individual actions DO make a difference. Here are three of his suggestions for individual action that will cumulatively make a real impact on humankind’s carbon emissions: 1 Air travel is usually the largest component of the carbon footprint of frequent flyers. A single return flight from London to New York – including the complicated effects on the high atmosphere – contributes to almost a quarter of the average person’s annual emissions. The easiest way to make a big difference is to go by train or not take as many flights. 2 The second most important lifestyle change is to eat less meat, with particular emphasis on meals containing beef and lamb. Cow and sheep emit large quantities of methane, a powerful global warming gas. A vegan diet might make as much as a 20% difference to your overall carbon impact but simply cutting out beef will deliver a significant benefit on its own. 3 Home heating is next. Poorly insulated housing requires large quantities of energy to heat. If you have properly insulated the loft and filled the cavity wall, the most important action you can take is to draft-proof the house, something you can do yourself. Those with solid brick or stone walls will also benefit from adding insulation, but the financial benefits are unlikely to cover the cost of doing the work, over time. First things first – the facts. I know this is the post-fact era, and it’s become rather unfashionable to grub around looking for the truth. But here goes anyway: 1) Warming is happening fast. No doubt about it. For most of the 20th century, average global temperatures bimbled around the 13.5C mark. Now they are closer to 15C. The UK’s Met Office has produced a nice visual of this which really brings home how static temperatures were for a long period, before the past 20 years or so: 2) Scientists agree we are doing this to ourselves. Often good journalism involves balancing arguments. If you quote a Democrat, you need a Republican for balance. If you quote someone in favour of chocolate biscuits, you want a counter view. This has leached into climate journalism, but the vast majority of scientists support the hypothesis that manmade action is contributing to climate change. As this chart makes clear, if we want to strike a fair balance of voices in reporting climate change, we need to speak to more than 30 people who believe in manmade climate change before we give a platform to a sceptic. So we will do that today. We will hear from 30 or so people in the former camp. And we will remind you of what the world’s most famous climate sceptic, Donald Trump, has said. 3) BUT … THERE IS HOPE. There are many great things going on. We’re going to hear lots about these too: what is happening right now, and what you can do to join the global movement. Carbon emissions are flatlining (but need to start falling). Renewable capacity has increased exponentially around the world. In an article we have just published, climate expert Chris Goodall writes: 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. Humanity stands at a fork in the road, with one route descending towards disaster and the other climbing towards a brighter future. The route taken depends on whether the world can tame global warming, which threatens a violent end to the mild and stable climate the world has enjoyed since the start of civilisation. Many fear the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US president on Friday threatens to push us down the dark path. That’s understandable: he has called global warming a hoax and appointed climate-change deniers and oil barons to key posts. But the unpredictable Trump and his team have already stepped back from a threat to abandon the global climate deal agreed in Paris in 2015. Hope remains – just – that with the right advice and pressure, Trump may see the challenge of climate change as the great opportunity it also represents. Beating climate change requires nothing less than rewiring the global economy to run on zero-carbon energy – work that must start now but will take decades. As the climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern tells the Guardian: “The urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood.” But this titanic challenge also offers extraordinary opportunities: trillion dollar markets for green technology and the prospect of a clean, sustainable and fair world. The US is the most vibrant crucible for new technology the world has seen and embracing the transformation to a green economy would deliver jobs and prosperity to many Americans. Will Trump the dealmaker grasp the opportunity before Trump the climate-change denier throws it on a fossil fuel bonfire? Grabbing the chance would be a great way to “make America great again”, as many US cities, states and US businesses already realise. In contrast, not doing so will help make China great again, as its extraordinary transformation into a climate leader accelerates. Indeed the rest of the world’s nations have shown they remain resolute in pushing on, with or without the US. Even Saudi Arabia, which for years frustrated global climate talks, is now backing the renewables revolution with billions. The prize of beating climate change is a glittering one and still just within reach. Global carbon emissions have levelled off. But that only means we are no longer accelerating towards the climate cliff edge – just speeding along at a steady 100mph towards the “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” projected by the world’s scientists. A foretaste of those severe weather impacts has already arrived in many places, via scorching heatwaves and floods made far more likely by the overheating planet. To avoid climate breakdown, emissions must fall to zero in a few decades at most and that means ramping up action right now. Given the scale of the challenge, people can feel powerless to make a difference. But ask the key players around the world what individuals can do and one answer recurs more than cutting down on flying, giving up meat and saving energy: demand action from your elected representatives today. Hello and welcome to this live climate change special, in which we will be reporting from all seven continents on the climate change already underway – and the promise of solutions – in one 24-hour period. The plan is this: starting in London, we will generally follow the sun as daybreak falls around the world. We’ll be in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for the next few hours before crossing the Atlantic to look at the Americas during their morning. And finally we’ll move down to Sydney to hear about Asia-Pacific as that part of the world wakes up on Friday morning. All building towards Donald Trump’s big moment in Washington later in the day. We’re teaming up with social network Tumblr and Spanish-language US broadcaster Univision to cast the conversational net far and wide. Of course, Trump is on record as questioning the science behind climate change, and the link between the warming planet and the transformation of our weather patterns. But we’ll hear from people who, unlike Trump, live on the front line of climate change –in Bangladesh, Egypt, Canada, Bolivia, Malawi, the South Pacific – parts of the world where climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word) are few and far between. Already today we have heard from more than a dozen top global warming experts who pinpoint why Trump’s revisionism is not just dangerous but a self-inflicted wound. And we have heard Xi Jinping, China’s president, wax lyrical about the urgency of the moment: There is only one Earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland ... It’s not all gloom though. There’s a tremendous amount of work – science, innovation, activism and diplomacy – that should give readers hope. We’ll be highlighting the saviour technology that can yet make a big difference and the little things you can do in your life to join the climate movement. Other highlights will include a quiz, a doomsday carbon countdown clock, a Facebook live attempt to sketch climate change, and a film from the bottom of the earth. Our icons will indicate what each post is about, whether it’s drought, heat, oceans, flooding, food or ice melt – or just advice or commentary. So drop in from time to time, and see how we’re getting on. After all, in the time it’s taken you to read this, we’ve churned out another 100,000 tons of carbon. Next up will be Damian Carrington our head of environment, on why this is such a critical juncture for our species, and indeed every species on this planet.

The 25-year-old vessel, Pacific Pintail, has been brought back into service to make dozens of international shipments between nuclear plants over the next three years. Last month it moved three kilograms of plutonium under armed guard from Sweden to the US. The Pintail was laid up at Barrow in Cumbria two years ago for decommissioning, but has been resurrected after a £44m plan to build a new nuclear cargo ship was abandoned as too expensive. An internal report seen by the Guardian admits that the continued use of the old ship \"will present some PR difficulties\". But the problems could be managed, the report said, by preparing a \"stakeholder communications plan\" and by giving the boat a new name. It has subsequently been renamed the Oceanic Pintail. The report was drawn up in November 2010 by International Nuclear Services, a company owned by the government's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. It says that British nuclear cargo vessels \"have traditionally been retired from service before their 25th birthdays\".. But it proposed extending the life of the Pintail, which turns 25 this year, until at least 2015. This is an \"interim solution\" and \"a low-cost opportunity\", it said. The ship will be used to take multiple cargoes of radioactive waste from the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria to countries in Europe. There are plans for a series of other international shipments, though details have been kept secret. The INS report also discloses doubts over the continued use of another nuclear cargo ship, Atlantic Osprey, which is 26 years old. Keeping the ship in service \"presents difficulties\", it says, because the French nuclear safety authority, ASN, has \"reservations\" and because of \"reduced public acceptance/political credibility\". But the Osprey is still currently scheduled to ship mixed plutonium and uranium oxide (Mox) fuel from Sellafield to Germany for use in the Grohnde nuclear power plant in Lower Saxony. The shipment has been postponed from last year because of Mox manufacturing delays. INS has been accused by anti-nuclear campaigners of keeping both boats in service beyond their sell-by dates. Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment are demanding that the Pintail be scrapped and the Osprey shipment be cancelled. The continued use of the Pintail is a \"stopgap\" and \"cheapskate option\", according to Core's Martin Forwood. \"This seriously compromises the safety of nuclear shipments and poses significant risks to the marine environment and communities along transport routes,\" he said. INS is playing \"fast and loose\" with maritime safety by putting business needs first, he added. The internal INS report was released to Core in response to a request under freedom of information law. INS confirmed that the Pintail has been brought back into service, and that the Osprey is due to make a shipment to Germany. But the company insisted that it is \"categorically untrue\" to say that safety had been compromised. The Pintail has a \"flawless safety record\", said Ben Todd, an INS spokesman. It is quite capable of operating safely for longer than 25 years and its operations are independently regulated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The ship has been renamed because its owners and area of operation have changed, Todd added. The Osprey is also \"fully approved and certified to make Mox shipments\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/19/carbon-capture-uk-study-doubts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-19T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Carbon capture in UK under threat as study raises doubts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/19/carbon-capture-uk-study-doubts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/19/carbon-capture-uk-study-doubts","fields":{"headline":"Carbon capture in UK under threat as study raises doubts","bodyText":"Serious doubts have been raised over the prospects for carbon capture and storage in the UK in the first comprehensive investigation into the technology, just two weeks after the government launched a £1bn competition to build the first demonstration CCS plant. The finding by the government-funded UK Energy Research Council endangers many of the government's assumptions on tackling climate change, because ministers' long-term plans rely heavily on making the untried technique work on a massive scale. CCS is designed to lower the carbon emissions of fossil fuel power stations. The design of the new competition is flawed, and the UK is already falling far behind other countries such as the US in its attempts to commercialise the expensive technique, according to the lead author of the study, which took two years to compile. The technique has never been demonstrated at scale on a working power station. Jim Watson, lead author of the report, said: \"People assumed that CCS would be straightforward, but it has not been. It is a particularly challenging technology – it's actually very, very difficult.\" The question of the future of CCS is a crucial one because all of the government's assumptions about how the UK can meet its long term target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050 require a massive use of CCS technology. If it cannot be made to work commercially, and at a reasonable cost, then the UK would have to spend much more on renewable energy, nuclear power and other economic transformations, and would face having to make enormous cuts in areas such as emissions from air travel. Watson said he would give the UK \"a low grade\" for its efforts so far on CCS, and pointed to potentially disastrous flaws in the way the government is attempting to revive commercial interest in the technology. These rest on the long-term support for the technology, which when added to fossil fuel power stations will make them far more expensive to run. But the government wants companies to come up with proposals for building such plants within the coming weeks and months, while there is little chance of ministers outlining their long term funding ideas – which form part of the government's sweeping plans for electricity market reform – until next year at the earliest. This puts companies in a quandary, as they cannot put together adequate business plans without sight of ministers' long term funding proposals. Long delays have already plagued attempts to get CCS off the ground in the UK. The Treasury's initial plan for companies and consortiums to compete for a £1bn funding pot for a first demonstration plant was set out more than five years ago – but late last year it collapsed when the final potential entrant withdrew. On 3 April, ministers unveiled a new competition. \"The relaunch said all the right things about what to do, but there is a big question over the finance package,\" explained Watson. Offering to pay for some of the upfront costs of building such a plant – likely to cost well over £1bn – is not sufficient to attract companies, which will face the high costs of running such a plant for more than 20 years. \"When I talked to utilities, they were very sceptical – they need to make investment decisions, but all the pieces are not there,\" said Watson. \"I've been very surprised also about how little detail there has been from the government on electricity market reform. If I were a developer, I would like more information.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2012/jun/01/final-frontier-starship-enterprise-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-01T15:50:45Z","webTitle":"The final frontier?

Trillion-dollar plan to build Starship Enterprise","bodyText":"In its time, the original Star Trek series has inspired many inventions – the flip-open mobile phone (based on the crew's communicators), handheld medical diagnostics (based on its tricorder) – but now an engineer of 30 years standing says we should go the whole way and build the Starship Enterprise. The cost? A trillion dollars (£648bn) – but if spread over 20 years, argues \"Dan\", who has proposed the idea, it would cost only 0.27% of the US's gross domestic product, or about half what the Apollo project did in the 1960s. \"Just look how many young people were inspired to study engineering by the character Scotty from Star Trek,\" he writes on the website buildtheenterprise.org, which was set up to push the idea. \"Well, I bet a lot of young people would be inspired if we actually built the first generation of /Scotty's ship/.\" \"Dan\" admits that it won't actually be the dilithium-powered warp-driven faster-than-light photon torpedo-bearing galaxy-class starship piloted by Captain James T Kirk. He writes: \"The Star Trek adventures in the NCC-1701-x Enterprise ships take place starting in the year 2245. Our technology today is just not up to building a starship; that will have to wait for a Gen4 ship or later.\" But he does think that we could still build an interesting and useful spaceship that would be just as large as the fictional one, but with some differences. It would have a 1.5 gigawatt nuclear power plant rather than dilithium crystals; artificial gravity in its saucer-shaped crew quarters generated by rotating one part of it (rather as in 2001: A Space Odyssey), and a contra-rotating ring to stabilise the ship, perhaps filled with water or propellant. The reason for his modest proposal – which would require budget trimmings in other parts of the US – is, he says, that there's too little that's inspiring about modern space projects such as the International Space Station, which has cost about $100bn. \"The average person is left wondering why we are spending billions of dollars to build and maintain these fragile habitats,\" he writes on the site. \"There is just not much inspiring about them, and they haven't mattered much for advancing science either. The ISS may cost over $100bn before its final days, and one must wonder what better space exploration projects could have been funded in its place. ''Aboard the ISS there is no gravity, living quarters are cramped, you sleep floating in space – even using the toilet is comical and primitive. We are still stuck in the 1960s in many ways when it comes to putting human beings into space.\" Instead, he thinks, \"As the second decade of the 21st century rolls along – isn't it time to expect something much grander for our human endeavours into space? Isn't it time for something that will truly inspire us again while at the same time definitively giving humanity a sustainable, permanent presence in space? \"America is an affluent nation with 27% of the world's GDP. We can afford to dream much bigger.\" Ambitious – but Peter Bond, editor of Jane's Space Systems and Industry, and a longtime advocate of more ambitious space programmes, thinks it won't fly politically: \"Nasa's current budget is about 0.1% of US GDP, so this would involve doubling or trebling that, and with America's political and budget situation I just don't think that's going to happen.\" Bond said that while \"it's a great, fun idea\", it would only be feasible if other countries could be persuaded to come aboard – as happened with the ISS. \"Maybe if they got China, India, the Japanese and everybody else on board they could afford it,\" he said. Which was, of course, another feature of the USS Enterprise as portrayed in the 1960s series – its mixture of races and nationalities. At the time it was surprising – but maybe it just suggests that the 23rd century will be as financially strapped as this one is turning out to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/jul/11/petrogras-deap-sea-oil-drilling-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-11T18:21:18Z","webTitle":"Government $1bn deal to controversial Petrobras deep-sea oil drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/11/petrogras-deap-sea-oil-drilling-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/jul/11/petrogras-deap-sea-oil-drilling-funding","fields":{"headline":"Government $1bn deal to controversial Petrobras deep-sea oil drilling","bodyText":"The government has committed $1bn of taxpayer's funds to support deep-sea drilling in the south Atlantic, despite acknowledging that the controversial project has \"significant potential\" to damage the environment. Vince Cable's export credit guarantee department (ECGD) has agreed a $1bn (£637m) line of credit to help Brazil's state-owned oil company, Petrobras, drill for oil and gas. This will be in deeper water than the area in the Gulf of Mexico where an explosion on BP's Deepwater Horizon rig led to 11 deaths and US's the worst environmental disaster two years ago. The funding agreement, revealed in the ECGD's annual report, comes despite the department's own advisers warning that fresh oil and gas drilling off the coast of Brazil could lead to a marine catastrophe. The government's experts warned there are \"significant potential adverse environmental impacts anticipated, including beyond site boundaries\". Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP and chair of a parliamentary inquiry into the ECGD, which the Department for Business has renamed UK Export Finance (UKEF), said: \"It is a cause of real concern that, despite the coalition commitment to end all export finance for dirty fossil fuels, particularly the risky Atlantic oil drilling, UKEF still funds so many fossil-fuel-related projects and has so far failed to support a single green energy project.\" UKEF, which has been dubbed the \"department for dodgy deals\" by the Jubilee Debt Campaign, is designed to help British companies obtain insurance and credit to help them export goods overseas when traditional lenders may be afraid to provide financing. But the government was unable to name any British companies that would benefit from the $1bn credit line supplied to Petrobras. A spokesman for the business department said: \"At the time the annual report was published, no exports had been supported under the line of credit. UKEF hopes to be able to announce the first exports supported shortly.\" It is expected that FTSE 100 exploration company BG Group is likely to be one of the main British beneficiaries of the credit line. BG has placed ultra-deepwater drilling off the coast of Brazil at the heart of its ambitious strategy and it is actively developing many sites in partnership with Petrobras. A BG spokesman said the company had not yet received any UKEF financing for its projects in Brazil. Petrobras, which is controlled by the Brazilian government, is in the midst of a $236.5bn investment plan to exploit the untapped oil and gas reserves in the south Atlantic. The company, which made profits of 77bn reais (£24bn) last year, hopes the new wells will help lift its production to 5.7m barrels a day by 2020. The funding for Petrobras's drilling was one of several environmentally questionable global projects that UKEF helped get off the ground last year. While the Petrobras deal was assessed by environmental experts, several funding deals were cleared without any safety checks, including £6m for a Chinese nuclear power plant, £6m for a petrochemical plant in Azerbaijan, £6m for a gas plant in Nigeria and £13.5m towards two Russian coal mines. Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \"Whenever the UK government backs loans for exports, it should be assessing what impact those exports will have. Yet Vince Cable is supporting potentially damaging projects such as coal mines and methanol plants without his department showing any interest in how the money and exports will be used.\" Ruth Davis, chief policy adviser for Greenpeace UK, said: \"The government's energy policies are becoming a shambles. They've U-turned on their pledge to stop supporting dirty fossil fuel projects overseas, while undermining Britain's renewables industry through anti-green rhetoric and poorly designed energy market reform proposals. \"It's time David Cameron and Nick Clegg got a grip, and put their weight behind the low-carbon economy they both backed before the last election.\" The 2010 coalition agreement stated that UKEF would become a champion \"for British companies that develop and export innovative green technologies around the world, instead of supporting investment in dirty fossil fuel energy production\". A spokesman for the business department said: \"UK Export Finance applies all applicable OECD agreements that apply to the operation of export credit agencies. These include those that relate to potential environmental, social and human rights impacts. Details of how UK Export Finance will apply the coalition commitment … are expected to be announced by ministers in due course.\" The annual report also revealed that £1.8bn, or 79%, of the total £2.3bn of loans backed by UKEF in the 2010-11 financial year went to support Airbus. Other deals backed by the government included £680,000 for military vehicles in Turkey, £282,889 to help Libya buy British wallpaper and £504,000 worth of vodka packaging sent to Russia. A parliamentary inquiry is currently examining ways to radically change the ECGD, which has led to hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money being lent to help dictators build arsenals and facilitate environmental and human rights abuses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/16/green-deal-energy-efficiency-conservatory","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-16T12:26:00Z","webTitle":"Green deal plot reveals new levels of idiocy from Tory climate sceptics | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/16/green-deal-energy-efficiency-conservatory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/16/green-deal-energy-efficiency-conservatory","fields":{"headline":"Green deal plot reveals new levels of idiocy from Tory climate sceptics","bodyText":"Shooting oneself in the foot is dumb enough, but blowing both your legs off with a self-inflicted explosion of stupidity reveals a new level of idiocy.

How did it come to this? Mixing climate change scepticism with a terror of anything that smells of the \"nanny state\" produces a combustible brew, more than capable of incinerating common sense. The result is that Pickles and his Conservative MP conspirators want to discourage people living in cosier homes and paying lower energy bills, just as fuel poverty and energy bills are soaring. There are only two ways to make that add up. One is if you think climate change is not being caused by our relentless burning of fossil fuels, or that you don't think we need to worry about it. If this is your view - despite not a single government or science academy on Earth agreeing with you - then cutting energy use to cut carbon emissions would appear pointless. But what about saving money? The second way to make this lunacy add up is if you think the principle of the government butting out of your life is so valuable that ministers should just stand by and allow you to burn your own money (and the planet we share). It's hard to persuade those of the first view above to change their mind. They are a small minority in society and impervious to the evidence, but they are heavily over-represented among old, rightwing men, i.e the Conservative party. Yet its the second view which really stuns. Even confining ourselves to the narrow world of building regulations, we already submit ourselves to myriad rules to ensure we don't construct death traps. This costs money. The proposals from Pickles's department - to require those building extensions to spend about 10% of the total cost on energy efficiency measures - will save money. You can, if you like, take out a green deal loan for this, the repayments for which will be lower than the energy bill savings from day one. The cost argument is in fact even broader than this. Improving the energy efficiency of the country's old and leaky homes is by far the cheapest way to cut climate-warming carbon emissions, and cuts energy bills too. But if you hold your right to burn your own money so dear that you refuse to insulate your home, then, with the nation legally bound to reduce its emissions, you're going to be paying for the more-expensive alternatives too. Perhaps you'd like your hard-earned pounds to go on a wind farm, a waste-to-energy incinerator or perhaps a new nuclear power station? Ultimately, it's about fairness, in my view. If you are one of the 200,000 a year who extend your home, then congratulations and I truly hope you enjoy your new room. But it is justified for me to expect you to make it energy efficient, otherwise I'm going to have to deal with your share of the nation's carbon reductions on top of my own. The challenge we face in energy and climate change is too great to indulge free riders, so here's a rallying cry even those on the right might - eventually - warm to: zero tolerance for carbon scroungers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/jan/20/lord-hunt-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-20T17:09:27Z","webTitle":"Live Q&A: Lord Hunt on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/20/lord-hunt-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/20/lord-hunt-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Live Q&A: Lord Hunt on nuclear power","bodyText":"What does a new generation of nuclear reactors mean for Britain? That's the question we'll be asking on Thursday 21 January when Lord Philip Hunt, minister of state at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, joins us from 12-1pm to answer your questions on new nuclear power. Writing in the Guardian last October, Hunt said: \"A nuclear renaissance in the UK presents a tremendous opportunity. It has the potential to supply us with substantial amounts of home-grown, low-carbon, reliable and relatively cheap energy.\" But how just how much new nuclear power does the UK need, where should the reactors be built, and how should we deal with problems of waste and public subsidy? Ten sites have been chosen for new reactors: Sizewell, Suffolk; Hartlepool, Cleveland; Heysham, Lancashire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Braystones, Cumbria; Kirksanton, Cumbria; Wylfa Peninsula, Anglesey; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Hinkley Point, Somerset, and Bradwell, Essex. And the government wants to hear what you think about those sites - it's undertaking a consultation on nuclear sites that closes on 22 February. Whatever you want to ask about nuclear power in the UK, just post your question below and Hunt will be here between 12 and 1pm on 21 January to answer as many of your questions as possible.

Germans are good at saving water, so good in fact that they have created a problem for their canalisation system: many pipes are clogged with grease, excrement and leftovers because they aren't being flushed sufficiently with water. Especially in the summer, gutters in German cities can reek horribly. In some parts of the country, water suppliers even have to flush their pipes artificially with hundreds of thousands of litres of water. We Germans have always been keen to be best in class when it comes to saving water. Our toilets have a special water-saver button for flushing after you have a wee, we switch off the tap when we brush our teeth, we try hard not to splash too much when we wash our cars. Last year Germany only used 124 litres of water per head per day – down from 144 litres in 1991. In Britain the current figure is 150 litres. That might be very impressive on Germany's part, and shaming on Britain. But the real question is whether small gestures like that really make a difference. In the long run, the few drops you save when drinking, cooking, flushing or washing up are of little importance. It is products, not activities that waste most water. Making a a 200g bag of crisps uses 135 litres, a beefburger 2,400 and a steak 4,000. A cotton T-shirt gulps up 4,100 litres, a brand new car as much as 450,000. Of course you can argue with the details here – there are always slightly greener alternatives. But you can't argue much with the so-called water footprint which shows how carelessly we treat Earth's most valuable resource. On average, every person on this planet is responsible for an incredible 1.4m litres of water usage per year: that's 8,600 bathtubs with 160 litres of water each. Ninety per cent of this is employed in agriculture: that's where proper water-conservation needs to happen. But apparently politicians care little to do anything about it, be it in London, Berlin or Brussels. It's quite possible that there will be more frequent drought warnings in the future. National governments will have to find ways of dealing with the problem. The first step might have to be a fight with the farmers, industrialists and lobbyists, and not just those on their doorstep. And there are plenty of proposals on the table that politicians should consider: be it a water tax, whereby those who used rivers to cool their factories will have to cough up, using agricultural subsidies as rewards for careful water usage, or a water limit across the industry. Instead, environment secretary Caroline Spelman seems to be focusing on telling ordinary people to have fewer baths. Her German counterparts, who pride themselves on their teacher's-pet reputation, are no better in that respect, by the way. Angela Merkel may have listened to environmentalist concerns once she realised that popular opinion in Germany was against nuclear power. But she doesn't look keen to boost her green credentials any further. It's the same across the globe: politicians like giving people the feeling that they are doing something good for the environment when they turn off their taps. But sadly that's not enough. In the long term, feel-good environmentalism won't save the planet. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/brain-flapping/2012/dec/13/moon-landings-faked-science-confessions","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-13T12:45:00Z","webTitle":"The moon landings were faked (and other science confessions)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/dec/13/moon-landings-faked-science-confessions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/dec/13/moon-landings-faked-science-confessions","fields":{"headline":"The moon landings were faked (and other science confessions)","bodyText":"Yesterday, Channel 5 screened a documentary (and I use that term so loosely it essentially qualifies as a liquid) called \"Did we land on the moon?\", which looked at the arguments for the well-established conspiracy theory that the moon landings, that defining achievement that inspired generations and showed the true potential of humanity, was an elaborate sham. The programme caused a lot of anger among the science community on the social networks, and arguably rightly so. The programme portrayed the conspiracy theorists as having legitimate arguments and unanswered questions that support their claims, making scant effort to show dissenting views or counterarguments from people who have the audacity to be qualified to discuss the matter. In a way, this is actually the fault of the science community. We've been complaining about the media distorting science via their obsession with presenting a balanced argument for some time now. We should probably have specified that when we argued that balance is unnecessary, we didn't mean \"drop the actual science\". Whatever you say about programmes like this, they're not balanced, so we can't complain on that front. But giving such a high-profile media platform to the conspiracy theorists and letting them go unchallenged is a very dangerous move; it infers undeserved credibility to their claims, meaning more people take them seriously. It would be like inviting David Icke onto Question Time, or having Stephen Green of Christian Voice on as the main guest to discuss the significance of the discovery of the Higgs Boson. That last one actually happened, by the way, on a BBC Radio Wales phone in. I know this because I was invited to be on the show too, but refused once I found who I'd be sharing airtime with. I'm happy to be \"token science guy\" at times, but I'm not letting what little credibility I have get sullied further by having to speak to that guy as if his views should be taken seriously. Interestingly, on that same programme they had a moon landing denier on to explain why the moon landing, and by association science in general, is a big con. And thus this article gets back on track. Despite the fact that the moon landing conspiracy has been debunked many many many times, it endures. I've had a number of discussions with conspiracy theorists myself, as you may have guessed. For example, I've been told that the moon landings were faked as a publicity stunt. \"If the moon landing was real, why didn't they go back?\" is one argument used. And apart from the further five times they went back, that's a fair point. Those other ones were probably publicity stunts too, but they kept those quiet. \"It was a scam to get one over on the Russians\" is another argument I've heard. Another good point, the USSR and USA were involved in a space race, so the USA decided to cheat to get to the moon first. Sure, the USSR could have disproved their claims if they'd wanted, but they clearly trusted the Americans not to lie. They may have been willing to wipe out the planet over their ideological differences, but when it came to important stuff like space-based contests, they trusted the Americans implicitly. So why, if the evidence is so damning, does the moon landing conspiracy endure? Well, it's gone on long enough, someone has to finally come clean, and I guess I'm the only one who feels the public has a right to know. Yes, the moon landings were faked. You can take my word on this, I'm a scientist. A scientist who wasn't even born at the time and who has no official connection to space travel or any space-based discipline, but you know us scientists, we're all in on it together. Yes, the moon landings were faked. Even more fake than you know. Never mind the secret studios in warehouses or what have you, the whole moon landing saga was just realistic CGI. That's right, all the footage you've seen of the supposed moon landing is entirely computer animated. The USA had access to computer technology decades ahead of what was normal in the 1960s in order to do this. But, you may say, if that was the case, why wouldn't they use their massive technical advantage to dominate everyone else on the planet economically, militarily and in every other way, rather than piss about concocting an elaborate moon landing façade? Because that wouldn't have been fair to everyone, and if there's one thing you can be sure about the US government of the 60s and 70s, they were unerringly honest about their dealings, give or take the occasional massive conspiracy. The thing is, it doesn't stop there. Revelations rarely happen in isolation, so now that I've let the cat out of the bag with regards to the moon landings, it's only a matter of time before the true extent of the deceptions carried out by the scientific community come to light. So, in the interests of transparency, here are some other conspiracies and outright lies that science has been feeding people. THE HIGGS BOSON = The Higgs Boson isn't a real thing, I'm afraid. It doesn't even sound like a real thing. A \"boson\" is a member of a ship's crew, isn't it? The whole thing was concocted as a ruse to build the Large Hadron collider, which is actually a cover for the world's biggest go-kart track, something that would never have got funding on its own merits. If we're being honest about particle physics, the atom as is commonly portrayed doesn't exist either. There are actually only four known elements, \"Earth\", \"Wind\", \"Fire\" and \"September\". Nuclear power is actually the name given for when there is a higher density of fire in one place than normal. VACCINATION = Although rational types have been decrying antivaxxers for years, unfortunately they are correct. Vaccinations are unnecessary; they're a cover for the true nature of disease. It was discovered long ago that all diseases were actually spread by the Dodo. Upon this realisation, scientists decided to initiate a brutal extermination campaign, which lead to their apparent extinction. However, racked by guilt over their actions, the science community concocted the whole vaccine story to explain why people weren't getting so sick anymore, and have persevered with it to this day. Dodos actually still exist, but in real life they closely resemble pigeons. The story about them being extinct was made up to prevent panic, and the image of the dodo as a large bemused chicken is based on a model created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, commissioned to back up the story. RELATIVITY = The theory of relativity is, as many have guessed, made up. It doesn't make any sense when you think about it, time slowing down as you go faster? Gaining mass as you approach light speed? It's all based on an incident Einstein experienced when on a particularly long train journey where his watch was broken and he went to the buffet car a few too many times. He came up with relativity as an excuse for why he was late and bloated, and the other physicists just went with it. By the time it was discovered what had happened, Einstein was the most famous physicist around and they kept it going rather than risk undermining their most respected scholar. THE WORLD IS ROUND = It isn't I'm afraid. It's flat. But it's not static, the land is constantly moving across it like a supermarket conveyer belt. Hence we get night and day, night is when the belt is on the underside of the Earth. This also explains why some long-haul flights take less time on the way back than the way there or vice versa. Planes are either going the opposite way to the direction of travel of the belt, or trying to accelerate in the same direction, which takes longer. SCHRODINGER'S CAT = It was actually a ferret, but 'Schrodinger's ferret' just sounds wrong. And a little bit rude. Also, it was dead. GENERAL ANAESTHETICS = These don't actually do anything, they're a money-making scam by pharmaceutical companies. People undergoing surgery fall asleep of their own accord as operating theatres and surgeons are kept as boring as possible. There are many more I could tell you, but that will do for now. You may think these claims are ridiculous and so farfetched they couldn't possibly be true. Yeah, people used to say that about the moon landing conspiracy theories.

The passage of the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 through the Senate paves the way for a highly controversial plan to store nuclear waste in Muckaty Station, a remote Aboriginal community in the arid central region of the Northern Territory. The ruling Labor party received support from the conservative coalition opposition to approve the bill, despite an ongoing federal court case over the legality of using the Muckaty site to store radioactive material. Currently, nuclear waste from the medical and mining industries is stored in more than 100 \"temporary\" sites in universities, hospitals, offices and laboratories across Australia. Anti-nuclear protesters disrupted proceedings in the Senate as the legislation was debated earlier on Tuesday, with the group heckling lawmakers from the public gallery over their support for the bill. A recent medical study warned that transporting nuclear waste over long distances to such an isolated location, which is 75 miles north of the Tennant Creek township, could endanger public health. \"The site is in an earthquake zone, it floods regularly, there are very long transport corridors, there are no jobs being applied and it's opposed from people on the ground, on the front line from Tennant (Creek) all the way up to the NT government and people around the country,\" said senator Scott Ludlam of the Greens, which successfully added an amendment to the bill that bans the importing of foreign nuclear waste to the site. Aboriginal groups launched legal action after claiming that traditional owners of the land around Muckaty do not approve of the dump, despite the government maintaining that the local Ngapa indigenous community supports the plan. Under Australian Native Title law, indigenous groups recognised as the traditional owners of land must be consulted and compensated for any major new infrastructure. Although the Australian government insists that it has not decided on a site for the dump, Muckaty is the only option under consideration and the Northern Territory government has already been offered AUS$10m if it accepts the facility. Finding a location for a national nuclear waste dump has proved a major headache for successive Australian governments, with former prime minister John Howard rebuffed in his attempt to situate the facility in South Australia in 2004. The Northern Territory government has complained that it is being strong-armed into taking the dump due to it being a \"constitutional weak link\" and not having the same rights as full Australian states. Nuclear power remains a highly contentious issue in Australia, which, despite having the largest uranium deposits in the world, has steadfastly refused to shift its largely coal-fired energy generation to nuclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/dec/05/autumn-statement-2012-expert-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-05T14:51:00Z","webTitle":"Autumn statement 2012: expert verdict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/05/autumn-statement-2012-expert-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/05/autumn-statement-2012-expert-verdict","fields":{"headline":"Autumn statement 2012: expert verdict","bodyText":"Richard Murphy: The little people will still pay the taxes George Osborne has spoken. But what he said on tax will disappoint most people who listened. He says he will invest £77m for the next two years in the fight against tax avoidance. Actually, all that means is he will slow the rate of cuts at HMRC, which in reality is still suffering many thousands of job cuts a year. He says will raise £10bn from tackling tax avoidance. But £5bn of that is from the already legislated UK-Swiss tax agreement, the German equivalent of which has been rejected by its parliament as it is too kind to tax cheats and criminals. The rest of his claim looks decidedly optimistic. And he says he will tax the rich, but he won't. He will be taxing those on high incomes a little more by cutting their pension allowances. They lose £1bn as a result. Those on benefits lose £3.7bn though. And the unemployed get no benefit from an increase in the personal allowance. Amazingly, large business – the sector subject to most criticism of late – gets a tax cut worth more than £1bn. Small business will now in many cases be taxed at higher rates. And as for the General Anti-Abuse Rule he trumpeted so loudly, it is designed to go nowhere near what he calls normal commercial tax planning. That means Starbucks, Google, Amazon and all their friends can carry on, quite unimpeded. In the spring budget Osborne tried action on tax and failed to deliver. This time he's trying inaction on tax hidden behind a barrage of Treasury press releases. The net result will be the same: the cheats will still cheat and the little people will still pay the taxes. • Richard Murphy is an adviser to the Tax Justice Network Dominic Raab: Should retain market confidence – for now Three points stand out from this \"fiscally neutral\" mini-budget that found some extra savings to plough back into the economy. First, the official target of having debt falling by 2015/16 will be delayed a year. The target matters less than current UK net government debt, which at 84% (on the IMF's count) is still precarious. IMF and Harvard studies show that when national debt hits 90% of GDP, there is a tipping point where long-term structural growth is severely damaged. George Osborne's approach should retain market confidence – and keep interest rates low – for now, but we remain too close for comfort to the debt danger zone. Second, the chancellor found leeway to cancel the planned rise in fuel duty, increase the income tax personal allowance to help those on low incomes, and cut corporation tax further to spur jobs growth. This is welcome relief rather than a major stimulus package. Third, the devil will be in the detail, but plans to exploit shale gas – along with new nuclear power stations – mark an important shift away from inflating consumer energy bills by gambling on existing inefficient and expensive renewable technologies, and towards an environmental policy that makes wider economic sense. • Dominic Raab is the Conservative MP for Esher &amp; Walton Ann Pettifor: Shows the defeatism of Britain's political class The most striking thing about today's mis-named \"autumn statement\" is what it tells us about the defeatism of Britain's political class in the face of the nation's deepest and most prolonged depression. Roosevelt, faced by a comparable depression, told his people in 1933 that they had nothing to fear but fear itself. Britain's chancellor chooses instead, to fill his people with fear and depression. Economic activity continues to collapse – that is why corporate tax receipts fell so precipitously in October. And this is wrongly presented to the nation as inevitable, as a \"permanent\" loss. Not true. There is massive spare capacity. The Treasury's policy is not to utilise it. The chancellor is faced with a crater of economic inactivity – bombed out of the economy by the banking crisis and self-induced austerity. And into that crater – a loss of about £500bn from 2010-12 – he proposes to drop a pitiful £5bn. This is about 0.3% of a single year's GDP and consists of largely recycled capital investment. The British people deserve better. • Ann Pettifor is director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics Gavin Kelly: A bad day for Osborne and the poor It will be remembered not just as the day when the chancellor's fiscal goals were left in tatters but also as the moment when the mounting scale of post-2015 cuts became clearer – with more pain to come by 2018 on top of the roughly £23bn that was already pencilled in by 2017. Osborne's favoured political narrative (repeated by much of the media) that the poor and rich may have been raided but strivers have been helped, collides with the reality that working households on low incomes will be hit hard by year after year of real terms cuts to tax credits and benefits. Say and repeat: three-quarters of the families getting tax credits are in work. So-called strivers are being squeezed. The promised rabbit out of the hat turned out to be a tiny bunny – a bit more progress towards the £10k personal tax allowance. Welcome news, of course, for those who gain but it's remarkable that any money is being spent on those earning up to £100k at the same time as new cuts are being introduced that will fuel poverty. Expect a backlash to the decision to trim generous pension tax relief for the affluent. Ignore it. Though it in no way legitimises taking money off the poorest, this is defensible in its own terms. Compared with the budget, today was better executed by Osborne. But it was a bad day for him and, more importantly, for the poor – both working and non-working. • Gavin Kelly is chief executive of Resolution Foundation Prateek Buch: Penalising the very 'strivers' he seeks to help George Osborne's autumn statement and the accompanying OBR figures reveal three things clearly. First, the chancellor's below-inflation rises in benefits penalise the very \"strivers\" he seeks to help – welfare spending remains high because people cannot support themselves through insecure, low-paying work. This is unpalatable, especially while the economy continues to stagnate – it goes against Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander's promise not to balance the books on the backs of the poor. Second, measures to tackle tax avoidance and ensure well-off pensioners contribute are welcome in their own right, but are not a fair trade-off for larger cuts to working-age benefits and services. Clegg rightly shook his head as Osborne refused to tax property – he should have done more than that to ensure the wealthiest bear a greater burden. Moving further towards the Liberal Democrat aim of raising the income tax threshold to £10,000 is welcome. Third, while the extra capital spending and the requirement for Whitehall to bear its share of cuts are welcome, Osborne's insistence on disproportionately hitting the poorest is matched by his continued shocking record on green growth. We have seen too little in this statement to create the green jobs of the future that will raise living standards – continuing this discredited approach is not good enough. • Prateek Buch is director of the Social Liberal Forum Mark Serwotka: A laughable revival of 'all in this together' George Osborne buried his head in the sand today and buried any chance of economic recovery with his autumn statement. We saw the usual spectacle of the chancellor admitting he has failed with his deficit target, failed to meet his debt target and failed to grow the economy. This is exactly what we predicted would happen when we published our anti-austerity pamphlet There is an Alternative in 2010. We argued that we should boost capital expenditure to create jobs. Osborne's paltry extra £5bn is a drop in the ocean of what's needed, and comes at the expense – we estimate – of another 13,000 civil service jobs. Laughably, the chancellor also revived \"we're all in this together\". His justification for this discredited statement is a moderate cut in the tax reliefs going to high earners with good pension plans. However, he also announced today £14.2bn of welfare cuts on top of the \"£18bn a year\" already cut. And corporation tax is being cut again – benefiting wealthy shareholders and cutting revenue for public services. Of course the real scroungers are not those struggling to make ends meet on £10 per day (the current rate of jobseeker's allowance), but the wealthy landlords pocketing billions in housing benefit, and the low-paying employers who force millions into reliance on tax credits. And that's before you get to the tax dodgers that we will be targeting alongside UK Uncut this weekend. • Mark Serwotka is general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2013/jan/28/ex-compliance-officer-trader-voices-finance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-28T11:30:01Z","webTitle":"Ex-compliance officer: 'I had to tell the trader what to do – I had two minutes' | Joris Luyendijk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2013/jan/28/ex-compliance-officer-trader-voices-finance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2013/jan/28/ex-compliance-officer-trader-voices-finance","fields":{"headline":"Ex-compliance officer: 'I had to tell the trader what to do – I had two minutes'","bodyText":"He got in touch offering insights into \"compliance\" in financial firms as well as into \"algorithmic trading\". A philosophy as well as business school graduate, he worked in compliance for seven years in a bank and then a brokerage before switching to academia, with interests in the anthropology of finance. He is a modest yet self-assured man in his early 30s, from continental Europe. He orders a coffee. Please go here to leave a comment to which the interviewee will respond. \"A practical example. Three weeks into my job as compliance officer on the trading floor I am sitting at my desk. My three senior colleagues are in a meeting somewhere, I am manning the compliance desk on my own. It is 4.28pm Paris time, two minutes before the market closes. A program trader comes up to me and says a client of his wants to make a trade that is four times the size of all trades on the Irish market's index that day taken together. That's huge, obviously, and could very much look like market manipulation, so close to market-close, from a compliance/market supervisor's perspective. \"That's compliance for you. I had to tell the trader what to do, and my timeframe was two minutes. Oh, and I was still in my trial period, when you really don't want to make mistakes. So I tried to build an argument, and checked the boxes: was the client aware of the size of the order? Yes, confirmed the trader meaning he had done his 'duty of advice'. Was that conversation on a recorded line, for the event of an inquiry by the regulator? It was, said the trader. Then go on, I said because what reason could I give not to? \"While we were speaking it turned out that an equally big 'opposite trade' order came in, from another big fund manager. It transpired that they wanted to swap a very large volume of shares with one another, I believe for accounting reasons. It would be like you and me wanting to swap euros for pounds. We could do it directly, but then we have to agree on an exchange rate and there's no paper trail. The alternative is to swap through an official market. \"This was what the two big fund managers were doing, all completely legitimate and above board. Compliance in finance is often like this. Incomplete information under time pressure, with concerns often not becoming problems. \"My impression was that regulators were not always alive to how things work in practice. The ones I dealt with were often economists, essentially philosophers who had learned to build models. When you talk about practice to them, what they think of is statistics. \"You'd also have former bankers at the regulators, but their perspective seemed to be: 10 years in banking, two years at the regulator for experience, then quickly back into banking. \"You know when you fly to the US and they give you this ridiculous piece of green paper where you have to confirm you're not a terrorist? And you know it's only so that they are able to show you were lying if you actually turn out to be one? That's how regulation is seen; box tickers. \"It works differently on different trading floors. For instance, some companies might be happy to put compliance in a separate office. When I still was a trainee, I used to work for such a company in the City. I remember the first time my compliance boss took me to the trading floor. He opened the door and immediately a trader shouted: 'Compliance on deck.' The room just went dead quiet, instantly. Walking up to the door we had heard all the chatting and shouting. Now: silence. \"Compliance is an ambivalent function. On the one hand you are seen as the regulators' ally inside the investment firm; overseeing the implementation of their regulation. On the other hand, you are paid by the investment firm and part of their culture and hierarchy. You might say 'front office' (traders making the money) looks at compliance the way compliance in turn looks at the regulators. At one point one of our analysts had written an investors' note on a share that got caught up in a case of insider trading. The regulator wanted to speak to our analyst. It was my job then to prepare him. I sat him in a dark room with a lamp on his face, in a manner of speaking, and ask him all the questions likely to be put to him later, let him repeat his story until it checked out. \"I was working for the bank for four years, then for the brokerage for three years. Working in compliance in a bank and a brokerage has been excellent preparation for a career in academia. Writing my PhD dissertation about the activity, trying to put experience into perspective is both challenging and rewarding. You'd be surprised how many finance professors have never worked in the kind of bank or organisations that they teach about. To me it would be like speaking a language without ever having visited the country where it's spoken. \"On to the algorithmic or high frequency trading (HFT). First of all, what follows here is a brokerage perspective. \"Normally clients call their trader with an order, and traders go into the market to get the best possible price for their client. With algo-trading, traders feed their client's order into their computer which executes the trade. What this means is that the computer decides when actually to buy or sell, then doing it faster than any human being ever could. Also, it makes no mistakes. \"Trading happens so fast you can't have a box asking 'are you sure you want to buy X thousand of Y?'. You get 'fat finger syndrome', when a trader makes a mistake and buys the wrong amount, or sells rather than buys, or vice versa. That can be very expensive. \"There is algo/HFT by hedge funds and 'prop' traders, where an algorithm acts not only decides when to buy or sell, but also what to buy and sell. Then there's what I was exposed to, high frequency trading for flow purposes – a boring activity, from a prop trader's perspective. \"The effect of HFT on the trading floor is fascinating. You can't see the HFT programme, as it is embedded in the computers. So you notice it negatively, when traders complain because something isn't working. And you notice it when you're watching the order book on a screen, and you see movement when the programme buys or sells. \"It's when there's a panic that you really realise just how strange and evanescent these programmes are. How do we access them? In the last resort people can actually rip out the cable from the computer. I've seen that happen, but it seems ridiculously primitive in such technological environments. \"No human being could ever do what computers now do with high frequency trading. No human being can see what HFT does. We can only see it afterwards, when it already has made its impact. This raises important questions for regulators. HFT is very difficult to corset, to manage. Regulators will probably never have the manpower to monitor all the data, to follow all transactions. So a significant portion is delegated to innovative technology. Many people I have interviewed are genuinely concerned over this. \"Finance gets more and more intertwined with maths. If you look at leading publishers in the field such as Springer Verlag, 20 years ago they mostly put out collections of pure mathematics. These days it's all applied, and applied to finance. Back in the days maths was for nerds. Now you do maths and you can be rich. I come across personal ads for math wizards with coding skills ('IT quants') with base pay of €1m, and another million in guaranteed bonus. They are not ashamed to advertise that. \"The algo-trading programs have telling names. They are called 'sniper' (it looks into the order book, fires an order when it sees the prices it's told to get), 'guerilla', 'hunt' and 'dagger', all names metaphorically referring to a pattern of action. \"Algo-trading packages are sold to clients, and these name help the marketing and salespeople explain what the product is in the first place. Basically the names make real the programme's existence, providing an image of the underlying model. \"It's a fascinating field, finance. And citizens need to want to understand it. It's complex? Well, everything is complex. In that respect it's a great time for anthropologists. We desperately need more descriptions of what the hell is going on in all those niches in finance. Anthropologists can do that. I tell my colleagues in academia, if we still can't get heard in this crisis, we never will. \"As outsiders begin to understand better, maybe we'll get better thinking on risk, too. We must come to an acceptance that many things simply cannot be controlled so we shouldn't wish to even try. You can plan for an earthquake. You can plan for a tsunami. And you can plan for a nuclear power plant to have a meltdown. What you cannot plan for, not fundamentally, is for all these three things to happen in one swoop. \"What's more, you cannot have a banking environment that is risk free, gives high returns while being highly transparent. That's logically impossible. If you're transparent in what you're doing then others will see it and get in on the action driving down returns. \"Let me finish by saying that most of compliance is seen as quite boring. And it's probably partially true, for you are constantly making sure that documentation of everything being done in your firm is comprehensive. Post-crisis compliance seems to be emphasising such a trend. To me, however, and among the five tasks that compliance usually performs (translating new rules into procedures, training people by explaining the new rules to them, then monitoring, checking and controlling people, making sure for example that a stock analyst doesn't trade in the stocks he writes about. Then giving advice and finally doing a bit of lobbying, say, when the EU is about to introduce yet more regulation, and you need to defend your interests), the most important task of compliance should definitely be advice; that is being in a position to help finance practitioners making the shift from generic normative texts (rules) to specific practical contexts.\" • Please go here to leave a comment to which the interviewee will respond"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2012/jun/12/us-military-mini-drones-battlefield","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-12T18:43:06Z","webTitle":"US military using lightweight mini-drones launched from battlefield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/12/us-military-mini-drones-battlefield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/12/us-military-mini-drones-battlefield","fields":{"headline":"US military using lightweight mini-drones launched from battlefield","bodyText":"The US military has issued soldiers in Afghanistan with a new class of lightweight unmanned drone known as the Switchblade, which can be carried in a backpack and used on the battlefield in place of an air strike. The Switchblade, manufactured by the AeroVironment Corporation in Monrovia, California, weighs just under six pounds (2.7kg) and can be rapidly launched and sent over the nearest ridge to circle above the battlefield before being sent to zero in on the enemy – usually the chest or head of an enemy combatant. The weapon, which commanders have dubbed the \"Flying Shotgun\", has been widely tested by the US Army, US Marines and US Air Force. It has proved so effective that AeroVironment has announced more than US$14m (£9m) worth of Switchblade systems and related engineering contracts in the past 10 months. The increasing use of drones to target militants under the Obama administration has proved controversial as critics say assassinations conducted by drones amount to extrajudicial killing.Like larger Predator or Reaper drones, the unmanned Switchblade is flown by a \"pilot\" who monitors the flight from a video screen. The Switchblade can loiter above the target before being sent in to strike. It typically flies far lower than other drones, often less than 500ft above the ground and is highly manoeuvrable, allowing it to circle in on a fixed or fleeing target. The Switchblade is designed for use by small ground units who need to attack nearby targets – snipers on a ridge, rebels on a rooftop or an ambush the next ridge over. Defence analysts believe warfare in the future will see many more mini armed drones which are now called \"loitering munitions\" and provide ground troops with a view described as coming from \"the tip of the bullet\". However, arms control groups and peace activists see the new weaponry as at best controversial. Bruce Gagnon, the co-ordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space, said it would not be long before the drones were being used domestically. \"People are beginning to see that these technologies are going to be dual use – meaning over there and back here at home,\" he said. Like much of the drone war, the deployment of the Switchblade is kept secret. The US military refuses to acknowledge how many Switchblades are in stock, in which countries they are deployed or to which units they are being supplied. The only official acknowledgement came from an army general who last October admitted that \"less than a dozen\" Switchblades have been deployed. However, in a February 2010 solicitation for production specifications of these mini-drones for the US Army's Redstone Arsenal asked potential suppliers to provide the \"cost per system for quantities of 500, 2,000 and 20,000 units\". Following successful battlefield testing, the Switchblade has now been being distributed to conventional infantry troops including the 2nd Battalion of the 16th Infantry Unit based at Fort Riley, Kansas. Last month, members of the battalion spent a week practising the launch, flight and detonation of the drones. While drone strikes from fixed-wing aircraft have a chain of command that stretches from Afghanistan to the United States, with multiple steps to avoid civilian casualties or friendly fire casualties, these ultra-light, portable drones bring the decision to kill down to the level of platoon commander or even individual soldier. According to Gagnon, the advent of the small drone is another step in the military's bid to have battle fought by robots. \"We have been seeing this attempt by the military to essentially roboticize warfare. It gives them two very valuable results, it lessens the price, as a drone is much cheaper than an F-16, and secondly it takes increasingly less people on the battlefield. \"You still need a lot of people back home flying them and sitting in front of the computers,\" said Gagnon, \"but it puts less people in harm's way and the Pentagon is happy about this. It is easier to sell endless war when fewer GIs are coming home in bodybags.\" \"Technology is moving at lightning speed and policy is moving at glacial speed,\" said PW Singer, the author of Wired for War, a critical analysis of the military use of robotic technologies. \"This tech is proliferating, with more than 50 countries now building, buying and using military robotics. The cat is already out of the bag.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/11/energy-electricity-market-reform-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T10:48:00Z","webTitle":"Powering the UK: why the new electricity plan is all about nuclear | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/11/energy-electricity-market-reform-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/11/energy-electricity-market-reform-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Powering the UK: why the new electricity plan is all about nuclear","bodyText":"Energy in the 21st century is about three Cs: carbon, cost and continuity of supply. But the UK government's major reform of the country's electricity market, due to be published on Tuesday, is fundamentally about only one thing: new nuclear power. The plans are critically important. They represent a giant intervention in the UK's unusually free market and are intended to deliver the investment needed to meet the three Cs, that a free market would not provide. In other words, it's about keeping the lights on while cutting greenhouse gas emissions at a price that consumers can pay. The UK government decided long ago that new nuclear power stations are essential to deliver this. In the last few days I have spoken to people in the power industry, energy academics, investors and green campaigners. All agree that the sprawling and complex maze of measures the government proposed has the central aim of getting new nuclear power stations built. Essential background reading on this is an article by Professor Catherine Mitchell at Exeter University, which deftly leads you through labyrinth. I'll come to what to look out for in tomorrow's plan, but first I want to ask how the UK came to place such a big bet on nuclear? It started a decade ago, when the then Labour government opted for a 2010 renewable energy target of 10% (which was missed) instead of 20%, placing the emphasis instead on nuclear power. Government and the nuclear industry have been in each others pockets ever since, as shown by the shocking collusion to downplay the Fukushima disaster, just hours after it happened. Fast forward to this government and you have the unhappy coupling of the Conservative's pro-nuclear stance and the LibDem's once stern opposition. The mutant offspring of this was the pledge that new nuclear could go ahead providing there was no subsidy by taxpayers. That political contortion is the direct cause of the complexity of the measures: they have to support nuclear without explicitly supporting nuclear. Of course, the \"no subsidy\" claim is ludicrous in principle, given that taxpayers plays the same role for the nuclear industry as they did for the banks: they bail them out when things go wrong, an implicit subsidy. But it's ludicrous in practice too. One of the measures in the reform package is a minimum (floor) price for carbon emissions, which favours nuclear so clearly as to have prompted a backbench LibDem revolt. Incidentally, 'subsidy' is defined as \"a sum of money granted by the state or a public body to help an industry or business keep the price of a commodity or service low.\" The fact that renewable energy generators might get a smaller slice of the same pie does not mean it is not a subsidy. Let me be clear here. There is an argument, made by the government and others, that new nuclear power is absolutely necessary as low-carbon baseload, meaning state subsidies would be justified. If that argument carries the day, so be it. But burying the subsidies in an attempt to hide political embarrassment hinders proper debate. It's also worth noting that the pro-nuclear carbon floor price was delivered by the government far sooner and at a higher rate than expected. Contrast that with the cut in support for both solar power and marine energy, and the delay in the main energy efficiency policy, the Green deal. So, what to look out for on the reform plans expected on Tuesday? What will it cost energy customers? Many existing UK coal and nuclear plants will close this decade, meaning investment in energy infrastructure has to go up from the current £8bn a year to £20bn a year. Much of that cost will be put on household bills. If the cost is high, businesses will worry that unhappy voters will mean future ministers don't stick to their policies, as has happened in the UK and across Europe before. If the cost looks acceptable to bill payers, the plans have a chance. Who in the UK's big six energy companies is happy? Industry gossip says EDF, the French utility with the biggest stake in new nuclear, got exactly what they wanted in the proposals set out by the government. If EDF, with junior partner Centrica (who run British Gas) like the reform plans, then they are good for nukes. RWE npower and E.on also have bets on nuclear, but also big stakes in coal and gas, as well as high debt and opposition to nuclear at home in Germany. They warned last week that new nuclear stations in the UK could be too expensive for them. SSE has been the most supportive of renewable energy: if they are happiest, renewables have done well. Is there any obligation to build renewables? Backers of renewables worry that the \"contract for difference\" option favoured by the government will not support the sector well, compared to the existing system in which suppliers are required to deliver a certain proportion of renewable electricity. Are there incentives for energy efficiency? Cutting demand through efficiency measures is often cheaper than increasing the supply of low carbon electricity. But some observers worry that there will be few incentives in the reform package, beyond promising to look further at options. The government points to its Green deal: critics say this could have a big impact on gas demand, but not on electricity. Is there help for new entrants to the market? Energy secretary Chris Huhne promised last week to \"break the dominance of the big six\" energy companies, which provide 99% of the UK's power. That may be easier said than done. The one thing every participant in the energy debate will welcome is the end to at least some of the uncertainty about the UK's energy future, which had damaged investment in renewables in particular. As it stands, it looks like nuclear power will be the big winner from the reform package. It's also likely that the headlines will be dominated by cost, and arguments about whether household bills will be rising by more or less than in a high-carbon scenario. But will the government spring a surprise?

Across the region hit by the disaster, people bowed their heads in silence at 2:46 pm, the moment a magnitude-9 earthquake – the biggest in Japan's recorded history – struck, setting off a tsunami that would leave about 20,000 people dead or missing, and trigger the world's worst nuclear accident for 25 years. The tsunami damaged or destroyed 80,000 homes and disrupted supply lines to key industries, while the nuclear crisis spread radiation over large areas and forced the evacuation of about 100,000 people living in or near a 20-kilometre exclusion zone around the plant. The recovery effort is expected to take years to complete at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars. So far, only four of the 31 communities worst affected by the disaster have completed draft reconstruction plans. On Saturday, Japan's new prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, made his first visit to the tsunami disaster zone, promising local leaders he would speed up the reconstruction effort. Despite progress in rehousing an estimated 400,000 displaced people and clearing millions of tonnes of debris, many survivors say they face a bleak future. According to a survey by the public broadcaster NHK, 158,000 people lost their jobs in the three hardest-hit prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. Half of those surveyed said they had no prospect of finding work or would lose their incomes within a year. The Red Cross said Japanese bureaucracy had delayed the provision of assistance to victims. \"The speed and scope of implementing the response during the emergency phase was not as swift and comprehensive as [we] wished, partly due to the structure of disaster management in Japan, partly because of insufficient preparedness,\" it said in a report. Noda, Japan's seventh prime minister in five years , is dealing with the first crisis of his administration with the resignation of his trade and industry minister, who described the area near Fukushima Daiichi as \"towns of death\". Yoshio Hachiro, who had been in the post for just over a week, apologised for the remark, made after a visit to areas near Fukushima Daiichi that have been declared no-go zones. He added: \"You can't find a place like that anywhere. I couldn't think of any other way to describe it.\" Hachiro's fate was sealed on Saturday after newspaper reports that he had also pretended to rub his sleeve against a journalist while joking that he might be contaminated with radiation. Noda, who took office vowing to bring stability to Japanese politics, said: \"I apologise deeply to the people of Fukushima, who have had their feelings badly hurt. I continue to believe that without a revival in Fukushima, there will be no revival of Japan.\" Last month the government warned that dangerously high radiation levels could make areas near the plant unfit for human habitation for years, possibly decades. On Sunday, thousands demonstrated against nuclear power in Tokyo and several other cities. In one of the biggest protests, 2,500 people marched past the headquarters of Fukushima Daiichi's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, and formed a human chain around the trade ministry, which oversees the nuclear power industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/27/israel-tougher-iran-sanctions-barak-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-27T10:30:03Z","webTitle":"Israel calls for tougher Iran sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/27/israel-tougher-iran-sanctions-barak-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/27/israel-tougher-iran-sanctions-barak-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Israel calls for tougher Iran sanctions","bodyText":"Israel's deputy prime minister and defence minister Ehud Barak has called for the international community to toughen up sanctions against Iran as he warned that Tehran's nuclear weapons programme would lead to proliferation, the spread of terrorism and a threat to oil supplies from the Middle East. In a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Barak said: \"You can't conceive of a stable world order when Iran has nuclear weapons.\" He added: \"Iran is prepared to defy and deceive the whole world to turn themselves into a nuclear power. This will be the end of any conceivable anti-proliferation programme. Major powers in the region will feel compelled to turn nuclear.\" Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would respond to Iran arming itself with nuclear weapons with programmes of their own, Barak said. Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was sending a team to Iran on Saturday, adding he was convinced that Tehran was seeking to establish a nuclear weapons capability. Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is for non-military purposes, but Amano said: \"Our information is credible. Iran is engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosives. We have asked for talks and we are meeting with them.\" Barak said Iran wanted hegemony over oil resources from the Gulf region and said Tehran was secretly working towards a position where it would be able to arm itself with nuclear weapons. \"Iran is trying to intimidate and coerce neighbouring Gulf states\", he said. \"It is the time for much tougher diplomacy and sanctions because there is a risk not just to Israel but to the whole world. It will be much more complicated, much more dangerous and much more costly if we allow it to happen.\" It would have been impossible for the west to topple Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi had they been armed with even small nuclear arsenals, he added.

It says in the big book of cliche that a Guardian writer in the American south shouldn't lazily mention the fact that lots of people here carry firearms, but it seems worth noting because Tony the tiny taxi driver is threatening to shoot somebody. The book of cliche also bans hackneyed mentions of Alabama being a breeding ground for great American soul singers; we're just a few miles from Muscle Shoals after all. This also seems worth noting, though. Tony the tiny taxi driver might be about to shoot Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes. We pull up in a clearing on the lip of the woods. There is a beaten-up trailer, a constellation of wrecked cars around it. \"I hope this is the right address,\" he says, \"Cos if not, we're trespassing and I'm gonna have to shoot whoever comes out of that trailer before they shoot you.\" Brittany opens the door unarmed and welcomes us inside. Assured, Tony packs his pistol in his pants and drives his jeep back down the dirt track to the road. An American pitbull watches him leave. Brittany has a nuclear hangover. Yesterday was her last night out in her hometown of Athens (population 22,000) for the foreseeable future. This is because she starts her new job soon. She used to be a postwoman. Next week she becomes a star. \"Suddenly I'm having a hell of a time,\" she says. There is normally the ghost of a cigarette behind her. \"I went into a sports bar and everyone knew who I was. Well, not really. They just watched 'the thing'. Everybody got our back. Everybody know we're doin' it.\" \"The thing\" was a performance on Conan O'Brien's talkshow, Conan. Most bands must wait until their third album before Conan calls. Brittany quit the post office last November. We clamour for retro flavourings, anything that reminds us of time when the world of music seemed less full of wankers; hence the welcome soft-burn blues-drawl of the Black Keys. But Alabama Shakes make these memories taste like fresh produce somehow. They're not imitating the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin or Janis Joplin, they just sound like they've heard nothing since then. Maybe they were buried 50 years ago and have just been dug up. You can bury something for as long as you like: if you preserve it right it will still taste good. 'I bring a little bit of that punk with me. The energy, man; I can still thrash. I can't play the guitar very well but I can fake it' – Brittany Howard Drummer Steve Johnson first heard Brittany sing when he was 17: \"It was in a garage right across Highway 72, near here. She was 13. But she could really scream. That was 2003.\" \"I was in a punk band called Kerosene Swim Team,\" she says. \"It's what you do in Athens when you're bored and you can just yell about stuff. It's stupid, it's punk music. It's terrible … But I bring a little bit of that punk with me. The energy, man, I can still thrash. I can't play the guitar very well but I can fake it. I can scream. I can get away with it.\" \"Terrible,\" says Steve, \"is an understatement.\" Five years later Steve was working in the only music store in town when Brittany invited him to come and play with her and school friend, bassist Zac Cockrell. A demo they cut as \"the Shakes\" found its way into the hands of guitarist Heath Fogg, who'd left the same school a few years previously. He asked them to open for his band and discovered that night what everyone else was about to. A voice that enters through the pores, not the ears, that freefalls from growl to twisted whimper. A noise that has been locked inside a heart for hundreds of years, desperate for you to hear it, suddenly released. He joined the band and it worked. \"This is special,\" says Brittany. \"Actually, no. The fact that we're all from here … It's not just special, it's miraculous.\" When Alabama Shakes step onstage it can look like things are about to cut loose in the science department but when they play they rock, their music swooping from the heights of hope to the depths where there are none. And it is honest. When Lana Del Rey says she is \"born to die\", it is a notion stripped of sentiment by the ribbon in which it's wrapped. You don't believe her. \"Socks to darn\" perhaps, but not \"born to die\". The words should be indestructible but they are fleeting. When, on Alabama Shakes' lead single Hold On, Brittany sings \"Bless my heart/Bless my soul/Didn't think I'd make it to 22 years old\" you don't just believe her, you want to politely remind her to sort out her life insurance. The songs become pleas you can't answer. The band put together more demos in the first half of 2011 while holding down day jobs and expecting very little. Steve worked at a local nuclear power plant. \"I think he wore the whole suit,\" says Heath, \"he could be a radioactive drummer,\" which is apt, because he is as he plays, quick and tense like a man with a short half-life. One of their demos landed the band a sight-unseen support slot with Drive-by Truckers, which sent them on their way to the CMJ Festival in New York last October. At least one of the band had never been on a plane before. This handful of live shows spawned a million Facebook likes-worth of hype – given that they were a rare combination of a rock band with the muscle of the American pitbull outside, but built around Brittany's mesmeric, soulful stage presence. They came home and handed in their notices. Which is the best thing that can happen to any band, isn't it? 'I had a good job. I made way more money at the nuclear power plant than I have yet playing music' – Steve Johnson \"Are you joking? It's scary!\" says Brittany. Zac nods: \"I didn't wanna quit my job. I was worried about it.\" \"Me too,\" says Steve. \" I had a good job. I made way more money at the power plant than I have yet playin' music.\" People say it's early days, but sitting here in Brittany's dad's trailer, we are reminded how early some days are. And yet, Alabama Shakes are the most talked-about new band in the world. Conan came calling. Jack White had them over to his place. Robert Plant turned up at a show. The likes of Adele and Arctic Monkeys Alex Turner quickly spoke of their love for the band. Even Jamie Oliver, a man whose patronage previously made a nation scorch their retinas by briefly staring into the blinding light of Toploader, tweeted his excitement about their debut album, Boys &amp; Girls. Russell Crowe showed up at their first ever London gig, at north London Irish pub the Boston Arms. \"Cool,\" smiles Brittany, \"they listen to music. They're people too.\" She quickly changes topic, to sing the praises of what she calls \"the best burrito in America\" (naturally, we believe her) and we form a little convoy to go and eat one. There is a bang and a crunch as Brittany reverses her car. Nobody can see the dog any more. Right about the time Brittany is reversing the car – that her dad was planning to sell – into a tree, and her dog is sleepily emerging from its kennel to see what the noise is, tragically, 2,000 miles away, Whitney Houston is being found dead in the bathtub of an LA hotel. It says somewhere in the big book of cliche that we will thus link or compare the two women somehow, or suggest that a mantle has been passed, them both being great American voices and all. But we won't because we're busy listening to one of the most exciting frontwomen of recent times on the phone to her dad, trying to convince him to sell her the car at daughter rates before he finds out about the accident, while we stand beside the interstate eating what could well be the best burrito in the States. She should be listened to, she speaks the truth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2010/nov/07/ministers-nuclear-lobby-concerns-favouritism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-07T20:18:36Z","webTitle":"Ministers' meetings with nuclear lobby raise concerns of favouritism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/07/ministers-nuclear-lobby-concerns-favouritism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/nov/07/ministers-nuclear-lobby-concerns-favouritism","fields":{"headline":"Ministers' meetings with nuclear lobby raise concerns of favouritism","bodyText":"Thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on special meetings between ministers and the nuclear industry in Britain, prompting allegations the government is giving the sector an unfair advantage over renewable energy.

Two of those three external meetings with leading energy and engineering companies were attended by the secretaries of state at the time, Labour's Ed Miliband in March, and Chris Huhne in July, and the third meeting in October by the minister of state, Charles Hendry. Further meetings at the department's headquarters in Whitehall Place took place, for which costs were not provided. Concern about the preferential treatment given to the nuclear industry by successive governments is likely to be heightened by the decision last month to abolish the parallel Renewables Advisory Board, which met every quarter at the department and once a year outside, as part of spending cuts. The work of the renewables board will be taken on by the Office for Renewable Energy Deployment, for which there is a parallel Office for Nuclear Development. The developments are likely to fuel concerns among the many environmental campaigners who oppose nuclear power that the industry has unfair access to the government, as well as benefiting from hidden subsidies. \"They [government] have to come clean about all the money spent on assisting nuclear – and this would be part of that,\" said Mike Childs, head of climate campaigns for Friends of the Earth. \"It's important ministers come clean about who they are meeting, when they are meeting, and the issues they are discussing.\" In response to a Freedom of Information request from consultant and anti-nuclear campaigner David Lowry, Decc said that it had costed three external meetings with the NDF in 2010, spending £3,910 in March, £2,820 in July, and £1,416 in October. The coalition has promised there will be no subsidies for nuclear, but more than half Decc's £3bn budget last year was spent cleaning up nuclear waste through the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, and despite savage cost cuts across the rest of government in last month's spending review, the NDA budget will continue to rise up until 2014-15. There is widespread expectation that minsters will find other ways to ensure new reactors are built, including by setting a \"floor\" price for carbon that would make nuclear – and other non-carbon emitting renewable energy sources – more cost competitive. Another common claim is that assessments of the environmental benefits of nuclear power ignore many of the \"upfront costs such as mining and the on-going row over how to dispose of radioactive waste, and that claims nuclear power offers more security of supply are undermined by predicted shortages of uranium. \"To be honest, we had concerns about the Renewables Advisory Board, how effective it was,\" added Childs. \"They can set up an advisory board, but nobody's listening. It depends whether the secretary of state and ministers care about an issue.\" However not all environmental groups see nuclear and renewable energy in opposition. \"I don't think it's a competition about who can have however many committees,\" said Matthew Spencer, director of the Green Alliance of lobby groups. \"The question is: is policy going to be well formed by a regular interaction with people who are delivering on the ground?\" A Decc spokesman also rejected claims that the government was unfairly favouring nuclear power, adding that there were also forums for offshore wind and carbon capture and storage, the hope of catching and storing greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power stations. \"We do not believe this will lead to an unfair playing field and we are keen to see a diverse energy mix,\" said the spokesman. \"As the UK remains the global leader in operating offshore wind, we are committed to retaining this position by working closely with industry to overcome current barriers and help further investment.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-carbon-target-delay-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-23T16:06:04Z","webTitle":"Energy bill deal and carbon target delay – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-carbon-target-delay-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-carbon-target-delay-live","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill deal and carbon target delay – as it happened","bodyText":"I'm closing the liveblog now, but to wrap up: consumer groups are concerned over the increase in what households pay for energy bills for low carbon measures from 2% of bills today to 7% by 2020 (see uSwitch at 12.22 and Which at 2.45) businesses such as EDF and business groups including the CBI welcomed detail of the cap set for low carbon energy levies, though several investors said the energy bill proposals do not bring enough certainty (see EDF at 11.02 and investors at 2.30) there was largely widespread condemnation of the decision to postpone until 2016 on committing to a 2030 decarbonisation target (see 2.37, 1.25 and 12.33) which Labour yesterday promised to commit to if they win the next election Green MP Caroline Lucas is laying the blame for future bill rises at nuclear's door: Coalition ministers have stated again and again that their pledge to spend no public money on new nuclear will hold, yet it’s obvious that EMR [electricity market reform] has been designed to allow subsidy via the backdoor. Ministers must now come clean about their plans to subsidise the nuclear industry after 2020 through the ‘Contracts for Difference’ mechanism in the Energy Bill. At an estimated cost of up to £7bn per power station according to EDF, nuclear is eye-wateringly expensive and there’s a real risk that funding will be sucked away from renewables. The government must urgently ditch this obsession with nuclear power, which threatens to add a huge burden to household bills for decades to come. This brings me to one question that needs looking at in detail later – if the coalition's plans for up to eight new nuclear power stations don't bear fruit, what will the impact be on the projected £7.6bn rise in levies on energy bills? Both the Federation of Small Businesses and consumer organisation Which? are concerned about the increases to energy bills, though neither seems to suggest an alternative manner in which energy investment – which must happen to keep the lights on – should be done to minimise rises. It's not clear what mix of gas, nuclear, renewable energy or other sources they'd like to see. John Walker, the FSB's national chariman: While we welcome the much needed certainty the Energy Bill will give to investors to help secure the UK’s energy supply, we are concerned that small firms will be left exposed to ever increasing energy bills. The remorseless rise in energy costs is hurting not only individual businesses but also the competitiveness of the UK as a whole. Our research shows that utilities are the main cause of rising business costs for 45 per cent of small firms. What we really need is reform of the electricity market and investment in low carbon energy infrastructure to go hand in hand with radical changes in the retail energy markets. This would deliver tighter regulation of the big six energy companies and put in place stronger safeguards for both household and small business consumers. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?: Huge investment is undoubtedly needed if we are to keep the lights on but everything possible must be done to keep costs under control, especially at a time when rising energy prices are already one of people’s top financial worries. With a backdrop of inflation-busting energy price rises and large profit announcements from the big energy companies, consumers are rightly questioning whether the price they’re paying for their energy bills is fair. Real transparency and tough, independent scrutiny of the government’s plans are now vital to avoid unnecessary costs that consumers can little afford. We want to see contracts for new energy supplies studied by an independent panel of experts, including consumer representatives, before being presented to Parliament, to reassure the households that will foot the bill that this is good value for their money. If the government wants to help consumers, it needs to ensure its own policies aren’t going to send people’s already high and rising energy bills through the roof, and convince us about how they are going to keep a tight grip on the costs. Some more in-depth thoughts from WWF here, via their head of energy policy, Nick Molho, on why a 2030 decarbonisation target is so important: Whilst it's good to hear that the Levy Control Framework should mean that we can meet our renewable energy target for 2020 - and a lot of credit should be given to Ed Davey for that - the fact that there was so much relief in hearing that the UK would give itself the means of meeting a legally binding target says a lot about the terrible political context surrounding UK energy policy. The lack of a 2030 decarbonisation target means that there is very little clarity as to what will happen in the UK's energy market post 2020 and this risks creating a 2020 cliff edge in renewable energy investment. Without having an idea of the size of the market for clean energy technologies, investors and manufacturers are very unlikely to want to make long-term investments in the UK's clean energy sector. This is not surprising given that 2030 is only one investment cycle away. Take the example of an offshore turbine manufacturer: it takes you roughly 5 years to build an offshore wind turbine factory and then 10 years of regular operation to make your return on investment. You will not want to make an investment of £200 million or more unless you are confident about what the demand for your product is going to be out to 2030. It's a big shame the Prime Minister failed to provide this long-term certainty to the green infrastructure sector, one of the few current sectors of growth in our economy, which according to the CBI could halve our trade deficity by 2014/15. A decarbonisation target is also nothing for Mr Cameron's government to be afraid of - after all, it's a pre-condition for the UK to meet its emission reduction commitments under the Climate Change Act, an Act which Mr Cameron was instrumental in improving and getting through Parliament just 4 years ago. On a more serious note, it seems the details we've had so far may not be enough to bring certainty to investors. Pinsent Masons, a law firm who represent a lot of energy businesses, have written in to say: ...the potential overseas funders required to back projects - particularly large insurance, pension and asset management from areas like North America and Asia Pacific - will still have questions and there are still unsettling elements. For instance it is revealing that the The Gas Generation Strategy - undoubtedly a key component of future energy supplies - appears to be separated from the main reform package, perhaps reflecting a dominance of Treasury thinking rather than DECC’s on the role of gas.\" And Mark Kember, CEO of the Climate Group, which represents international leaders on climate change including business people such as Richard Branson and politicians such as Tony Blair, is pretty negative: The long-awaited Energy Bill, despite its positive elements and increased support for renewables, is a missed opportunity. It does not put emissions reduction at the heart of the UK’s energy policy. It does not put the UK on a long-term low-carbon, sustainable, clean energy path. The Bill is more of a grand compromise; and like all compromises it deals more with the present and the short-term than with the future. Unless there is long-term certainty for investors and clear signals that this country is open for low carbon business in the long-term the UK will be left behind in the global cleantech race. The jobs that could be coming to the UK are going to go elsewhere. If we do not lead, we are bound to follow others who will. Energy consultants Utilyx continue on the theme that the bill won't bring certainty to investors, with its risk analyst Andrew Horstead saying: As it stands now, The Energy Bill doesn’t bring anything more to businesses than the Government saying that a framework has been agreed. The uncertainty hasn’t gone away, in fact delaying the decision on the 2030 target until 2016 sends out rather mixed signals. On one hand the Government recognises gas as a flexible supply source, but on the other it suggests that by 2030 there may not actually be a role for gas if we are to decarbonise the power sector. No generator will invest millions of pounds into power plants that may get shut down in the near future. Don't panic. The Daily Mash reports that the energy bill means there \"is a reasonable chance Britain will still have electricity in two year’s time\" or, as its headline beautifully puts it: \"Britain to probably have some electricity\". Mr Davey reckons there could be at least 17,000 options for generating electricity such as knitting it, trapping it in a hole that has been covered with leaves and branches and using specially trained pigs to find it in forests. (h/t James Murray) In case you missed Davey standing up for the energy bill earlier, the Today programme have just put the clip up on AudioBoo. It features Greenpeace's Sauven, too, who I quoted earlier (at 1.11). Our environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, has been talking to Paul Dorfman of Warwick Business School: He questions whether the government is putting in place a \"fiscal cliff\" by which companies operating renewable energy will be unable to plan for their long term future, because the support regime after 2020 is uncertain. To have a windfarm operating in 2020, companies need to start building in the next few years. But without any guarantee of what they might receive beyond the next eight years, many potential developers are likely to be hesitant. See also the point made by the UK ERC (see 1.25) The Beeb has a decent Q&amp;A on the energy bill. This section, on what would happen without the investment in new nuclear and renewables, is important, as it flags up the fact the energy bill could save households and businesses money, in the long run: The government says that, if you take into account all of its energy policies, bills will actually fall by £94 on average by 2020. Energy efficiency will mean we use less and we'll be less reliant on gas. Rising gas prices added about £100 to the average bill between March last year and March this year, according to regulator Ofgem. In other words, if we just carry on as we are - importing much of our energy from overseas - we'll be worse off. The Committee on Climate Change agrees that bills would be higher without significant investment in clean energy. It is possible, therefore, that the Energy Bill, together with other measures to reduce carbon emissions, will actually save you money in the long run. Wondering how the costs on 2020 energy bills break down? This graphic from Decc is handy. It also includes the projected savings from government policies, such as through energy efficiency measures, which I haven't really touched on today. Here's one of the more damning reactions I've seen today, on the decarbonisation target delay, from the UK Energy Research Centre, based at Imperial College: The absence of a 2030 decarbonisation target in the Bill may not persuade investors of the need for new manufacturing assets in the UK, as there is a risk that these could be stranded after 2020 once the current targets have been met. Bloomberg New Energy Finance's analyst Nico Tyabji singles out one detail I haven't got into today – the company which will manage the way in which energy companies behind new nuclear and renewable energy power will get a certain price for the energy they generate. As Decc describes it: The creation of a Government-owned company to act as a single counterparty to give investors confidence to enter into new long term Contracts for Difference for low carbon electricity projects. As Tyabji puts it: The crucial development in this deal is the creation of a new, government-owned company, to back the support scheme for renewable electricity generation, so-called Contracts for Difference. This addresses a major shortcoming identified by investors in previous versions of the scheme, which risked increasing the cost of capital for clean energy investments in the UK. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven has chipped in on the subject of misleading headlines today, and the role of gas prices in household energy bills: Despite what the headlines say, new investment in clean energy is good news for consumers. Electricity bills are going up whatever happens because Britain needs to replace its ageing energy infrastructure. But investing in green energy is no more expensive in the long run than throwing the cash at mostly imported gas. With renewables we can pay now for the investment in new technology and save money later, but with gas we pay almost the same now but face rising costs well into the future. And when you throw in the huge economic benefits from new jobs and a potential new export industry in goods and services, renewables are the smart option for bills, the economy and the environment. Ed Matthew, the director of Transform UK, the group dedicated to \"accelerating investment into the low carbon economy\", has emailed me to say this: The Treasury has very kindly agreed to stick the entire cost of de-carbonising power on to UK consumer bills. Yet they are pocketing all the money they are raising in carbon taxes which also drives up energy bills. If they recycled carbon tax back to households they could create the world’s most ambitious and effective energy efficiency programme – making over half a million homes a year super energy efficient. It is enough to end fuel poverty and in time treat every UK home. A highly energy efficient home could cut its energy bill in half. This is the true test of whether the Government really want to help people drive down their energy bills. Our head of environment, Damian Carrington, writes with some thoughts, my emphasis in bold: Overall the publication of the energy bill is of course good news, nailing down as it does a good number of the measure that were expected. But here's three points to ponder: 1. The gaping hole in the bill is any measure to encourage the cheapest of all energy policies - efficiency. Greg Barker has suggested a feed-in-tariff for energy efficiency was under consideration, but where is it? 2. The fuss over the cost being added to bills needs to be put in context. Of course, any addition to bills is unwelcome, but they are going up under any scenario, bar the shale gas fantasy that obsesses George Osborne. Pushing up the support for renewable energy from 2% of bills now to 7% of bills in 2020 seems like pretty good value to me as an insurance policy against gas price spikes and climate change. 3. The decision not to set a decarbonisation target for 2030 is the first time I can remember that the government has rejected a recommendation from their official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. That's a pretty scary precendent, though you should note that the 2030 target was not statutory advice, unlike the carbon budgets. If you remember the fight to get the fourth carbon budget through, it's worth thinking about the chances of the next one if George Osborne is still chancellor. And here's a key point from Carrington's story about Miliband committing to the decarbonisation target yesterday: A few environment campaigners are flagging up the fact that much of today's debate doesn't take into account one of the self-interested reasons the UK is moving towards low carbon energy – ignoring climate change is more expensive than trying to fix it. Nicholas Stern in 2006 said climate change could cost the world at least 5% of GDP each year but if more dramatic predictions come to pass, the cost will be more than 20% of GDP. He initially said it would cost 1% of global GDP per year, before two years later revising that upwards to 2%. More on the Stern report here. The Institute of Civil Engineers has added its voice to those disapproving of the decarbonisation target delay. Here's its director general Nick Baveystock: The announcement on the long awaited Energy Bill is a welcome development, and provides some desperately needed clarity over the rules of the Electricity Market Reform and the steps that could help the UK progress towards a low-carbon generation. It is disappointing, however, that a clear 2030 decarbonisation target is missing. Committing to a consistent target to almost completely decarbonise electricity by 2030, would play a critical role in building certainty and confidence for both potential investors and industry. It would also help to enable a shift in public attitudes. If Government is serious about showing it’s commitment to a low carbon economy, it should set the target at the earliest opportunity. Here's a little bit of Twitter reaction. Many environmentalists not happy that the decarbonisation target has been kicked into the long grass, creating perceived uncertainty for investors. Decc seems to be trying to counter some of that negative comment by stressing the energy bill is preparing the ground for the target – but the reality is the target could've been introduced this parliament, if politics hadn't got in the way of the Committee on Climate Change's advice. Here's some consumer reaction. Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch, appears to be implicitly saying in her statement today that she's against the allowance for nuclear and renewables: We welcome any clarity on the impact of future investment on household energy bills – it’s important that consumers are made aware so they can take action to prepare for higher bills in the future and find information and support on how to limit the impact on their household. However, the fact remains that any additional cost on top of the hikes already seen will be unaffordable for many consumers. The average household energy bill today is already £1,334 a year and this is hurting people. We’re on the brink of an affordability crisis – research shows that when the average bill hits £1,500 a year a majority of households will be forced to take drastic action on their energy bills and this could lead to further compromises on health and wellbeing.\" Interestingly, there's no mention of Ofgem or the CCC's previous analysis showing that gas price rises are responsible for a large chunk of recent bill rises. Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP and member of the energy and climate change committee, just called our head of environment Damian Carrington with a cunning plan. He said he aims to persuade Miliband to immediately commit the next Labour government to an emission cap on power stations of 200gCO2/kWh. Gardiner says that level would halt the current dash for unabated gas, while leaving the door open for carbon capture and storage plants: It would show that Labour in opposition, while being responsible to the market [in giving long-term signals], can stymie George Osborne's dash for gas in a way that the LibDems in government cannot. And Gardiner's been busy on Twitter: Incidentally, regarding the delay to the decarbonisation target, you read it here on the Guardian first. Seven days ago we reported that a delay was on the cards as part of the heated negotiations going on inside government: Plans to limit the carbon emissions of future power stations are on the brink of being delayed until next parliament, in what would be a blow to the climate and energy secretary, green campaigners and business chiefs. Ministers have been wrangling over whether to include a 2030 \"decarbonisation target\" for the power sector in the energy bill, which is expected to be published in parliament within the next fortnight. The Guardian understands a decision on such a target now risks being delayed until after the next general election. A senior source close to the talks said: \"It's been a very difficult negotiation, there has been talk of postponing the setting of a target until next parliament. But if we are to address investor concerns, it has to be addressed this parliament.\" Davey's spokeswoman at the time denied a delay had been conceded (which may have been true at the time), but it turns out a decarbonisation target was the bargaining chip on which Davey had to give ground. There have been quite a few misleading headlines around this morning on how much energy bills will rise to pay for all these new turbines and reactors: Independent: Energy bills to rise by £170 a year to fund wind farms Telegraph: Wind farms to increase energy bills by £178 a year These figures are, as the Renewable Energy Association among many others put it, \"wildly over-stated.\" The correct figure for what we're going to be paying on energy bills for nuclear and renewables by 2020 is £95 in today's prices, a Decc spokeswoman points out. That's £75 more than the £20 we're paying now for such measures (or 2% of our energy bills as Davey was rightly keen to emphasise this morning. Some more reaction, from EDF, who are lined up to build most of the new nuclear reactors the UK wants, and the Committee on Climate Change, the government's climate advisers. John Gummer, former environment secretary under John Major's government and chairman of the CCC is, like most people today, pleased about the cap but less happy about the decarbonisation delay, which the CCC had called for: The agreement on the levy control framework is very positive. This should be sufficient to support investments in renewables required to meet the 2020 EU target and carbon budgets, together with demonstration of CCS and investment in nuclear new build. We are disappointed that a carbon intensity target will not be set until the next Parliament. This leaves a high degree of uncertainty for investors and does not address widespread investor concerns raised in recent months; it could adversely impact on supply chain investment and development of projects to come on line after 2020. It is essential now that delivery of the Electricity Market Reform proceeds on the basis that this is aimed at achieving early decarbonisation of the power sector, which is the economically sensible path in a carbon and resource constrained world.\" And EDF Energy's CEO, Vincent de Rivaz: We recognise the Government’s continued commitment to deliver the timetable for electricity market reform, including legally robust arrangements for much needed projects during the transition. This is good news and a significant step toward providing secure low carbon energy for the UK for many years to come.\" EDF added in its statement that the energy bill \"will give further clarity for investors\" but \"we now look forward to seeing further details\" (presumably, in particular, the level of the strike price that it's been negotiating with Decc over during the past few months). At the heart of what Davey, Osborne and the coalition have agreed for the energy bill is a Treasury rule known as the \"levy control framework\". It's a cap set by HMT on how high levies added to energy bills paid by you and me for environmental measures can go. The charges are for things such as feed-in tariff payments for people who have installed solar panels, help for fuel poor households and support through upcoming \"strike prices\" for low carbon energy sources such as new windfarms and nuclear reactors (more on that later). The Treasury calls it a mechanism to \"deliver the government's energy objectives while capping the impact on energy bills and ensuring that these policies are affordable over the long-term\" (you can read more on the framework here). What we now know is how much the Treasury will let this go up by. It'll go up from £2.6bn in 2012/13 to £7.6bn in 2020 (in today's prices). BusinessGreen, one of our partners on the Guardian Environment Network, has a handy roundup of reaction quotes. The organisations below welcomed some of the details announced so far, though many express disappointment at the delay on the decarbonisation target: Greenpeace RenewableUK [trade body for renewable energy sector] Energy UK [body representing all energy companies] Friends of the Earth CBI WWF Green Alliance Climate Change Capital Labour are going to make great hay of the delay on the decarbonisation target today. As my colleague Damian Carrington reported yesterday, Ed Miliband visited the UK's biggest onshore windfarm to formally commit his party to the 2030 carbon target (he'd already said he'd basically like to do so back in September). The decision by the coalition partners to delay a commitment on the target until 2016 means it'll now be an environmental issue in the election campaign. Labour and the Lib Dems are both for the target, while the Conservatives appear opposed. Miliband also laid into the government for a lack of clarity over energy bills: Ed Miliband has intensified the pressure on the coalition and its troubled energy plans by committing Labour to delivering a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030. The future of UK energy has been at the heart of a row within the government described as \"unholy war\" by one senior participant – with the energy secretary, Ed Davey, backing a decarbonisation target but the chancellor, George Osborne, implacably opposed. A broad range of industry, campaigners and even former Tory ministers have warned that the policy row is unsettling major investors and leading to uncertainty that could send energy bills soaring. Britain's growing green industry is facing a crisis of the government's own making, caused by scepticism at the heart of government. It is a policy shambles,\" Miliband told the Guardian. \"But it is not just an embarrassment for the government, it is a crisis for the UK.\" Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint has been on the tweet offensive already: Energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, was on the Today programme this morning. Here's Davey on the energy bill rises. He called headlines of huge increases, \"utter rubbish\": The impact from supporting green policy is only 2% on people's bills at the moment. That will grow and by 2020 it will be about 7%. We are talking about under £100 in 2020.\" He also repeated the Department of Energy and Climate Change's oft-used line that government policies including those on energy efficiency will knock £94 off household energy bills by 2020. On the question of whether the details given to media yesterday indicated a preference in the energy mix for renewables and nuclear (Davey's preference) or gas (George Osborne's preference), he said: I don't think it's gas or renewables. I think we need both, and actually they can be very complementary... I have been very clear and the Chancellor has been very clear that shale gas does offer an opportunity to the UK.\" Davey said a decision on whether to resume fracking for shale gas in the UK, which was halted after earthquakes near Blackpool following exploratory drilling last year, will be coming shortly. Decc has also published a statement on the energy bill deal morning. Here are the key passages on levies on bills and the 'decarbonisation target' I mentioned earlier: An amendment during passage of the Bill to take powers to set a decarbonisation target range for 2030 in secondary legislation. A decision to exercise this power will be taken once the Climate Change Committee has provided advice in 2016 on the 5th Carbon Budget which covers the corresponding period. In the meantime, the Government will issue guidance to National Grid setting out an indicative range of decarbonisation scenarios for the power sector in 2030 consistent with the least cost approach to the UK’s 2050 carbon target and reflecting both the existing fourth carbon budget and a scenario in which it is reviewed up, as outlined when the budget was set. The amount of market support to be available for low carbon electricity investment (under the Levy Control Framework) up to 2020 has also been agreed. This will be set at £7.6 billion (real 2012 prices) in 2020, which corresponds to around or £9.8 billion (nominal 2020 prices).\" And Decc's been tweeting, presumably in a nod to the Telegraph's headline: Last night, the government finally revealed the first details of its long-awaited energy bill. While the bill isn't expected to be published in parliament until next Thursday, we found out two key things last night: the cap on how much energy companies will be able to add to energy bills to help pay for new nuclear reactors and renewable energy such as offshore windfarms a decision on setting a so-called 'decarbonisation target' – which would have seen a limit set on how much power stations could emit in 2030 – has been delayed until after the election, in 2016 Here's the top of our report by Fiona Harvey and Juliette Jowit: Energy firms will be allowed to triple the amount of money they add to customers' bills to pay for renewable power, nuclear and other environmental measures, under plans to be announced by the government next week. The deal over a new energy bill, struck after weeks of sometimes bitter negotiations between the coalition partners, will mean the total amount energy suppliers can add to domestic and business bills will rise from £2.35bn this year to nearly £10bn at the end of this decade. Adjusting for inflation that would be worth £7.6bn in today's prices, an increase of nearly three times. Based on government estimates that green measures make up £20 of the average domestic gas and electricity bill of £1,249 a year, the cost of increasing the cash set aside to pay for renewable investment would rise to about £80, or £60 adjusted for inflation. However, officials argue that by the end of the decade the benefits of energy-saving measures and less reliance on expensive fossil fuel power will mean bills are actually lower than they would be without the green policies.\" Today I'll be scooping up reaction to the deal, which was struck after months of infighting between departments and the coalition's political factions. I'll also be examining what the true cost of building new green energy will be for household bills, with some media reports today – the Telegraph, for example – suggesting a rise of £95 by 2020 rather than the £80 we're citing. The Telegraph's headline, \"wind farms to increase energy bills by £178 a year\" appears to be clearly misleading, as that figure covers everything from support for nuclear power to help for people in fuel poverty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/dec/30/2013-same-old-story-business","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-30T00:06:14Z","webTitle":"2013 will be the same old story for business – and still no happy ending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/30/2013-same-old-story-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/30/2013-same-old-story-business","fields":{"headline":"2013 will be the same old story for business – and still no happy ending","bodyText":"Retail With Britons still treading financial water, 2013 promises to be another damp squib for the country's down-trodden retailers. We may have entered the banking crisis with a retail sector bloated by aggressive store expansion and easy credit but, after a five-year consumer recession, it is a leaner, meaner place today. A litany of failures from Woolworths to Zavvi, Game and Comet has resulted in tens of thousands of job losses but, against a backdrop of stagnant sales, the shake-out has helped stronger retailers thrive and there is every expectation that the pattern will continue in the coming months. Retail sales are intertwined with consumer confidence but with pay rises wiped out by inflation and more austerity measures about to kick in, the sector will remain in a holding pattern. Retail sales will grow 1.8% to £300.7bn, according to a report by analysts from SAS and Verdict but the projected increase is largely down to rising food prices. Bright spots will include the DIY and gardening sectors but spending on entertainment goods such as DVDs will tumble more than 6% as cheaper prices online and streaming takes over. This is a bad omen for the last man standing, HMV, which once again is in financial difficulties. There will also be trouble in store at Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer unless the turnaround plans of respective chiefs Philip Clarke and Marc Bolland show signs of momentum. The march of technology will also remain key to a retailer's success as tablets and smartphones change how Britain shops. This year online sales are expected to account for nearly 12% of the annual retail spend.

Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is expected to be one of the first banks to settle with global regulators in the early weeks of the new year. It is estimated to be facing fines of £400m for its role in manipulating the benchmark rate, but is unlikely to be alone in handing over millions to settle cases. It was the revelation in June that Barclays had made false submissions to help set Libor that prompted the creation of the cross-party parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. Its conclusions will be published in 2013, including a report – five years on – into what went wrong at HBOS, which had to be rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 and eventually needed a £20bn taxpayer bailout. One of the last acts of the soon to be disbanded Financial Services Authority will also be to give its verdict on HBOS. After the postmortems, a new era of banking regulation will be ushered in, with the Bank of England formally assuming new powers handed to it by George Osborne. It will also welcome new governor Mark Carney in July as Sir Mervyn King bows out after a decade at the helm. But expect September's fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers – which sparked the crisis that led to the bailouts of RBS and HBOS – to pass without any sign that British taxpayers are closer to getting their money back. Jill Treanor Economy Whether, like George Osborne, you call it \"healing\", or prefer Mervyn King's \"bumping along the bottom\", the outlook for the UK economy is dismal. We may avoid a triple-dip recession but it is likely to be a close shave. As the chancellor conceded in December, weak growth has made it harder to reach his goal of eliminating the structural budget deficit, even if an expected £3.5bn windfall from telecoms firms following the auction of 4G mobile phone spectrum materialises. With the goal of wiping out the deficit moving into the distance (2018 on the last count) and the national debt continuing to rise, the three major credit ratings agencies have put Osborne on a warning that Britain could lose the prized AAA status it held onto even through the winter of discontent. Ministers, including the Lib Dem chief secretary, Danny Alexander, have been keen to stress that the AAA badge is \"not everything\" but, for a coalition whose founding raison d'etre was placating the anxious bond markets, losing it would be a humiliation. While we can trust Ed Balls to insist that Osborne's austerity drive is solely responsible for the economy's parlous state, much will depend on what happens overseas. With households still burdened by debt, Britain will need to cultivate new markets abroad if it is to generate a sustainable recovery, and Osborne is targeting a doubling of exports. If the US plunges off the fiscal cliff and the advance of the Brics – Brazil, Russia, India and China – runs out of steam, that goal will look impossible. But if the US pulls back from the brink, and a new group of fast-growing economies takes over where the Brics leave off, there is – just – a chance that 2013 could be the year when recovery really starts in earnest. Heather Stewart Technology The UK will emerge from the mobile slow lane when the delayed auction of 4G spectrum for next-generation mobile services kicks off in January. The \"winners\" of the auction, and how much the carve-up has netted for the Treasury, will not be known until at least the end of February. We can, however, be certain that it is not going to collect anything like the £22.5bn the government banked from the sale of 3G in 2000. Osborne has pencilled in £3.5bn but analysts point to a reserve price of just £1.3bn. In Ireland last month, operators overcame a challenging economy to generate €854m. The bidders are Everything Everywhere – the combined T-Mobile and Orange operationcorrect, which is already offering 4G services – Vodafone, O2 and Three, as well BT, the Hong Kong conglomerate PCCW (which owns Hong Kong Telecom) and the British network company MLL Telecom. Strategy Analytics predicts 275m 4G-ready smartphones will be shipped worldwide in 2013, more than three times the 91m despatched in 2012. \"[4G] has quickly become a high-growth, high-value market that no operator, service developer, component maker or device vendor can afford to ignore,\" says Neil Mawston, wireless analyst at Strategy Analytics. Rupert Neate Industry BAE Systems and EADS attempted to redraw Europe's industrial landscape in 2012 with an audacious but doomed merger, whose consequences will continue to play out in 2013. BAE, Britain's largest defence contractor, is exposed to the UK and US defence markets, while EADS is still overly dependent on its Airbus unit. BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, has been the subject of shareholder grumbling, while a transaction with a US rival such as Boeing or Lockheed Martin is a possibility. Elsewhere, the European car industry is undergoing a restructuring that could see the loss of thousands of jobs. The sector is saddled with a manufacturing base capable of producing millions more vehicles than Europeans need. So expect more site closures, redundancies and political interventions. Vince Cable, the business secretary, stepped in to help save Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in 2012. His political peers on the continent will have to pull off similar feats in 2013 if they are to prevent the shutdowns that industry experts view as vital to the longevity of the industry. Royal Mail is also staring at a controversial restructuring, with the government expected to push for a privatisation that could take place as soon as the third quarter of 2013. The process will take the form of a full disposal or a partial flotation. Some analysts value the company, now formally separated from the Post Office network, at £4bn. Royal Mail's Canadian chief executive, Moya Greene, says \"all the necessary big steps\" have been taken before a sell-off can take place. But public opinion, and 140,000 members of the Communication Workers Union, could still cause problems. Dan Milmo Oil and energy Despite potential for major swings in the price of oil during 2013 analysts see little chance of crude dropping below $100 a barrel for any length of time. The value of \"black gold\" was expected to plunge in 2012 as global economic growth stuttered, but remained stubbornly high – largely driven by fears of supply disruption in the Middle East as a result of the Iran/US standoff and domestic political upheaval caused by the Arab spring. Spare production capacity within Opec members is at a historic low, leaving the market delicately poised at a time when demand should increase as the world economy picks up, especially in the second half of 2013. The US tipping back into recession and a worsening of the eurozone crisis would clearly send oil prices falling, but crude producers and analysts anticipate a more optimistic scenario. Oil company share prices have generally stagnated over the past year and there is no reason to expect anything other than a small uptick in 2013 (although Shell boss Peter Voser recently caused a stir when he told a German newspaper the Anglo-Dutch group had considered a move on BP – whose share price is still recovering from the Gulf of Mexico blowout – in the past two years and answered \"no comment\" when asked whether that ambition remained). Companies heavily exposed to US natural gas prices will have another bumpy ride as the shale \"revolution\" brings joy to manufacturers and other intensive energy users but pain to those, such as ExxonMobil, that invested heavily in gas when the price was double its current level. Outside the US, gas prices will remain high as countries such as Japan and Germany continue to abandon nuclear power for generating electricity, while subsidies to wind and renewables are hacked back in countries hit by national debt problems.

This was Britain's worst-ever nuclear accident, but no one was evacuated, no iodine pills were distributed, work went on and most people were not even told about the fire. But, thanks to Sellafield Stories, a book of interviews with nearly 100 people who worked there, lived nearby or whose lives have been linked to the vast West Cumbrian nuclear complex, we know more now about how people really reacted. Union leader and ex-Commando Cyril McManus says he thought the fire might mean the workers got a day off; Wally Eldred, the scientist who went on to be head of laboratories at BNFL, says he was told to \"carry on as normal\"; and chemist Marjorie Higham says she paid no attention. \"Things did go wrong so you just didn't take any notice. The less you know about it the less you can tell anyone else.\" \"You kept quiet. But you know you were scared stiff really. Those who were working there... didn't want to be seen against the thing,\" says Mary Johnson, now in her 90s, who was born on the farm that was compulsorily purchased to become the site of Sellafield. But we also know from the interviews that it was largely thanks to the courage of deputy general manager Tom Tuohy that the Lake District is still habitable today. When all else had failed to stop the fire, Tuohy, a chemist, now dead, scaled the reactor building, took a full blast of the radiation and stared into the blaze below. \"He was standing there putting water in and if things had gone wrong with the water – it had never been tried before on a reactor fire – if it had exploded, Cumberland would have been finished, blown to smithereens. It would have been like Chernobyl... there was contamination everywhere, on the golf course, in the milk, in chickens… but it was quickly forgotten about,\" says McManus. Everyone in West Cumbria has a relationship with Sellafield. Every family has someone who worked there or has somehow benefited from it. The book includes interviews with Sellafield foremen, scientists, managers, farmers, labourers, anti-nuclear activists, the vicar, the MP and bank manager, policemen, physicists, welders and accountants. My relationship began at 13 when I went to school at St Bees, just three miles away. We ran punishment runs past it, danced at Calder girls school, kissed the daughters of the scientists, were jeered at by the workers for wearing shorts and we got shown round it, I am almost certain, by Tom Tuohy, whose son was at school with us. I remember my dad saying the nuclear scientists thought they were \"little gods\" and my mum demanding that our medical records include the fact we were at school so close to the reactors. What emerges is the intimate, honest, sometimes ugly story of how a wartime bomb factory was dumped in one of Britain's most cut-off areas, turned to producing plutonium for the atom bomb, then nuclear electricity and is now a American-led multinational corporation decommissioning the mess that it largely created. But how did Sellafield become Europe's nuclear dustbin and the target of so much hostility to nuclear power? Its roots in weaponry explain the high security and the arrogance of its inward-looking early management. The fact that much of the workforce was drawn from the declining local iron ore and coal mines may explain the camaraderie of the workers and the vibrant community. But, the book suggests, its sheer physical isolation may have been responsible for some of the deep fears that people have of nuclear power. The stories, edited by Hunter Davies, suggest that much of what happened then is inconceivable now. Management, profligate with money, was criminally careless with safety and ecology. It thought nothing of trying to block Wastwater lake to get more water or trying to mine the national park for a waste dump. It recklessly dumped contaminated water out to sea and filled old mines with radioactive waste. It was useless with people, too. \"I used to get very cross with their housing policy. The place was set up very much like a War Department settlement. If you lived on a certain street, you were of a certain status within the works. It was just bonkers,\" says Alan Postlethwaite, the truculent vicar of Seascale, who was accused of being a crypto-communist for even thinking the plant might be linked to cancers. \"What aroused my anxieties was within 12 or 18 months I conducted the funerals of thee children who died of leukaemia. And that put the frighteners on us because we had small children. When you asked, 'How many would you expect in a community of 2,000 people?' and were told, 'Perhaps one in 20 years' and you'd had three in a year... that's something to bother about. No, I am not anti-nuclear, but my goodness, I think they could have made a better fist of it if they'd tried harder,\" he says. Seven rare cancers were found in the small Seascale community between 1955 and 1983, yet the authorities \"proved\" this was due to the natural movement of people. \"I often think there will have been a Seascale cluster of leukaemia because that's where the fallout from the big chimneys was closest. These people have pontificated about bringing the stuff in from outside systems and that would give the kids leukaemia. Now I look back and think, no, we caused that,\" says McManus. McManus suffered, too. \"It was a great job. Don't get me wrong. I left in 1990 a free man but plutonium-exposed. They told me I had a lung burden and that was an accumulation from the 30-odd years I'd worked at Sellafield. I was a radiation leper. I was a non-desirable person on site.\" But some folk could laugh it off. \"I could always tell when my husband had been irradiated… because... his hair was standing on end when he came home,\" says Pam Eldred, wife of Wally. The plant has changed. The bunker mentality has eased and the safety systems are better. But the economy of the region is more dependent on nuclear than ever before; the MP, Jamie Reed, is a former press officer for Sellafield and no one dares say anything critical if they want to keep a job. Instead of bumbling, British, gung ho pioneers, Sellafield is now run by corporate PR folk and slick American businessmen. Here's Dick Raaz, the outgoing head of the waste depository: \"The good news about radioactive waste is it self-destructs, if you just give it long enough.\" The bad news from the new management? Well, from the interviews with Raaz, Reed and former Sellafield boss Barry Snelson, there isn't any. The future is rosy. Just like in 1957."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/02/fukushima-setback-signs-nuclear-fission","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-02T09:08:41Z","webTitle":"Fukushima suffers setback as officials detect signs of nuclear fission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/fukushima-setback-signs-nuclear-fission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/02/fukushima-setback-signs-nuclear-fission","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima suffers setback as officials detect signs of nuclear fission","bodyText":"The operation to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has suffered a setback after officials said they had detected small traces of a radioactive gas that is a byproduct of nuclear fission. The discovery was made as a nuclear reactor in south-western Japan became the first to start generating electricity following a series of shutdowns in the wake of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. The operator of Fukushima Daiichi, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it had found signs of recent nuclear fission inside the No 2 reactor, one of three at the plant that suffered core meltdown in March. Japan's nuclear safety agency said the situation was stable and that the small amounts of radioactive material did not present a risk to public health. The utility dismissed the possibility of a \"major criticality accident\", in which a sustained nuclear reaction occurs, but has not ruled out localised criticality inside the reactor. The reactor's pressure and temperature had remained stable, it said, adding that radiation levels in the vicinity had not risen. Workers began injecting water containing boric acid into the reactor via a cooling pipe to prevent a possible fission chain reaction. \"Given the signs, it is certain that fission is occurring,\" Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at Tepco, told reporters. Evidence that even partial or temporary nuclear fission had occurred underlined the fragile state of the plant almost eight months after it was struck by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out vital cooling systems. The accident, the worst in the history of the Japanese nuclear power industry, forced the evacuation of 80,000 residents from a 12-mile radius around the plant. People living closest to Fukushima Daiichi have been told their old neighbourhoods could remain unsafe for decades. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take at least 30 years, according to a recent report by the country's nuclear energy commission. A Tepco spokesman insisted that the latest setback would not affect the company's roadmap towards making the plant safe by the end of the year. \"We have confirmed that the reactor is stable and we don't believe this will have any impact on our future work,\" Osamu Yokokura told Associated Press. Tepco said it had detected low densities of radioactive xenon-133 and -135 in gas samples extracted from the No 2 reactor. The substances have relatively short half-lives of five days and nine hours, respectively, so their presence suggests that nuclear fission has occurred undetected inside the reactor very recently, raising the possibility of lingering activity inside its melted core. The news coincided with the restart of a reactor at the Genkai nuclear plant in Saga prefecture on the island of Kyushu. The reactor, which shut down automatically after an abnormality was spotted early last month, went back into service on Tuesday night and began generating electricity on Wednesday, according to Kyushu Electric Power. The reactor will shut down again in December to undergo safety checks. Only 19 of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors are currently in operation due to regular inspections or earthquake damage. They must pass recently introduced stress tests before they can go back online, although strong local opposition could delay or prevent the restart of reactors even after they are given the all-clear. The government approved Genkai's restart after attributing the fault to human error and approving the utility's response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jan/05/greenometer-government-green","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-18T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"Green-o-meter: Is the government keeping its green promises?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/05/greenometer-government-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/05/greenometer-government-green","fields":{"headline":"Green-o-meter: Is the government keeping its green promises?","bodyText":"Last May, David Cameron promised the coalition would be the \"greenest government ever\". This year environmentguardian.co.uk is going to track his progress. The current rating on the green-o-meter is a light-hearted attempt to track the serious matter of how the coalition is faring. It assesses the government's delivery on all aspects of the environment, from climate change, wildlife and conservation to energy efficiency, transport and renewable power, as covered by the stories below. Swing history 18 June 2012: Damian Carrington, head of environment, writes: We are overdue a stock take. The good news is that the government is pushing on with some very big policies: transforming the energy market to deliver both clean and secure energy and the green deal to transform the home energy efficiency of 14m homes. The bad news is that while the ambition is high, the implementation is poor. That is not helped by the political headwinds blowing from the powerful Treasury, making each step forward a struggle. David Cameron claimed his government was already the \"greenest ever\" in April, so let's consider the evidence: • Energy market reform: plans big changes but appears hopelessly compromised by its determination to subsidise the building of new nuclear power stations at any cost and loopholes for coal • Green deal: will solve the problem of up-front cost for efficiency measures that will cut energy bills -if people take out the loans - but it will cause loft and cavity wall insulations to plummet • The Budget: George Osborne's \"fossil-fuelled fantasy on the road to nowhere\", as I said in March • Prime minister: David Cameron's leadership is desperately needed but his no-show in at the Rio+20 summit and his non-speech on green energy in April show \"vote blue, go green\" has been abandonded • Energy efficiency in Europe: Appalling action by the UK behind the scenes in Brussels to weaken ambition • European fisheries reform: A bright spot. The UK helps deliver a good, if not perfect, deal • Green investment bank: Has now made its first investments. But it still looks woefully underpowered, despite being in the perfect position to deliver the economic growth the government is yearning for • Attacks on onshore wind subsidies: More enemy action from Osborne, driving up uncertainty for investors and therefore costs for hard-pressed energy bill payers • Drought: Handled competently and without fuss but missed a big opportunity to reform ridiculously poor leakage reduction targets in water white paper • \"Conservatory tax\" U-turn: A spectacular example of political cowardice trumping common sense • Buzzards U-turn: Idiotic programme that should never have seen the light of day • Mandatory carbon reporting for businesses: The CBI says business wants it so why the delay? Taking all that lot together, its clear the government is not doing any better on the green agenda, but it's not doing much worse. The green-o-meter remains stuck at a lowly 1.5. 30 November 2011: Damian Carrington, head of environment, writes: Greg Barker, minister at the department of energy and climate change, defends the government's green record, saying it is \"underpromising and overdelivering\". What he is arguing is that policies are being delivered - e.g. Green deal, Green investment bank - but they are not shouting about them. But words matter. Transforming a nation to a sustainable, secure, low-carbon economy needs leadership from the very top to give investors the confidence needed to commit the huge sums needed. That means chancellor George Osborne's stunningly contemptuous attack on green action in his Autumn statement were fatal for the ambition to be the greenest government ever. So the green-o-meter plunges to a new low: 1.5. 24 November 2011: Damian Carrington, head of environment, writes: The government has finally got its Green Deal out the door. This ambitious plan to refurbish 14m homes to make them more energy efficient is much needed to keep bills and carbon emissions down, though a successful roll out is challenging. Chris Huhne also came out fighting on the effect of his policies on energy bills: they will curb the inevitable increases. On the negative side, the necessary but bungled reform of the solar power subsidies has really dented confidence across the renewable industry. On balance, half a point up, to 2.5. 21 October 2011: Damian Carrington, head of environment, writes: David Cameron's detoxifying pledge to be the greenest government ever is in mortal peril. The latest blows including cuts to support for clean, sustainable energy and the collapse of the UK's only bidder for £1bn to build the UK's first carbon capture and storage demonstration plant. 5 October 2011: Damian Carrington, head of environment, writes: Bong! Down the green-o-meter plunges, from 3.5 to 2.5. Why? Principally because of the low-carbon clanger the Chancellor George Osborne dropped at the Conservative party conference, wrongly blaming green taxes for soaring energy costs and backing away from UK climate leadership. David Cameron's speech gave only the most cursory, passing mention to green policies. The ludicrous pledge to raise the motorway speed limit to 80mph and the unnecessary squandering of £250m on bring back some weekly bin collections were also negative marks, as was the bungle over the renewable heat incentive. I attended all four political party conferences – yes the Greens in Sheffield too. Green issues were relatively low key at all of them, though Labour's pledge to break the big six energy companies' \"stranglehold\" was a rare standout idea. However, only the Conservatives appeared to be actively moving away from green issues. Despite the energy and climate change ministers continuing to push forward big policies, the environment department remains feeble. But it is the change of tone from the two men running the world's sixth biggest economy that matters. You don't become the greenest government ever by telling people the nation's green ambition is to be mediocre. 13 July 2011: Damian Carrington writes: The UK's electricity system has started on the road to major reform. It's a huge step forward from the free-for-all market we have now, which kept prices down for a while, but utterly failed to invest in the future. Chris Huhne's plan is not as strong as it needs to be on renewables and cutting energy use - that's less pressing if you have bet much of your money on nuclear, as Decc have. There's also a lot of detail to work out. All in all, up goes the green-o-meter to 3.5. 6 July 2011: Damian Carrington writes: The UK government not only met its 10:10 campaign pledge to cut the carbon emissions from its own operations by 10% in a year, it achieved a cut of 14% and promised a 25% cut by 2015. That's real action and leading from the front. Up goes the green-o-meter to 3.0. 14 June 2011: It could have been a double whammy for the environment department, with two flagship policies arriving within a week: the natural environment white paper and the national waste review. Both laudably aimed to redefine attitudes, to valuing the natural world and dumping rubbish, respectively. But, concluded, Damian Carrington, neither delivered. Back down to a below-par 2.5. 23 May 2011: Another cabinet battle, another green win. Nick Clegg announces the details of the green investment bank, revealing a strong, independent bank with £3bn guaranteed for starters. The GIB can still only borrow from 2015, but overall the news suggests supporters of the green economy are defeating the \"dark forces\" of the old economy in the Treasury. It's enough to push the green-o-meter up from 2.5 to 3.0. 17 May 2011: After a cabinet battle, prime minister David Cameron committed the UK government to accepting official advice to set an ambitious and legally binding target for the 2020s, equivalent to a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2027. Damian Carrington wrote: \"Winning that argument was a significant political victory. But in terms of green policy that will deliver an economy fit for an evermore crowded and consuming planet, it was only a disaster avoided. Nonetheless, with politics being the art of the possible, the green-o-meter moved up half a notch, to recognise a step in the right direction.\" 23 March 2011: UK budget day was a green catastrophe, sending the green-o-meter plummeting to 2.0, an all time low. George Monbiot called it \"the blackest budget in living memory, from the team that claims to be the greenest government ever.\" Damian Carrington's analysis of the green investment bank that can't borrow, the boosts for motoring and flying and a feeble carbon floor price, concludes: \"There was a golden chance to use the wreckage of the recession to build a greener, cleaner and more sustainable economy, creating jobs and tackling climate change. But when it mattered, the old politics and the old economics won.\" 11 March 2011: The green-o-meter moved up another notch to 3.5, following the government's 'green week', which delivered £860m for clean, green heating, continued promises to cut the government's own emissions and pumped up the pressure on other departments to accelerate the green agenda. 17 February 2011: We moved the green-o-meter up from 2.5 to 3, off the back of David Cameron's u-turn on the forest sell-off in England, despite recent news of a 40% cut to the Carbon Trust's budget. 31 January 2011: We moved the green-o-meter down from 3 to 2.5, because of the detail contained in the government's forest consultation and news that the Energy Saving Trust is to have its funding cut by half. 18 January 2011: We moved the green-o-meter down from 3.5 to 3, following John Vidal's expose of government spinning on the state of UK wildlife and nature reserves and reader feedback on Damian Carrington's blog.

Internal emails seen by the Guardian show how the business and energy departments worked closely behind the scenes with the multinational companies EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse to try to ensure the accident did not derail their plans for a new generation of nuclear stations in the UK. \"This has the potential to set the nuclear industry back globally,\" wrote one official at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), whose name has been redacted. \"We need to ensure the anti-nuclear chaps and chapesses do not gain ground on this. We need to occupy the territory and hold it. We really need to show the safety of nuclear.\" Officials stressed the importance of preventing the incident from undermining public support for nuclear power. The Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who sits on the Commons environmental audit committee, condemned the extent of co-ordination between the government and nuclear companies that the emails appear to reveal. \"The government has no business doing PR for the industry and it would be appalling if its departments have played down the impact of Fukushima,\" he said. Louise Hutchins, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, said the emails looked like \"scandalous collusion\". \"This highlights the government's blind obsession with nuclear power and shows neither they, nor the industry, can be trusted when it comes to nuclear,\" she said. The Fukushima accident, triggered by the Japan earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, has forced 80,000 people from their homes. Opinion polls suggest it has dented public support for nuclear power in Britain and around the world, with the governments of Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Thailand and Malaysia cancelling planned nuclear power stations in the wake of the accident. The business department emailed the nuclear firms and their representative body, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), on 13 March, two days after the disaster knocked out nuclear plants and their backup safety systems at Fukushima. The department argued it was not as bad as the \"dramatic\" TV pictures made it look, even though the consequences of the accident were still unfolding and two major explosions at reactors on the site were yet to happen. \"Radiation released has been controlled – the reactor has been protected,\" said the BIS official, whose name has been blacked out. \"It is all part of the safety systems to control and manage a situation like this.\" The official suggested that if companies sent in their comments, they could be incorporated into briefs to ministers and government statements. \"We need to all be working from the same material to get the message through to the media and the public. \"Anti-nuclear people across Europe have wasted no time blurring this all into Chernobyl and the works,\" the official told Areva. \"We need to quash any stories trying to compare this to Chernobyl.\" Japanese officials initially rated the Fukushima accident as level four on the international nuclear event scale, meaning it had \"local consequences\". But it was raised to level seven on 11 April, officially making it a major accident\" and putting it on a par with Chernobyl in 1986. The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has released more than 80 emails sent in the weeks after Fukushima in response to requests under freedom of information legislation. They also show: • Westinghouse said reported remarks on the cost of new nuclear power stations by the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, were \"unhelpful and a little premature\". • The company admitted its new reactor, AP1000, \"was not designed for earthquakes [of] the magnitude of the earthquake in Japan\", and would need to be modified for seismic areas such as Japan and California. • The head of the DECC's office for nuclear development, Mark Higson, asked EDF to welcome the expected announcement of a safety review by the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, and added: \"Not sure if EDF unilaterally asking for a review is wise. Might set off a bidding war.\" • EDF promised to be \"sensitive\" to how remediation work at a UK nuclear site \"might be seen in the light of events in Japan\". • It also requested that ministers did not delay approval for a new radioactive waste store at the Sizewell nuclear site in Suffolk, but accepting there was a \"potential risk of judicial review\". • The BIS warned it needed \"a good industry response showing the safety of nuclear – otherwise it could have adverse consequences on the market\". On 7 April, the office for nuclear development invited companies to attend a meeting at the NIA's headquarters in London. The aim was \"to discuss a joint communications and engagement strategy aimed at ensuring we maintain confidence among the British public on the safety of nuclear power stations and nuclear new-build policy in light of recent events at the Fukushima nuclear power plant\". Other documents released by the government's safety watchdog, the office for nuclear regulation, reveal that the text of an announcement on 5 April about the impact of Fukushima on the new nuclear programme was privately cleared with nuclear industry representatives at a meeting the previous week. According to one former regulator, who preferred not to be named, the degree of collusion was \"truly shocking\". A spokesman for the DECC and BIS said: \"Given the unprecedented events unfolding in Japan, it was appropriate to share information with key stakeholders, particularly those involved in operating nuclear sites. The government was very clear from the outset that it was important not to rush to judgment and that a response should be based on hard evidence. This is why we called on the chief nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, to provide a robust and evidence-based report.\" A DECC source played down the significance of the emails from the unnamed BIS official, saying: \"The junior BIS official was not responsible for nuclear policy and his views were irrelevant to ministers' decisions in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake.\" Tom Burke, a former government environmental adviser and visiting professor at Imperial College London, warned that the British government was repeating mistakes made in Japan. \"They are too close to industry, concealing problems, rather than revealing and dealing with them,\" he said. \"I would be much more reassured if DECC had been worrying about how the government would cope with the $200bn-$300bn of liabilities from a catastrophic nuclear accident in Britain.\" The government last week confirmed plans for eight new nuclear stations in England and Wales. \"If acceptable proposals come forward in appropriate places, they will not face unnecessary holdups,\" said the energy minister, Charles Hendry. The NIA did not comment directly on the emails. \"We are funded by our member companies to represent their commercial interests and further the compelling case for new nuclear build in the UK,\" said the association's spokesman. \"We welcome the interim findings of the independent regulator, Dr Mike Weightman, who has reported back to government that UK nuclear reactors are safe.\" • This article was amended on 1 July 2011.

The warning from four energy providers came after the German chancellor suggested she agreed with a proposal to shut down all of Germany's 17 nuclear power plants by 2022. Seven nuclear power stations have been off-grid ever since Merkel announced in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster a \"three-month moratorium\" on her controversial decision last year to extend the lives of the plants. Merkel ordered safety checks on all reactors and set up two commissions – one on safety and another on ethics – to look at whether Germany had a nuclear future. The resultant safety report will be evaluated by the German government, along with a separate report by an ethics commission due on May 28, before it makes a final decision on nuclear power. But over the weekend, Merkel said the year 2022 was \"the right space of time\" to set as a goal for Germany's total withdrawal from nuclear power. She was speaking after the CSU – the Bavarian sister party of her Christian Democratic CDU – voted for all German nuclear power plants to come off-grid by 2022. Merkel did not herself commit to a firm date for nuclear decommissioning. The timetable is too slow for many of Merkel's opponents. Claudia Roth, co-head of the national Green party, which beat the chancellor's CDU in elections in Bremen on Sunday, insists it would be feasible to close down all plants by 2017. According to a report in Monday's Süddeutsche Zeitung, four firms which operate Germany's network of high-voltage power cables and pylons - 50Hertz, Tennet, EnBW Transportnetze and Amprion – believe Germany cannot currently cope without nuclear power. The companies say that the grid is already \"largely exhausted\" during winter months when solar power is at a minimum and when wind cannot be relied on to keep turbines in motion. The firms warned in a statement that calm winter days with no wind could result in \"large-scale supply disruptions\", particularly in Germany's affluent and industry-heavy south, which guzzles much of the country's electricity. \"A safe supply to customers in these cases could be severely compromised,\" they said. There are no current problems because good weather in Germany has meant that solar panels have been able to compensate for the shortfall left by the decommissioned nuclear plants. The industry group German Atomic Forum cautioned against abandoning nuclear power without careful consideration. \"A quick and rash exit from German nuclear power would raise costs for the whole economy, make us miss climate goals, raise our reliance on fossil fuels and make our power supply less secure, meaning more power imports and problems with network stability,\" said president Ralf Gueldner. \"It would also spark intense debate in the European Union,\" he added. Nuclear power has long been unpopular in Germany and Merkel's decision last year to extend the life of nuclear plants was a major factor in her party's loss of power after 60 years in Baden-Württemberg – a prosperous conservative state – in March. Her about-turn on nuclear policy was derided as \"knee-jerk\" by many of her critics. Currently, nuclear energy supplies 22.3% of Germany's electricity while coal provides 42%, natural gas 13.6% and renewable energies 16.5%, according to the environment ministry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/11/japan-nuclear-reactors-tsunami-test","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T07:44:26Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear reactors must pass tsunami test before reopening","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/japan-nuclear-reactors-tsunami-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/11/japan-nuclear-reactors-tsunami-test","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear reactors must pass tsunami test before reopening","bodyText":"Japan's idle nuclear reactors will not be allowed to restart unless it is proven they can survive giant tsunamis and other extreme events, the country's government has said. But with no timetable decided for two rounds of \"stress tests\" and electricity demand soon to reach its summer peak, concern is growing that Japan may experience power shortages at the hottest time of year. The first round of tests will focus on reactors that have completed routine safety checks and would have already restarted had the accident at Fukushima Daiichi power plant not plunged Japan's nuclear industry into crisis. The tests will examine the reactors' ability to withstand natural onslaughts of far greater force than previously factored into safety checks. They will, for example, examine their ability to withstand an unusually severe event similar to the magnitude-9 earthquake and 15m tsunami that knocked out back-up generators at Fukushima Daiichi, leading to core meltdowns in three reactors. In the second stage, all of Japan's nuclear power facilities will undergo a general safety assessment. Only 19 of the country's 54 nuclear reactors are in operation due to delays in restarting those that have undergone maintenance checks or were shut down after the 11 March tsunami. In addition, reactors that are operating could be forced to close immediately if they fail the first round of tests, the government has said in a statement. As it attempts to calm public fears over safety, the government must contemplate a worst-case scenario in which every last nuclear reactor will be idle by next April as more come offline for regular inspections. That would seriously compromise the country's ability to produce enough electricity and could result in power shortages lasting into the summer of 2012. Major users of electricity have already been told they must cut peak power use by 15% from this month to avoid blackouts this summer. Nuclear provided about 30% of Japan's energy before the crisis. Plans to increase supply to more than 50% by 2030 were ditched after the prime minister, Naoto Kan, ordered a review of energy policy and promised a much bigger post-Fukushima role for renewables. \"Safety and a sense of security are the top priority,\" said Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary. \"One the other hand the government must fulfil its responsibility to provide a stable supply of electricity … we will make every effort to secure that in the medium and long term.\" Edano could not say when the first round of tests would begin, only that they would happen \"soon\" and be overseen by Japan's nuclear safety commission, which is considered more independent of the government than the nuclear safety agency. Last week's surprise decision to conduct stress tests has caused confusion among the public and angered industry officials who want idle reactors restarted as soon as possible. In June government officials, citing reviews by the nuclear safety agency, said reactors that had been shut down for regular checks were safe to restart. At the time the economy minister, Banri Kaieda, said: \"There is no problem regarding safety concerning the continued operation and restart of nuclear power stations.\" On Friday Kan apologised for dithering over the tests, which will be modelled on those being conducted on reactors in European Union member states. \"My instructions were inadequate and came too late,\" he said. \"I take responsibility for that.\" Officials in Fukushima prefecture said they had detected high levels of radioactive caesium in straw fed to cattle at a farm in Minamisoma, a town near the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Tests were carried out on feed and water samples from the farm after caesium at levels three to six times higher than the provisional legal limit of 500 becquerels per kilogram were found in 11 cows, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The cows had been shipped to a meat packing plant in Tokyo and slaughtered but their meat did not go on sale, Kyodo news agency said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/aug/26/london-airport-expansion-just-decide","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-26T18:30:00Z","webTitle":"A third runway, Boris Island, better rail?

Please, just decide","bodyText":"To steal the omnipresent Nike slogan: Just do it. There is no \"right\" answer to the great conundrum of where to build more airport capacity for southern England. When every option causes major protests in marginal constituencies, the easiest course is to do nothing. So far, this has been the coalition's response. But it's dishonest politics and increasingly contemptible. Why? Because all the major business voices the government says it listens to agree that Britain needs more capacity. And at a time when the economy is flat on its back, with no help coming from growth anywhere nearby, one of the few things even a Tory-led government can do is to create capacity for growth. Yes, there are good green arguments against any increase in growth, particularly in transport, but they are a million miles away from the stated beliefs of the people who are actually in charge. There is nothing new about controversial and politically dangerous infrastructure projects, from the first railways to the Channel tunnel, from the original creation of London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, to the first motorways and nuclear power plants. Victorian politicians just did it. The Macmillans, Wilsons, Heaths, Thatchers sucked their teeth – but in the end, they just did it. This lot, however, apparently won't. For several months there have been mutterings and murmurings in Tory circles about a likely U-turn and a third Heathrow runway. Now, seemingly, we have to read the runes of the forthcoming reshuffle to assess what the government is thinking on the issue. Will Justine Greening, the transport secretary, be moved out? She represents Putney, a constituency deeply affected by any Heathrow decision, and has repeatedly emphasised her opposition to a third runway. Will Grant Shapps be moved in? He has certainly been pressing his case, saying that we need to reconsider a third runway if we are to remain \"a great trading nation\". Shapps is far from a lone voice. Owen Paterson, the Northern Ireland secretary, has also joined the campaign, saying growth in Northern Ireland will be hit without expansion at Heathrow. Add to that the Free Enterprise group of Conservative MPs, who back the idea and suggest up to £40,000 in compensation to householders, and you have a considerable turning of the tide. The chancellor, George Osborne, said back in March that we had to confront the lack of runways in London. He's been listening to businesses, here and overseas, who complain that unless Britain runs more direct flights to developing economies like China, Chile, Venezuela and Indonesia, it will lose its valuable international connectivity and hub status. Heathrow will lose its position as Europe's busiest airport, and businesses will stop wanting to locate here. It's an obvious straw for an embattled chancellor to clutch at. Meanwhile, London's irrepressible mayor, Boris Johnson, opposes any expansion at Heathrow but wants a Thames estuary airport – already nicknamed \"Boris Island\". Never slow to make political capital from government delay, Johnson accuses the government of \"pussy footing\" around, and says that attempts to kick the controversial decision into the long grass are \"totally mad\". But Zac Goldsmith, the independent-minded and environmentalist Tory MP for Richmond Park, promises to resign if a U-turn is announced. The Lib Dems, in line with their green agenda, remain strongly opposed to any U-turn – but we have seen them overruled before. Think tuition fees. So, for now, we have another impasse, with last month's draft aviation policy framework announcement skipping over the question of whether or not the third Heathrow runway will be revived. Labour doesn't find this issue easy, either. Remember it was Geoff Hoon, a transport secretary in the last Labour government, who approved the controversial plan for expansion back in 2009. That decision was reversed in the coalition agreement, and Ed Miliband says he opposes it too. But there are still respected Labour voices, including former chancellor Alistair Darling, who support the plan. Just as with a long-term strategy for social care, the future of Britain's aviation policy is fatally flawed by a lack of guts, a lack of vision, and a craving for short-term popularity. Several Conservative MPs now admit the decision to cancel a third runway was a mistake, but it's perfectly clear why it was taken. David Cameron needed to win those seats in south-east London where homes are already blighted by noise from Heathrow. (I know, I live there.) Yet with the coalition agreement stating categorically that there would be no third runway at Heathrow, how is trust in politics going to be revived if yet another promise is broken? Let's hear the facts: a report commissioned by airport owner BAA says the UK risks missing out on trade with developing countries worth £14bn during the next decade if Heathrow is not expanded. China is planning 15 new airports by 2015. So yes, the UK could lose out. But then there are the environmental effects: Heathrow generates 50% of the UK's aircraft emissions already, and now is surely a time to be reducing, not increasing, emissions. The village of Sipson, comprising 700 households, would have to disappear – and thousands of other Londoners would suffer a big increase in noise pollution. As with all major decisions, there are pros and cons, swings and roundabouts. But some kind of decision has to be made. Is \"Boris Island\" really a non-starter? How feasible is expansion at Gatwick, Stansted or RAF Northolt? What about much greater investment in the railways to curb domestic flights? Or are the economic arguments so great that runway three must go ahead? I go back to where I started. There is no \"right\", self-evident, politically safe answer – Boris Island is vastly expensive and would take for ever; neither Gatwick nor Stansted are easy to expand; and Heathrow would be a big political U-turn, probably causing resignations. Yet something needs to be done. And we are now at the point when it's more important to take a decision – any decision – than to carry on mumbling. So, ministers, be open with us. Spell out the problems with all the options. Then, for God's sake, choose one. That's what the cabinet is there for – and if it can't take big, strategic decisions, it's barely a government. I may not agree with Jo Valentine, the chief executive of business group London First, who argued on Sunday that expansion at Heathrow was the right answer. But she is certainly right when she says: \"The time for ministers to prevaricate is long past.\" • This article was amended on 28 August 2012.

If they have no monetary value, their assumed value is zero. If their value is zero, then destroying them is harmless, despoiling them no loss, poisoning them no problem. For half a century, the green movement has urged greater awareness, more conservation, reducing our footprint on nature. Yet despite some limited successes, this approach has failed overall. Our demands on the natural environment are rising, not falling. Valuing natural capital requires us to train accountants to value every tiny, implausible detail of the biosphere around us. Will it work? Who knows? But so far nothing else has. We pay museums and galleries to act as stewards of our heritage assets. Who do we pay to look after our natural assets? If the answer is \"nobody\", what result would we expect? Valuing assets is one thing, but trading them is another. Monbiot's concerns about the prospect of a \"market\" in ecosystem services are well-founded. There is little doubt that if this government could find a way of doing it, it would but as Monbiot points out, it is almost impossible to do. Despite the risk of some bizarre kind of market emerging, valuing natural capital is still the right thing to do. Alastair McCapra Chief executive, Landscape Institute • Monbiot does well to compare the monetisation of ecosystem services to the enclosures of common land. What price the biosphere? Before we rush to financialise ecosystem services, or to counter this tendency with cries of horror about corporate greed, why not acknowledge that we don't yet know how ecosystem services – or biodiversity – actually work? Ecosystems have functional values in dimensions that science can measure. Surely the first thing to do is to demonstrate the dependence of all terrestrial life on ecosystems in a practical, measurable way that everyone can understand. It should then be obvious that humanity has a special responsibility in respect of the biosphere which cannot possibly be discharged by selling chunks of it to anyone. Michael Dunwell Staunton, Gloucestershire • George Monbiot is making a big mistake in arguing for a market-free world. Demand for access to fragile areas for tourism and extraction of resources, combined with scarcity, creates a market whether he likes it or not. The issue is whether it is shaped in a rational way and how it is regulated. The creation of incentives to invest in the conservation of biodiversity creates the possibility of a win for communities (investment in eco-tourism and its community infrastructure), for nature (price denotes real value creating a disincentive to destroy), and for investors (income from bonds over time). Those following the mythical path, denying the reality of market mechanisms, create obstacles to sustainable conservation. Jeremy Ross Ashtead, Surrey • When land is taken into private ownership, in effect duty-free land enclosure, the landowner levies a charge on all that that land produces. This means all who do not have free access to land but need to use it for whatever work they undertake have a portion of the fruits of their labour paid to someone who does not work. Monbiot reveals that the UK has a natural capital committee, an ecosystem markets task force which proposes to pay landowners, \"the providers of ecosystems\", for their services, either by the government or by \"users\". This would further increase the cost to society of almost everything, as most of our land is privately owned. As the value of the land is determined by the community, why not tax the landowners for the use of it – land value taxation. This would resolve many problems, particularly speculation by those holding land in disuse to increase its value. This would encourage them to either use the land more profitably, or make it available for others to do so. Mary Law St Albans, Hertfordshire • George Monbiot flits from being a hard-headed pragmatic green – pro-nuclear power – to dreamy romantic all too readily. His opposition to \"pricing nature\" seems very principled, the principle being of course that one day capitalism is going to up sticks and walk away. I disagree with him wholeheartedly, since capitalism seems perfectly capable of withstanding even the shocks it creates for itself. This must partly be explained by its readiness to exploit human or natural resources at less than their actual value. The greatest challenge \"greening\" society faces is to make us pay the actual value of what it is we consume, and if that means pricing rivers, so be it. But long before that we will perhaps develop an effective system of paying for the embedded carbon in our goods, the exploitation of child labour, the true cost of our waste and even for the legacy of our current tenancy of this planet. The task is to \"commonise\" the commons, and make us all pay our fair share for our use of it. If we did that, such abominations as the Alberta tar sands, as much a part of \"nature\" as a pretty stream, would be less attractive to the money grubbers. Colin Challen Scarborough, North Yorkshire • Anyone worried about George Monbiot's article on commodification of nature may like to read Antonio Tricario's piece about the global nature of financialisation or privatisation of common resources, in Red Pepper this month. And if you thought the free marketeers had learned a lesson from the financial crash of 2008, they are voracious in seeking new ways of making money. In other words they know the price of everything and value of nothing. It is sad that this began in Britain under Labour, but Nick Clegg perpetuated government policy when he addressed the Natural Capital summit in Rio in June advocating natural capital accounting. If you put a price tag on nature, you create a market.

Less likely than you might think","bodyText":"Angela Merkel isn't due to meet François Hollande for the first time until next week, but she must think she already knows him fairly well. Otherwise her senior diplomats wouldn't have confidently announced that the German and French head of state will find a \"pragmatic solution\" over the new fiscal pact, as they told Süddeutsche Zeitung last week. But then she would say that: pragmatism is what Merkel is all about. When not quipping for the 100th time that the new Franco-German alliance at the heart of European politics will no longer be known as \"Merkozy\" but as \"Merde\", the British press still tends to talk of continental diplomacy in terms of all-or-nothing-pacts and cloak-and-dagger intrigues. In fact, the German leader has long outlived the ideology-driven politics of the early 20th century: Merkel's leadership style in Europe has become a perfect lesson in the best and worst of Anglo-Saxon-style wait-and-see pragmatism. There are certainly some in Merkel's Christian Democrats who believe with their heart and soul in fiscal prudence and austerity, but Merkel isn't one of them. In fact, she changed to a pro-growth tune as soon as a Hollande victory looked likely back in April. We think Cameron does U-turns – Merkel does cartwheels. Her ministerial track record is stained with skid marks on military intervention in Afghanistan, state subventions, euro bailouts and, most spectacularly, nuclear power. What's surprising is that she manages to get away with it. In Sunday's local elections in Schleswig Holstein, her party lost 0.7%, while her coalition partner, the Free Democrats, lost 6.7%. Yet the German media was somehow tricked into writing it up as a defeat for the Social Democrats and Greens, who missed out on a complete majority thanks to the ongoing success of the Pirate Party, who are mopping up a large share of the protest vote. Next weekend's election on North Rhine-Westphalia is likely to paint a similar picture of a declining liberal party and a not-quite-strong-enough left. In fact, the rumour is that Merkel has already realised that Europe's current economic strategy isn't working, and that she may well be reaching for the escape button before it is too late. There's talk in Berlin of Merkel calling for an early election in September, ditching the Free Democrats and heading for a grand coalition with the Social Democrats: it would not only put her in a stronger position when the economic storm finally arrives in Germany, but also would enable her to make some concession to Hollande, such as a financial transaction tax, currently opposed by the liberals. Hollande's warning shot to France's easterly neighbour – \"it is not for Germany to decide for the rest of Europe\" – has led some to proclaim \"the end of austerity\". Whether he will actually live up to his rhetoric is another matter. In last week's TV debate, he made repeated references to the success of the German model; parliamentary president Jean-Marc Ayrault, who knows Germany well, is lined up for a leading ministerial role. What's more likely than a big bust-up is that the two will readjust and get on. Back in 1981 there were similar fears over a Franco-German fallout as Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt found himself faced with a newly elected Socialist François Mitterrand. A report by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), released this week, reveals Schmidt's frustration with Mitterrand then: \"Your means and your methods are such that we cannot harmonise them\". But Schmidt was soon voted out, and conservative Helmut Kohl and Mitterrand got on like a house on fire. One of the quirks of Franco-German relations is that people from opposite ends of the political spectrum often get on better than people from the same party. Still, Hollande had better be careful: he is facing a slippery negotiation partner. The danger for Europe is not that the French and German leaders won't get on, but that Merkel tricks Hollande into thinking he has won the argument while Europe continues on the same precarious path as before. • The original version of this article contained the statement 'Hollande's warning shot to France's westerly neighbour'.

I'm sure you will agree that such a perception is damaging.\" A Decc spokesman said: \"Decc's links with energy companies are entirely above board, working in partnership and sharing skills where appropriate, to bring about the secure, low-carbon energy future we all need. \"Ministers and officials also have close relationships with smaller, independent and newer players in the energy market, with environmental and academic organisations, and in all instances steps are taken to avoid any conflicts of interest.\" None of the staff on secondment in Decc work for renewable energy companies or non-governmental organisations, though a small number come from organisations such as the Carbon Trust, the Environment Agency and Cambridge University. Secondments also work in reverse, with civil servants going to work in the energy industry, such as a two-year secondment to Shell and another to Horizon Nuclear Power, a joint venture of E.ON and RWE npower that aims to build nuclear power stations in the UK. The Treasury has accommodated 209 secondments since January 2007, but refused to reveal the identity of employers supplying fewer than five staff. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) failed to list the secondments received back to that date. Decc declared 195 ministerial meetings with energy companies and their lobby groups and 17 with green campaign groups. The big six energy companies, which provide 99% of the energy used in UK homes, feature prominently, with 34 face-to-face meetings and a further seven with trade bodies representing their interests. Scottish Power, which uses almost double the amount of coal in producing its electricity compared with the industry average, has met Decc ministers most frequently – 10 times since May 2010 – in part due to the failed negotiations to build a carbon capture and storage demonstration plant. Centrica met ministers seven times, EDF and npower fives times each, E.ON four times and Scottish and Southern just three times. In addition, ministers met Shell nine times and BP eight times. \"Cash-strapped UK households are struggling with rocketing bills driven by the spiralling price of gas that the big six energy firms rely on to fuel their power stations,\" said Friends of the Earth executive director, Andy Atkins. \"It's time to break the cosy relationship between the government and energy giants, and help new British companies provide clean home-grown energy we can all afford.\" Lucas added: \"You need look no further than the covert collusion between BIS and Decc officials and the nuclear industry on a positive PR campaign in the days following Fukushima to see what can happen if this asymmetric relationship is left unchecked.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/blog/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-published-electricity-emissions","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-29T17:04:00Z","webTitle":"Energy bill published – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-published-electricity-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/blog/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-published-electricity-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill published – as it happened","bodyText":"I'm closing the liveblog now, but to quickly wrap up: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, made a statement to the Commons to herald the publication of the long-awaited energy bill. Details that were not otherwise already confirmed included: a commitment to use financial incentives to encourage energy efficiency; an exemption from low carbon levies for energy-intensive industries; and the lack of any decarbonisation targets for electricity generation until 2016. Tim Yeo, chair of the energy and climate change select committee, signalled that the government might face a cross-party rebellion in order to force an amendment to the bill so that it includes a decarbonisation target. Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow to Davey, suggested she would push for such an amendment. The energy industry largely welcomed the bill; environmental groups were far less enthusiastic, particularly over the issue of the decarbonisation target. There is still confusion and debate about the precise impact the bill will have on domestic energy bills. Expect this to run and run... Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavillions, has posted a statement on her website: In 2006, David Cameron said that ‘we need targets as well as technology’ to make the shift to a greener economy, yet he has allowed his chancellor to completely disregard the committee on climate change, his coalition partners, the renewables industry, NGOs and a raft of the UK's largest businesses by scrapping the 2030 decarbonisation target. Equally deplorable is the government’s refusal to support binding energy efficiency and renewables targets for 2030 that would deliver the longer term certainty that green investors are crying out for. Amendments are also needed to this bill to rule out a new dash for gas. Gas is the real threat to our energy bills, not green policies - it has been repeatedly shown that the UK’s ongoing dependence on expensive and polluting imported gas is what is forcing up energy bills. Yet ministers have failed to tackle this problem. This government’s apparent determination to keep the UK hooked on gas even in the face of the UN’s latest warnings on climate change also raises serious questions about who ministers are listening to over energy policy and the influence of pro-gas voices like Lord Howell. Here's a picture of Fuel Poverty Action Group protesters laying \"tombstones\" on the Treasury’s steps earlier today to illustrate \"its responsibility for fuel poverty deaths\". The protest has now come to an end. Here's a statement from the group: Protesters, including many pensioners and disabled people, occupied space outside the Treasury's front door and laid giant tombstones on the Treasury’s steps to symbolise George Osborne and the Treasury’s responsibility for fuel poverty deaths. One tombstone said: ‘George Osborne, your cuts kill’, one tombstone said: ‘Gas power = killer bills’ and another slogan said: ’24,000 winter deaths. Big Six profits up 700%’. They held banners that said: ‘Stop the great fuel robbery’, ‘Energy to meet our needs, not for corporate greed’ and ‘Justice for Pensioners’. The protesters demanded George Osborne let them ‘warm up’ inside the Treasury, chanting ‘Let us in!’ and saying that people who cannot afford to heat their homes should be allowed inside to keep warm. However, protesters were refused entry inside the building by a heavy police presence. Protesters accused George Osborne of leaving vulnerable people outside in the cold. Those present then held a ‘speak out’ session where people talked about their personal experiences of living in fuel poverty and pinned the blame on George Osborne and the Big Six energy companies. The protest ended with a march to parliament, with protesters chanting: ‘George Osborne, shame on you!’ and ‘Cold homes are a killer’. Milton Catelin, the CEO of the World Coal Association, says: Coal plays a vital role in the UK energy sector. Because of low coal prices, coal consumption in the UK actually increased by 28% in the first half of 2012 compared with the same period the year before. Disappointing that the UK energy bill doesn't acknowledge a fuel that contributes around 40% of the UK's electricity. The UK's emissions performance standard (EPS) will simply allow the construction of unabated natural gas plants, while prohibiting the construction of coal plants. It does not incentivise the deployment of high-efficiency low-emission coal-fired power plants, which are a necessary milestone towards CCS. CCS is needed on all fossil fuels – gas as well as coal. Unabated gas is not a solution to climate change. The EPS is also a concern from an energy security perspective. The expectation that unabated gas alone will provide the fossil fuel back-up to renewables is clearly high risk in terms of prices. While it is a positive step that the bill includes support for CCS via a feed-in tariff, governments and international institutions must support all low carbon technologies. There is significant potential to reduce CO2 emission through more efficient coal power plants. Average efficiency of electricity production from coal in the UK is 38%, compared to 45% that can be achieved today in power plants with state-of-the-art technology. Given that a one percentage point improvement in the efficiency of a conventional coal plant results in a 2-3% reduction in CO2 emissions, replacing old technologies with new ones at UK coal plants could result in 14%-21% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from coal-based electricity generation. Support of all low carbon technologies would also allow coal to continue to play its vital role in the UK energy mix and help alleviate the on-going issue of energy poverty in the UK. A conservative estimate is that 3,000 people die each year in the UK as a direct result of fuel poverty. The UK energy bill will increase the UK's dependence on natural gas, while limiting the role of coal which is a more affordable source of electricity. Philip Sellwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust, says: We welcome the commitment to energy efficiency by government and firmly believe that reducing electricity demand is the most cost-effective way of addressing the future of energy in the UK. Our ‘Powering the Nation’ study shows that the increase proliferation of electrical gadgets is a big factor in the increase in electricity demand. 40 years ago the UK averaged 12 appliances per household but today this is 40 appliances per household. On average, we are spending between £50 and £86 per year by powering electrical appliances we are not even actively using. It is unrealistic to ask people to stop using gadgets altogether. What we need is for all of us to start taking control of our energy use to realise the benefits of being more energy efficient in the home. Smart meters have a huge role to play in allowing us as consumers to understand their energy use and take control of how much we’re spending on our energy bills. A fundamental aspect of the smart meter roll-out is ongoing advice to ensure households fully understand how to use them and reap the benefits as a result. Essentially smart meters will only really work with smart people fully engaged. Following on from the last block, here's a statement from National Energy Action, the fuel poverty charity: The government's proposals will have clear and long lasting implications for domestic energy consumers. Despite a high level commitment that any costs incurred should present value for money, we are alarmed at the potential imposition of new and additional costs and, in particular, that low-income vulnerable consumers may end up picking up the tab for energy intensive users. This would be a clear contradiction of the principle that the polluter should pay. In addition, the government is aware that levies, paid for by energy consumers, disproportionately penalise the poorest households. The impacts of this type of policy can be mitigated through adequate and proportionate assistance; however, an independent review commissioned by the government recently warned that existing and future policies fall far short of what is required to protect the health and welfare of millions of households. We are therefore urging the government to face up to the impact of their proposals on low-income vulnerable households and to design and implement mitigating policies to minimise further hardship for these households. Here's Ed Davey speaking to ITN outside parliament earlier today... As the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin raises in a tweet (highlighted in the previous block), Davey announced today that the energy intensive industries, such as steel and cement factories, will be exempted from new low carbon costs. The tab for this will be picked up by domestic billpayers. As Damian Carrington points out in his article today, there is a growing perception that these industries are being overly cosseted by the government: There is little else in the bill that was not trailed last week, when the coalition simply kept its promise to support renewables but failed to fully end the crippling uncertainty facing the investors expected to commit the £200bn needed in coming decades. However, there was today the promise of yet more exemptions for energy intensive industries such as steel and cement. Make no mistake, these are important industries, both for building the UK's new energy system and for jobs. But many in the sector are carbon fat cats, who are rolling in billions of Euros of free carbon credits. \"They are past masters at special pleading,\" as Tim Yeo MP put it. So Davey will have to walk a fine line between protecting those industries and showering them with more subsidies. That is particularly important because, lest we forget, every penny of the money spent on our future energy system will come from me and you, through our energy bills. The good energy efficiency measures proposed today will - if they are delivered - shorten the odds on the great £200bn energy gamble. But the policy still relies too much on volatile gas to be the best bet for consumers and the climate. Dr Gordon Edge, director of policy at RenewableUK, has a comment piece on the Guardian's Comment is Free website: You don't have to be a whizz at maths to see that the [energy bill] targets will require a steep growth rate in renewables. It would be a remarkable trajectory, taking wind from a 1% share of the nation's electricity to around 25% in under 15 years, overtaking nuclear power in the process. But can this actually happen? Yes it really can, provided the industry (both in the UK and abroad) continues to make the strides it has been making over the past few years. At around 9.30pm on a cold day in mid-September last year, something extremely exciting happened in the UK (albeit completely unnoticeable to all but a few operators in the National Grid's control centre): wind power set a new all-time generation record of 3.98GW. \"System demand\" at the time was 34.9GW which meant that, for the first time in the UK's history, the wind was meeting more than 10% of our total electricity demand, nearly 12% actually. This probably doesn't strike you as a particularly high figure, but bear in mind that it wasn't until 2007 that wind power actually registered in the government's energy statistics at all, coming in at a rather paltry 0.9%. Nevertheless, that was also the year in which the largest windfarms were given the status of \"major power producers\" by the then Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Installed capacity (the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated by a technology) is 10 times greater today than eight years ago, in 2004, and that kind of growth isn't too bad over a period in which, for the greater part, the country has been mired in economic difficulties. Tim Yeo MP, chairman of the energy and climate change committee, has just commented on the energy bill: I welcome the government’s response to my committee’s report and am pleased that there have been some significant changes to the bill as a result. However, there is still room for improvement. It is disappointing that Decc is only launching its consultation on electricity efficiency today, when my committee has been calling for stronger action on efficiency for many years. I am pleased that ministers have seen sense on having a single counterparty to guarantee new energy contracts, but if the Treasury wants to deliver the best deal for consumers it should use the government’s triple AAA rating to back the contracts directly. This would lower the risk for investors and reduce capital costs, keeping the overall bill for energy investment down. I am also concerned that National Grid will face conflicts of interest in its role as delivery body for these reforms. I believe this role should be performed by a new, independent, not-for-profit company. Graham Meeks, director of the Combined Heat &amp; Power Association: While we applaud the government for its bold steps in seeking to secure investment in new low carbon generation, the energy bill does not provide the simplicity necessary to support the continued growth of the decentralised energy sector. The expansion of the small scale feed-in tariff, as recommended by the energy and climate change committee, is the simplest way to provide that access for combined heat and power and renewables generation. Harry Huyton, the RSPB's head of climate change policy: Mr Davey’s claim would be considerably more credible if the bill had introduced a clear commitment to near-zero carbon electricity by 2030. Without this, the UK’s nascent renewable energy industry continues to operate with considerable uncertainty that has been fuelled by high-profile rows within the coalition about the role of renewable energy versus fossil fuels. The stakes couldn’t be higher; climate change threatens to drive species to extinction across the world, and this year’s extreme weather at home and abroad is a stark reminder of the impact that unbridled climate change can have on people and wildlife. Juliet Davenport, CEO of Good Energy: The bill is a step forward in delivering more large scale renewable generation and that’s obviously a good thing. We also welcome that the government has indicated that it’s willing to listen to suppliers on how these proposals will work in practice. But its continued inability to look beyond the need for larger projects is disheartening. To create a more competitive market, Decc must be more proactive in encouraging independently owned, decentralised generation, ideally through extending the current Feed-in Tariff scheme. Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust: The inclusion in the energy bill of a levy cap of up to £7.6bn a year, in today’s money, by 2020 is welcome. It should provide far more certainty that new projects moving from their development to construction phase will have adequate revenues. However, until the detail of the strike price for the various technologies has been agreed and the relationship between the price, the capacity and the total cap is clarified it is too premature to fully welcome this measure... The news that the coalition government has decided to defer to 2016 the inclusion of a carbon target out to 2030 is disappointing as it misses an important opportunity to send an immediate long term signal to the market that the overall policy to decarbonise the electricity sector is set. Overall the energy bill, assuming strike prices are published quickly and are set adequately to generate commercial returns, will have done enough in the short-term to bank and re-boot the low carbon energy sector but it could have done so much more. Neera Sharma, Barnardo’s assistant director of policy: The government must... Hold energy companies to account for ensuring that the poorest families are on the lowest tariffs available and that prices for pre-payment meters are brought down to the same rates as online tariffs. Ensure help is available to help drive down the energy bills of the poorest families, for example by using money gained from carbon taxes to invest in a major programme to make homes super energy efficient Bring forward the requirements on landlords (contained in the Energy Act 2011) to make their rental properties more energy efficient so that all families living in substandard accommodation can benefit from energy efficiency improvements. James Vaccaro, head of corporate and market development at Triodos Bank: There are many clarifications to the levy control framework which are essential for supporting future investment. Whereas it sets out the broad brush strokes for a policy, there are still worrying gaps where the future “devils in the detail” could creep in over the next few months. As a major investor in renewable energy, we’re keen for rapid progress to be made so that we can get on with the job of supporting more renewable energy generation and green infrastructure. In particular, the lack of a transparent framework for conducting future pricing reviews and consultations could leave the industry with the prospect of future political uncertainty. This could have (and still can) be dealt with in the months to come, and may be even more significant than a decarbonisation target: e.g. if there was a truly stable framework that investors could rely upon, then the green infrastructure that we need would be built quicker and cheaper. Such a mechanism, which goes beyond measures such as the carbon floor price, needs to support a range of promising new renewable energy technologies, whose deployment prices are likely to fall rapidly as their industries grow – but that will only happen if the government gets the next bit right. The UK Energy Research Centre has published a detailed response to the energy bill on its website: It will be crucial to avoid a situation where the headroom in levy control framework is taken up prematurely with contracts for power plants that do not get built; thereby crowding out other projects that fail due to lack of public finance. ...The absence of a 2030 electricity decarbonisation target in the bill may not persuade investors of the need for new manufacturing assets in the UK, as there is a risk that these could be stranded after 2020 once the current targets have been met. If low-carbon investors do not feel sufficiently secure in the UK actually to build their factories and their supply chains here, they may continue to source a large proportion of low-carbon equipment from overseas. The Financial Times has a new report on the publication of the energy bill with the headline: \"Industry friendly energy bill unveiled\" Fiona Harvey, the Guardian's environment correspondent, has just asked a question at the energy bill press conference being held at Decc. She asked whether John Hayes, the new energy minister, approved of any onshore wind. He refused to answer. James Murray, editor of BusinessGreen, believes Ed Davey has \"played a very savvy hand\": In short, investment in clean energy has never looked more attractive. The business case for investing in clean energy directly or sourcing clean energy from suppliers looks increasingly compelling for financial, as well as environmental reasons. It is little wonder the bill has been welcomed by the CBI, EnergyUK, RenewableUK, and the EEF, just as it is no surprise green groups will argue it does not go far enough... Caveats aside, the energy industry and the green economy have been waiting decades for a policy landscape as clear and progressive as this. It has taken longer than it should, mistakes have been made along the way, and the government will almost certainly take a kicking over the impact on energy bills, but if you consider the long term vision contained in this bill then Davey and co deserve some plaudits. John Alker of the UK Green Building Council emails to say he's noticed an omission in the small print that is of potential concern: A scan and search of the 100+ page document reveals no mention whatsoever of display energy certificates, currently driving energy efficiency improvements in public sector buildings. This is bizarre really – firstly because they are doing a good job in public buildings. Secondly, there is a big lobby to roll them out to commercial buildings, and they will be essential if we are going to pay people to use less energy – because how on earth will that be measured without some sort of assessment tool? The Labour party has now posted a transcript of Caroline Flint's response to Ed Davey in the Commons on its website: I make no bones about it – we support a clear decarbonisation target in this bill. From what I read in this morning’s papers, so do many honourable members on the government’s own benches, including the chair of the select committee. And when the time comes, we will work with colleagues across the house, to put a decarbonisation target into this bill. Guy Newey, head of environment and energy at Policy Exchange: The subsidy lobby has won. The energy bill will lead to more and more decisions being made by the government, rather than in the market. This will increase the unnecessarily high level of subsidies that are going to low carbon technologies such as offshore wind. An EU-wide carbon price would allow different low carbon technologies to compete, which is the best way of going greener as cheaply as possible. Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK: This energy bill is a big and positive step forward. In its detail it must provide sufficient clarity and confidence for investors over the direction the UK is taking on energy policy. The capacity market proposals will mean that gas power stations will be there, not just to keep the lights on while the new nuclear power stations and renewables are being built, but also for the longer term future. This means that the huge investment will now start being made in our energy infrastructure and this will create jobs and help economic recovery. At the same time, a focus on affordability for households and for businesses of all sizes, now and during these changes, is essential. The energy industry will be doing its part in both providing free and subsidised insulation and particularly assisting the elderly and vulnerable. We will be working closely with consumer groups, business groups and those who are big energy users as the bill goes through its processes, as well as government, all political parties and the regulator. Ray Noble, PV specialist at the Solar Trade Association: Solar could readily deliver a third of the UK’s power supply, using south-facing roofs and facades alone. This technology will be massive. Furthermore solar puts the power to generate directly in the hands of millions, not the few. Decc and its electricity market reform agenda now need to fully recognise the major role that solar power will play in transforming our electricity markets. The approach so far has been top down. Solar power means a bottom-up energy revolution and any government serious about breaking open the electricity market to much greater consumer choice and competition should be right behind us. Alistair Smith, chair of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers’ power division: Although the majority of measures being announced today are positive, and should enable us to meet our 2020 EU renewables obligation, the lack of an emissions target for 2030 leads to longer term uncertainty on clean energy investments. In the absence of this clear target we will likely see a ‘dash for (unabated) gas’ and it effectively removes any legislative incentive to develop carbon and capture and storage technology for gas-fired powered stations in the medium-term. “What is clear is that whatever technologies the UK ends up relying on to meet energy demand, energy prices are set to rise. The UK has enjoyed 20 years of cheap energy which has lead to complacent energy use. People must adjust to the fact that if they want to keep energy costs down they must adjust their behaviour. Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association: The devil will be in the detail, which we have yet to fully examine. However, if the new regime is implemented sensitively, consumers and green generators should both win. Electricity customers will only pay what is necessary to move the UK towards a more sustainable and secure energy future. That’s because, with these new contracts, if the price of electricity increases, the amount of subsidy required can fall. Generators should get a stable price, provided they achieve the fair market price for their electricity. That’s why it’s essential we have a route to market which guarantees this. We can’t afford to be complacent, however. It is vital that confidence in the policy framework is established quickly given the investment hiatus we face. There is still much work to do, to translate the legislation into clear and effective policy. We look forward to working closely with Decc to ensure our members can have full confidence in the new framework as quickly as possible. Alan Raymant, chief operating officer of Horizon Nuclear Power: We’re extremely pleased to see publication of the energy bill. This process is critical in allowing developers to progress projects which will provide the secure, sustainable and affordable energy which the UK needs. Matthew Spencer, Green Alliance director: This is a timely and vital bill to ensure we get a secure, low carbon energy system. Unfortunately, this good bill is let down by two deficiencies. Firstly, it doesn’t create a market for energy saving to reduce the cost of new energy production. Secondly, by failing to establish a decarbonisation target it risks losing thousands of jobs on offer in wind turbine manufacturing because investors don’t have certainty about the direction of UK energy policy. We hope these issues will be addressed in amendments to the bill. The energy bill press conference at Decc has now started. I'm told that Greg Barker is sitting between Ed Davey and John Hayes... Here's a video recorded last Friday by Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, explaining what the energy bill will mean for consumers... Tom Burke, the environmental consultant and former director of the Green Alliance, has written a comment piece for the Guardian today arguing that, despite common thinking, the energy bill is actually a victory for Davey and the Liberal Democrats, as opposed to George Osbourne and the Treasury: The government is now explicitly committed to meeting its obligations under the renewables directive. And it has provided the money to do so through increased cap in the levy control framework. That means that by 2020 just over 30% of our electricity will come from renewable sources. This is a significant defeat for the Treasury, which has long sought a way to avoid meeting this commitment. It means that by 2020 a lot of relatively cheap renewable electricity will have been contracted for an as-yet unspecified period, but which is likely to extend beyond 2030. John Hayes, the wind-sceptic energy minister, may think he has killed onshore wind, but he will now discover that money talks louder than ministers. Guy Shrubsole, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, has emailed to say he's spotted something interesting: Trawling through the energy bill’s small print, it looks like the government is trying to dilute still further its already weak commitments on cleaning up the power sector. Up until now, DECC have said they were looking at the power sector decarbonising to 100g of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour by 2030. But today, DECC have snuck out documents saying they will be ‘updating their analysis’ to anticipate emissions being up to 200g/kWh by 2030. They’d already moved the goalposts - now they’re moving them again. It’s a total cop-out that will hurt the climate and tie us into an expensive dash for gas.” The relevant doc is here Of course, the Committee on Climate Change - which was set up to advise government on setting carbon budgets - recommends (pdf) a target of 50g CO2e/kWh by 2030. Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth’s executive director: This Energy Bill will lock the nation into increasingly expensive gas, condemn cash-strapped households to rising fuel bills and threatens the nation’s targets for tackling climate change. Ministers must nail the lie that green policies are behind soaring fuel bills – it’s the rocketing price of gas that’s overwhelmingly responsible for the misery inflicted on consumers. MPs must support an amendment for a decarbonisation target to give businesses confidence to invest in clean energy to deliver new jobs and investment and a power system we can all afford. Paul King, CEO of the UK Green Building Council: After some major setbacks for its ‘greenest government ever’ claims, today’s announcements are much more encouraging than many – including ourselves – have been expecting. It’s great to see government bringing forward innovative proposals to reduce energy demand, but of course, it will be critical that they learn lessons from the feed-in tariff debacle and the carbon reduction commitment to ensure that this is done in the right way and provides the certainty industry needs to invest. Just as we need to encourage consumers and providers to make the most of the green deal, we need to rally behind the government’s efforts to reduce businesses’ energy demand too. Research from McKinsey cited by DECC suggests that a 26% reduction in energy use is possible by 2030 and we need to see this as a realistic target to cut demand, save money and carbon as well as helping us keep the lights on. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, and Dr Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group (a joint statement): The energy bill will not complete its passage in this parliamentary term and carbon reduction targets and funding beyond 2020 will be decided in 2016, long after the government has completed negotiations on the price to be paid for nuclear energy. This price will be well above the market price for electricity, and energy consumers will be required to pay the difference (via ‘Contracts for Difference’) through a levy on their bills. The impact of these contracts would be to shift the very great economic risk of building new nuclear facilities from the nuclear corporations to consumers. With the stroke of a pen, the government is attempting to disguise a ‘subsidy’, under which the corporate liability for new nuclear cost over-runs is simply passed on to the UK consumer. And if new build in Finland and France is anything to go by, these cost over-runs will be very great. In order to pay for new nuclear by the time it comes online, the subsidy budget will have to double to about £15bn and would have to be financed from additional levies from consumers. But new nuclear plants cannot be online before 2020 the time when funding under the current bill is no longer quantified. This raises two questions: will renewables face a ‘fiscal cliff’ post-2020 because all the budget for additional budget post-2020 will already have been committed to nuclear; and is new nuclear the most cost-effective way to meet our climate change targets? Michael Ware, a BDO corporate finance partner specialising in renewables: The government needs to realise that the UK is just a rainy island off the coast of Europe and tariff and incentive schemes to encourage investment in renewable power are pretty universal across Europe. Therefore, if we don’t provide clarity and certainty investors will simply take their money elsewhere. The energy bill is a big step forward in this process and will provide some much needed certainty to the industry. There is a clear message that a very significant proportion of the UK’s electricity will be generated from renewable sources by 2020. There is still a great deal of detail on the electricity market reform to be revealed, however, it should provide investors with sufficient confidence to support investments in the renewable sector in the short-medium term. In particular, the feed in tariff contracts for difference model should be attractive to pension funds as, unlike the ROC scheme, the model ensures stable returns and incentives to generate. Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has just posted a blog welcoming Davey's promise to focus on energy efficiency measures: As Ed Davey points out today, even a modest 10% reduction in 2030 means five fewer power stations need to be built, nearly five million tonnes of carbon dioxide is saved, and £4bn is cut from bills. The ideas in the proposal are smart: financial incentives to install more efficient equipment and to guarantee keeping the lights on by allowing industry to commit to cutting energy use, not just by generating more. Targeting the replacement of old, inefficient appliances is a huge opportunity, but has proved tough to achieve in the past, such as when Gordon Brown as prime minister wanted to cut the VAT on efficient appliances only to be thwarted by European Union rules. The voluntary schemes the coalition is consulting - better information, prizes - would be more convincing if the coalition had not slashed the budget of the Energy Savings Trust, which does exactly this work. John Cridland, CBI director-general: Energy-intensive manufacturing is finally getting its place in the sun today, by the exemption from necessary new energy costs. This is vital for such companies to play a key part in our low-carbon economy and it is good news that the government has listened to our calls to build in support at this early stage, which will ensure we reap the full economic benefits at the earliest opportunity. Equally important is the welcome boost the bill gives to investor certainty. It will be crucial for investors to see the momentum kept up in parliament so that the bill can get onto the statute books as quickly as possible. The next vital debate is to decide how to improve energy efficiency and deliver real benefits to the economy. The current policy landscape is too complex, so we will look forward to seeing how today’s electricity demand reduction proposals can move us towards a simpler, more strategic approach. Joss Garman, Greenpeace's political director : There is a gaping hole in the energy bill in the shape of a 2030 decarbonisation target. Billions of pounds of investment rest on this target being made law. Without it, there is serious risk of an investment vacuum after 2020, and of jobs and money being lost to our economic rivals. “The good news is, Conservative chair of the energy committee Tim Yeo looks set to fight for an amendment to the bill that would offer low-carbon investors certainty through to 2030. Greenpeace will be working closely with MPs across all parties to push for the amendment. Tony Ward, power &amp; utilities partner at Ernst &amp; Young: It may not be until autumn 2013 before this bill reaches the statute book, so maintaining confidence in its safe passage will be vital. As ever, details remain to be ironed out or fully articulated. It is inevitable that in the coming days questions will be raised about specific elements, for example exactly how the CfD (Contracts for Difference) counter-party will operate, whether the capacity market will actually be deployed, and if so whether it will simply reward existing assets or incentivise new-build? Government and industry should work closely together to deliver on these details. We should also recognise that many other vital activities are running in parallel with the bill's passage, such as the determination of the strike price for the first nuclear CfD to support Hinkley Point C, and the ongoing focus to ensure that the planning regime does not act as a barrier to energy infrastructure development. Nick Molho, head of energy policy at WWF-UK: Today’s energy bill is a unique opportunity for the government to finally speak with one voice in support of the renewables sector. David Cameron must now put an end to months of government infighting which have badly damaged investment confidence in one of the UK’s few sectors of economic growth. The ultimate test for the bill will be through strong amendments on energy efficiency and a decarbonisation target that hold the government to their commitments. Consistent political messages are now more important than ever in boosting investor confidence. Keith Parker, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association: The bill provides much needed investment certainty. A major nuclear new build programme will lead to substantial industrial and employment benefits – including considerable opportunities for the UK nuclear supply chain and a boost for UK manufacturing and construction. Jeff Chapman, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association: The publication of this bill will give a good deal more confidence to those businesses that are developing the UK’s first CCS projects and laying the foundation of a world leading industry. Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK: This bill is crucial in setting the investment framework for the next 20 years and ensuring that we can build on our current world lead in offshore wind and marine technologies, and guarantee clean domestic power and tens of thousands of green jobs”. Clare McNeil, senior research fellow at thinktank IPPR: The government is right that going green mustn’t mean going out of business. Energy intensive industries are particularly vulnerable to increases in energy bills but blanket exemptions and handouts are not the answer. We need smarter policies that offer incentives for innovation to reduce the reliance on carbon in industries like steel, cement, paper and pulp, ceramics and glass. As Davey takes questions from other MPs, the Department of Energy and Climate Change has now placed on its website a transcript of his Commons statement as well as additional all-important details. A snap summary of Davey's statement: Gas is a \"vital\" part of our energy mix, but we will ensure \"full protection of the environment\" New coal plants will only be built with carbon capture and storage (CCS) Consumer bills are \"my greatest concern\", despite some \"recent misleading reports in the media\" Energy efficiency measures will be placed \"front and centre\". 15m smart meters installed by 2019 The energy bill is \"good for consumers, the economy and the planet\" Caroline Flint, Davey's Labour shadow, is now responding... Davey (with John Hayes sitting by his side - to the amusement of some MPs) is now speaking in the Commons... Here's how some of the papers have been reporting the energy bill's publication this morning... The Independent has, perhaps, the most interesting angle. \"Pro-green Tory and Lib Dem MPs consider rebellion over Coalition Energy Bill,\" says its headline. The article says that the lack of any decarbonisation target in the bill means a \"cross party group of MPs led by the members of the Energy and Climate Change Committee are considering tabling an amendment to the Bill to re-introduce the commitment\". Speaking to The Independent Tim Yeo, the Conservative chairman of the Energy Committee said such an amendment was a “real possibility”. “I think it would most likely be done at report stage in the New Year but I think there could be a worthwhile debate about amending the Bill to introduce a target range for emissions from the energy sector by 2030,” he said. Liberal Democrat sources said Government ministers would almost certainly be whipped to vote against any amendment. However they added that the 2030 target had been agreed as policy by the party’s conference in October and backbenchers might be free to support it. The Telegraph has the headline: \"UK energy investment 'in limbo for a decade', says Lord Oxburgh.\" It reports on an interview with the former Shell chairman on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. The Guardian carries a comment piece by Ditlev Engel, the CEO of Vestas Wind Systems AS: The failure to establish a firm 2030 power sector carbon cap prolongs uncertainty for the supply chain where investment time horizons extend well beyond 2020. This is a significant missed opportunity. It is, however, helpful that the need for a 2030 power sector target has been recognised, as has the importance of the energy mix to facilitating the 2050 carbon targets at least cost. Wind will have a huge role to play in delivering both of these. The Financial Times has the headline: \"Energy bill key to investment, says EDF.\" Ed Davey has not started to make his statement yet in the Commons, but you can watch live here or here when he does begin. Today, after months of speculation, politicking and lobbying, the coalition government finally publishes its energy bill. At 11.30am, the energy secretary Ed Davey will make a statement to the House of Commons, followed by an hour-long press conference at 1pm. (You, too, might have spotted that it happens to coincide with another long-awaited publication.) We will bring you all the details, analysis and reaction as it comes in, but here's what we already know from previous announcements: Energy firms will be allowed to triple the amount of money they add to customers' bills to pay for renewable power, nuclear and other environmental measures. The Treasury has capped this at a total of £7.6bn up to 2020. But there is still fierce debate about what this will mean for average household energy bills. The government says it will add about £80 a year by 2020, on average. The legislation will not, says Davey, rule out future abated gas plants or the exploitation of shale gas reserves through \"fracking\" in areas such as Lancashire. There will be no electricity decarbonisation target for 2030, to the dismay of many environmental groups. A decision on this has been pushed back until 2016, after the next general election. The government has also announced this morning that \"energy intensive industries\" will be exempted from additional costs arising from new long term ‘contracts for difference’ designed to bring on investment in low carbon power plant such as nuclear power stations and wind farms. It said: \"The scope of the exemption is currently being considered by DECC and BIS, who will run a consultation in 2013 once the proposed exemption has been further developed. The exemption will require state aid clearance from the European Commission.\" And on the day the energy bill is announced, the government has also announced that \"financial incentives\" will be used to \"dramatically reduce electricity demand across the whole UK economy\". This includes payments \"for each kWh saved through energy saving measures installed such as energy efficient lighting\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/may/20/iaea-visit-iran-nuclear-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-20T12:48:09Z","webTitle":"IAEA chief to visit Iran for nuclear talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/20/iaea-visit-iran-nuclear-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/20/iaea-visit-iran-nuclear-talks","fields":{"headline":"IAEA chief to visit Iran for nuclear talks","bodyText":"The head of the UN nuclear watchdog will arrive in Tehran on Monday morning for a day of negotiations with the Iranian government on its co-operation with the agency, at the start of a week that is likely to be critical to an international effort to defuse tensions in the Gulf. Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will hold talks with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and senior officials from the country's nuclear programme, with the aim of reaching a breakthrough agreement on inspections of sites and access to scientists suspected of having been involved in work on nuclear weapons. Two days later, Jalili will meet the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton, and senior diplomats from six world powers – the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany – in Baghdad to discuss other confidence-building measures, including limits on Iranian uranium enrichment. The degree of progress at both meetings is likely to have an important bearing on the level of tension surrounding Iran's nuclear programme, the likelihood of an Israeli military strike against Iranian nuclear sites, and global oil prices. Amano's trip to Tehran is the first by an IAEA director general since his predecessor, Mohamed ElBaradei, visited in 2009. If the Japanese diplomat succeeds in securing an agreement on the IAEA investigation into alleged Iranian work on nuclear weapons, it would vindicate his tough approach to Tehran in the face of criticism that he is too closely aligned with the west. \"The focus of the visit will be on the issue of a framework. We hope the two sides can reach an agreement and draw up a new framework to answer [IAEA] questions and clear up ambiguities,\" the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, told local media at the weekend. The Iranian government has insisted on establishing such a framework before allowing IAEA inspectors to visit sensitive sites such as the Parchin military base, where the agency wants to investigate intelligence reports that Iranian technicians tested high-explosive components of a nuclear warhead. Iran has denied ever having conducted development work on nuclear weapons. The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington published satellite photos this month showing recent activity that could be an attempt to clean up the Parchin site. The IAEA chief inspector, Herman Nackaerts, who will be accompanying Amano to Tehran, has been reluctant to enter into any agreement with Iran that would tie the hands of his inspectors in conducting their investigation. Amano's decision to fly to Tehran to try to seal an agreement suggests he believes a compromise can be found. Diplomats who have followed the long history of negotiations with Tehran since its uranium enrichment and heavy water programmes were first revealed in 2002 point out that a previous agreement on a IAEA \"work plan\" to investigate allegations of weapons work fell apart in 2008 before inspectors could interview key nuclear scientists. An IAEA agreement in Tehran could have a positive impact on the Baghdad talks on Wednesday. The negotiations between Jalili, Ashton and the six-nation group will seek to build on a similar meeting in Istanbul last month, where Jalili agreed in principle to negotiate over Iran's nuclear programme. Western diplomats hope the Baghdad talks will make progress towards a confidence-building deal by which Iran would stop making 20% enriched uranium, a more concentrated material than the fuel used in modern power stations, which is closer to the level of purity needed for making weapons. In return, the west would provide fuel for a medical research reactor in Tehran and provide advice and equipment to improve safety standards at that reactor and at a nuclear power station at Bushehr, on the Gulf coast. Western officials said Tehran appeared to be keen to strike a bargain as it was faced with broad and damaging sanctions, including an EU oil embargo, the threat of Israeli military action and the substantial weakening of its only significant ally in the region, the Assad regime in Damascus. \"These negotiations could, if the parties have a real and serious will [for them to succeed], and on condition that realism reigns, open the road to a compromise which would permit on one hand the alleviation of the concerns of the west, while on the other hand bring Iran the assurances it needs on the pursuit of nuclear activities and uranium enrichment on its soil for completely civil purposes,\" the Iranian ambassador to Paris, Ali Ahani, wrote in Le Monde on Friday, in what appeared part of a public relations offensive before the Baghdad talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/24/japan-pm-race-naoto-kan-quits","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-24T09:55:56Z","webTitle":"Japan readies for new PM race as Naoto Kan quits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/japan-pm-race-naoto-kan-quits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/24/japan-pm-race-naoto-kan-quits","fields":{"headline":"Japan readies for new PM race as Naoto Kan quits","bodyText":"Japan is expected to get its seventh leader in six years early next week, after the prime minister, Naoto Kan, confirmed he would resign in the midst of the country's worst crisis since the second world war. Kan, who is battling record-low approval ratings over the aftermath of the 11 March tsunami, had promised to step down once parliament has passed a series of bills, including those to fund rebuilding and promote renewable energy. One of those bills has passed and the other two expected to win parliamentary support this week, paving the way for the governing Democratic party of Japan [DPJ] to elect a new leader on Monday. Whoever wins the contest will be approved as prime minister the following day as leader of the largest party in the lower house. The most likely successor emerged on Monday, when Kan's former foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, announced he would run. The 49-year-old, who remains popular despite resigning in early March over a minor funding scandal, could run against his DPJ ally, the finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the trade minister, Banri Kaieda. At least three other MPs are considering running, Japanese media reported, including the agriculture minister, Michihiko Kano, a veteran politician who is seen as dull but dependable. Kan said on Wednesday thathe would resign as DPJ president if the two outstanding bills were passed, as expected, this Friday. \"Then, when a new [party] leader is chosen, I will quit as prime minister,\" he told a parliamentary panel. Kan finds himself in the unusual position of leading a popular movement against nuclear power following the Fukushima Daiichi crisis, but also of presiding over a deeply unpopular government. A Kyodo News poll on Sunday showed approval for Kan's cabinet at 15.8%; yet in the same survey, more than 75% of respondents said they backed his plan to scrap nuclear power. Of the leading candidates, Maehara is closest to Kan on energy policy, saying Japan should phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years. In 2009, the DPJ ended more than 50 years of almost unbroken conservative rule promising to revive the economy, shift Japan's foreign policy focus from the US to Asia and implement an ambitious spending programme targeted at struggling families. But the left-of-centre party has been criticised for dropping key election pledges, including the introduction of means-testing for child allowances, with Kan criticised for his handling of the nuclear disaster and humanitarian emergency in areas hit by the tsunami. Whoever succeeds him faces a surging yen that is hurting the country's manufacturing base, the ongoing nuclear crisis, the reconstruction of the north-eastern coast, surging social security costs and a public debt more than twice the size of the economy. He will also have to reach a deal with opposition parties to pass legislation through the upper house, where no single party has overall control. Maehara, a defence hawk who has warned against China's military buildup, said his priorities were to beat deflation and unite the country as it attempts to recover from March's triple disaster. \"We need to stand beside the disaster victims and overcome this national catastrophe together,\" Maehara, 49, told party supporters. \"Many people are disappointed by the current state of politics… we need to restore the public's faith in politics. Allow me to take the lead in building a new Japan.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/may/23/italy-red-brigade-scaremongering","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-23T10:09:47Z","webTitle":"Violence in Italy does not signal the return of the Red Brigade | Leonardo Clausi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/23/italy-red-brigade-scaremongering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/may/23/italy-red-brigade-scaremongering","fields":{"headline":"Violence in Italy does not signal the return of the Red Brigade","bodyText":"It was a moment straight out of an old television documentary: only it was coming from a 2012 Italian court. Last Tuesday in Milan, during the appeal hearing of 13 suspected members of a group linked to the New Red Brigades, one of the main suspects, Alfredo Davanzo shouted: \"This is the right moment, ahead with the revolution, long live the revolution!\" Davanzo had just been asked by a journalist what he made of the recent kneecapping of Roberto Adinolfi, the chief executive of the nuclear power company Ansaldo Nucleare, by two masked men near Genoa on Monday 7 May. There is no established link between the men on trial, arrested in 2007, and the perpetrators, who define themselves as anarchists. The hearing was taking place after the Cassazione court overturned the previous sentence. Another defendant, Claudio Latino, said: \"Violence [is] inevitable and strategically necessary. We don't love violence, or have a romantic idea of it, but it is inevitable. No group of dominators has ever relinquished power peacefully\". He concluded, his voice quivering with emotion: \"Either communism or destruction. Death to imperialism and freedom to the people\". The defendants have \"politically refused\" their lawyers. There were quite a few young radical left sympathisers in court who applauded such slogans. Some of them pulled off their black sweaters to reveal white T-shirts with red letters spelling out the word \"solidarity\". Just before the judge had them expelled, they demanded the freeing of the prisoners, raising their clenched fists. However, it is worth stressing that this group call themselves Partito Comunista Politico-Militare (Political-Military Communist party). Calling them \"New Red Brigades\" is more of a journalistic cliche, which gives the phenomenon an overdramatic tone: as if, at any moment, the whole country could be plunged back into darkness. The Brigate Rosse was absorbed by pop culture long ago . Didn't Joe Strummer, after all, wear their T-shirt back in 1977? Italy is going through a volatile moment. The severe debt crisis, growing unemployment and recession serve as a background (or, more likely, as a direct cause) to a string of confrontational events: a clash between protesters and police over the highly controversial plans for a high-speed rail network (known as TAV) between Italy and France; a chain of suicides of a number of entrepreneurs whose enterprises fell victim to the economic storm; or the series of attacks on the offices of Equitalia, a tax collection agency. And now the bomb attack in Brindisi that claimed the life of a teenage student last Saturday, even if several investigators are now regarding it as the act of a \"lone wolf\". All of this not long after the Italian public emphasised its disinterest in politics by giving Berlusconi the longest office mandate in its history. In the 70s, the Red Brigade attempted an \"attack at the heart of the state\", to quote a famous line from one of their manifestos. An attack that took the shape of countless actions: robberies, kidnappings, the execution of company managers, judges, trade unionist leaders, politicians, even journalists. The apex was the notorious kidnapping, and later killing, of the Christian Democratic leader and then prime minister Aldo Moro in 1978. In the 1990s and at the start of the new millennium, there were further attacks, claiming the lives of government advisers who wanted to reform the labour market. But Mario Monti's Italy is not Moro's: unlike 30 years ago, when the workers' movement and the communist trade unions offered fertile ground for revolutionary recruits, today it is the existence of unionism itself that is at stake. Neither does the powerful Communist party exist any more, which the terrorists were trying to outflank. And the sensationalist portrayal of the phenomenon in the Italian media has had a negative effect in more ways than one: on the one hand it gives the group's activities an overwhelming psychological impact; on the other, it gives the authorities an excellent excuse to turn the screw on personal liberties by maximising social control and neutralising dissent. Let's not forget what happened in July 2001 at the G8 meeting in Genoa: a savage and brutal repression of protest by the police, defined by Amnesty International as \"the most serious suspension of democratic rights in a western country after the second world war\". Such panic-mongering about the return of political terrorism in Italy seems, well, politically terroristic. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/feb/28/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T20:37:25Z","webTitle":"Japan's nuclear disaster: a long half-life | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/28/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/28/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Japan's nuclear disaster: a long half-life","bodyText":"As the people of Pripyat, a once bustling Soviet city built for the workers of Chernobyl, will tell you, evacuation from a nuclear disaster is a one-way ticket. Nearly 26 years later, time is frozen. The hammer-and-sickles still hang from the lamp-posts as they did on the day the town's residents were told to get on the buses. A similar fate awaits many of the 80,000 evacuated a year ago from Fukushima. The Japanese government is raising hopes of an early return to the evacuation zone, and there are parts of villages to which former residents could move back this spring – if they wanted to. But life without neighbours, or the region's traditional livestock and fishing industries, would be a shadow of its former self. Much of this area – particularly towns like Okuma, near the perimeter of the stricken nuclear plant – is as doomed as Pripyat. As our reporter found out when he was allowed in on Tuesday, groceries sit untouched on the shelves of a convenience store, cars abandoned in a supermarket car park. The only signs of life are the beeping monitors alerting visitors to the invisible foe. It could take decades for cleanup workers to get all the fuel out of the reactors – if indeed they ever succeed. The world is in awe of the speed with which Japan cleared the rubble from the tsunami that devastated its north-east coastline, but it is now clear that the nuclear disaster could have been an even bigger catastrophe than the tsunami that triggered it. Had the Fukushima Daiichi power plant been abandoned, as the company who ran it, Tepco, wanted to do, it could have unleashed a chain reaction of plant meltdowns that could have resulted in the evacuation of Tokyo. This is the doomsday scenario, but according to a leaked report of the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation – a team of university professors, lawyers and journalists who spent six months investigating Japan's response to the triple meltdown at the plant – it could all too easily have happened. Tepco's senior management emerges worst of all from this report. The former prime minister Naoto Kan, who was distrustful of Tepco and relied on advisers who had no experience of an emergency of this magnitiude, comes off slightly better. The unsung hero is the plant manager Masao Yoshida, who kept on injecting seawater into the stricken reactors. With just two of its 54 nuclear reactors in operation, Japan is importing coal and oil as if there is no tomorrow – and no Kyoto protocol, whose emissions targets it will now not meet. Japan's overreliance on nuclear power as a \"clean\" alternative to coal- and oil-fired stations should give the world pause for thought. Britain is now going down the same route. The debate is complex, but it must not assume the same thing couldn't happen here. That's what they said in Japan after Chernobyl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/may/15/severn-barrage-peter-hain-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T13:39:10Z","webTitle":"Should a tidal barrage be built across the Severn estuary? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/15/severn-barrage-peter-hain-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/may/15/severn-barrage-peter-hain-energy","fields":{"headline":"Should a tidal barrage be built across the Severn estuary?","bodyText":"9.24am: Peter Hain, the shadow Welsh secretary, quit front-bench politics yesterday to focus on launching a campaign to build a tidal barrage across the Severn estuary. In a statement on his website, Hain said he hoped \"to help secure Wales the biggest infrastructure project it has ever seen\": This will require a private Bill, but I hope the Government will back it...[The Barrage] will generate at least 5% of the UK's entire electricity needs, at a time when the future of nuclear power is in doubt. Nuclear power stations like Wylfa are coming to the end of their lives – that's happening right across Britain...So what is going to fill this gap? And what is going to stop the lights going off? The Severn Barrage is one of the projects, probably the key project that stops that happening. The power it can generate is equivalent to about three nuclear power stations. But, in September 2010, the coalition ruled out any public funding for the estimated £20bn project. There has been talk of smaller, privately funded barrages, but, to date, nothing concrete has emerged. The latest plan to be discussed is a barrage from Lavernock Point near Cardiff across to Brean Down near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. Last December, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was an \"interesting proposition\". However, there are environmental factors to consider beyond any low-carbon electricity that the barrage might generate. The tidal estuary is a treasured, protected habitat for birds and marine wildlife. What impact would a barrage have of the area's flora and fauna? What are your views? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict. 9.40am: Peter Hain has sent me this fuller explanation for why he is so keen to see a tidal barrage built across the Severn estuary: The Cardiff-Weston Severn barrage is the single most important low carbon, renewable energy project in Europe and should be backed by all those serious about tackling climate change. It would generate the equivalent of several nuclear power stations, and contribute over 5% of Britain's entire electricity requirements. It would harness the enormous tidal power of the Severn estuary which has the second highest tidal range in the world. Tidal energy generation has a considerable advantage over other renewable energy technologies, because tides are predictable and constant. Whereas wind and solar are intermittent, tidal power is continuous. The project backers, Corlan Hafren, have engaged with the RSPB and other environmentalists to address their concerns. Turbine design has been reconfigured to be fish-friendly and the ebb and flow mechanism to be used will enable the Severn estuary above the barrage to be maintained at a much more stable level rather than the massive rise and fall which makes it so harsh for the Severn's fragile ecosystems. Research suggests that a Barrage would also reinvigorate the environment and protect declining species such as the Dunlin, an iconic bird in the Severn which has experienced a catastrophic fall in numbers. Not only will existing ecosystems be protected, but a study of La Rance Barrage in France suggests that there would be a significant increase in faunal abundance and biodiversity. The barrage would slow down the fearsome Severn tide, introducing more light and oxygen and therefore improving the water quality, attracting more fish which will support greater and more diverse birdlife. There would also be significant economic benefits – exactly the kind of green jobs and investment environmentalists have long been demanding. At the peak of construction the barrage would create 35,000 jobs distributed over the UK with about half in South Wales. Well over 10,000 permanent jobs would be created around the estuary. There will be huge new opportunities for new leisure activities such as water sports, fishing and bird watching on both sides of the Severn estuary. Additionally, the Cardiff Weston barrage would also act as a storm surge barrier protecting people's homes and assets that are under threat from rising sea levels and increasingly volatile weather. It will produce electricity for generations to come, with a life expectancy of 150 years as a tried and tested technology. La Rance has been reliably generating tidal power for nearly forty years and has a long and profitable life ahead. Potential developers have made clear that they do not need any public money. If they have the active backing of the government, especially through the planning process, and for a private parliamentary bill, they are confident of raising the £30bn plus funding necessary to build it. In short, the barrage is a unique opportunity to produce green energy and tackle climate change; create employment; safeguard peoples' homes from rising water levels and protect and promote indigenous wildlife and biodiversity. 9.56am: Iolo ap Dafydd, BBC Wales's environment correspondent, has put together this four-minute video report which gives a good flavour of the range of views and emotions generated by the Severn barrage proposal. 10.39am: Thanks to ergolargo below the line who points to a paper published in the journal Environmental Impact Assessment Review last year. Its authors examined the \"environmental interactions of tidal and wave energy generation devices\" and came to the following conclusion: The principle environmental effects produced from the operation of a tidal barrage are the changed tidal regime and its impact on bird communities and benthic habitat availability. The impacts on bird feeding habitat can be mitigated by the provision of new intertidal areas/lagoons which provide feeding grounds during the high water period landward of the barrage, and through the use of a dual cycle generation regime or the substitution of the barrage by a tidal fence. The latter options both give a lower energy yield. If the site was on a fish migration route (salmonids, eels, shad) appropriate provision would need to be provided by means of fish passes etc. The impacts on benthic habitats are not easily mitigated; a certain degree of loss of the regional habitat pool is inevitable. 11.52am: Canada's Bay of Fundy, like the Severn estuary, has one of the world's highest tidal ranges. It too has long been the focus of those seeking to build a barrage. A small 20MW barrage across the mouth of the Annapolis River has been in place since the 1980s. There have been a couple of incidents over the years of whales getting trapped in the sluices, but environmental damage caused by silting seems to be the principle concern of a larger scale barrage across the whole bay. The Save Our Severn campaign (seemingly inactive since the government said in 2010 that it would not giving public funding to a barrage) made much of the research of Dr Graham Daborn, a researcher at the Acadia Centre for Estuarine Research in Canada, into the effects of silting. But in a 2008 study, Daborn wrote that much still has to be learned: Our experience in the Bay of Fundy system, the Miramichi (Canada), the Humber and Severn Estuaries (UK) and the work of colleagues in the Netherlands and around the world shows that the fine sediments that dominate suspensions in the water column of macrotidal estuaries do not behave in any way like non-cohesive sediments (e.g. sands) that engineers have traditionally modelled. Their settlement rate depends upon: particle size, salinity of the water, temperature, the mineralogy, the organic content, and the presence and activity of biological factors such as bacteria and phytoplankton. Once settled on the bottom, these sediments continue to display entirely unique properties... In order to understand this behaviour we need to know in detail: sediment concentrations, sediment type (mineralogy and grain size), organic content, current velocities, shear velocities, turbulence, wave height and period, diatom concentrations and growth rates, invertebrate types and densities , and important vertebrates such as fish and birds that have major effects on benthic invertebrates. None of this information seems to have been available to or acquired by the consultants that prepared the CER. Consequently, I suggest that it is impossible at this time to make any judgement beyond pure guesswork about the effect of the barrages, the channel and the filling/discharging operations that would be involved in building this project. 11.56am: I have received this response from Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director: A two-year study by Decc (pdf) concluded that the strategic case for government support of a c£30 billion barrage had not been made. The 2010 statement confirmed that the government would not return to this unless or until the strategic case changed and not within the life of this Parliament. We welcome the opportunity for constructive dialogue with both Peter Hain and with potential developers, and we welcome the up-front consideration being given to reducing or avoiding the environmental impacts of a barrage scheme. However, we do not recognise Peter Hain's interpretation of our position. The RSPB has been clear, and the Decc study confirmed, that a conventional, high-head barrage would effectively destroy the estuary, and that the scale of the effects of a lower-head barrage on the estuary, on birds, fish, and flood risk are still unclear and would need to be carefully assessed. We don't believe that a post-barrage estuary would support greater wildlife or potential for bird life than it does at present, and to date no details of the turbine design have been made available, preventing us from having a view on the likely impacts on fish. Until details of the resulting proposal are made available, it is wrong to suggest that environmental objections have been overcome. 12.03pm: And this just in from Gareth Clubb, director of Friends of the Earth Cymru: We have yet to see the specific proposals for a Severn barrage that Peter Hain is campaigning for, but we have real concerns about the potential impact of a massive concrete structure on an internationally important wildlife habitat. We agree that we need to invest in clean British energy, including tidal power, to reduce our nation's dependence on dirty and expensive fossil fuels, create jobs and tackle climate change. But there are alternative ways to capture tidal energy that could cause less damage - and could also provide clean energy sooner than the 20 years it will take to build a barrage. 12.33pm: I have been trying, so far without joy, to reach someone from the Coral Hafren consortium to get hold of more details about their proposed barrage between Lavernock Point and Brean Down. Its website is a simple holding page without contact details or further information. (Interestingly, a search at Companies House shows that one of Coral Hafren Ltd's directors in John Gummer - now Lord Deben - the former Conservative environment secretary of state.) However, this recent article in the Weston, Worle and Somerset Mercury carries some comments by Roger Falconer, the Halcrow professor of water management at Cardiff University. Halcrow is said to be part of the Coral Hafren consortium. From the article: [Falconer] said: \"The Severn Estuary barrage would last at least 125 years. My team has been working to get as much power as possible with a two-way generator, which will produce power on an out-going tide and in-coming tide, that way the flood risk is reduced.\" Dr Falconer said the barrage could reduce up to 14,000 inter-tidal habitats but could also produce clearer water. He said: \"It will not be crystal clear, but it will be a lot better. \"There will be more light penetration which will help break down the bacteria in the sediment and encourage more sealife.\" Dr Falconer added: \"We are talking about a dramatic change. The barrage will have a lasting impact and could bring in excess of 50,000 jobs for the whole area, which will mostly be in the Weston and Cardiff region. \"It will act as a catalyst for jobs for Wales and the South West and there is the possibility of road or rail links between Weston and Cardiff.\" If I receive more details from anyone connected to Coral Hafren I will post them below. 1.15pm: Here are the thoughts of Alun James, policy officer of WWF Cymru: In 2010, the government's feasibility study into Severn Tidal Power found that a Cardiff-Weston barrage that used high-head turbines would result in loss of more than half the intertidal habitat for birds, the possible local extinction of some fish species, water quality problems upstream, and increased tidal heights as far away as the east coast of Ireland. But there was the tantalising prospect that emerging technologies - such as low-head fish-friendly turbines - could reduce the worst impacts. Let's see these technologies progressed and tested before considering any new scheme. 2.04pm: A spokeswoman at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has sent me the following statement: DECC's thinking on a Severn barrage is set out in the feasibility study report we published in late 2010. It concluded that there isn't a good case for a publicly-funded energy scheme in the Severn at this point compared to the other options for delivering secure and low carbon electricity. It didn't rule out a privately financed barrage, though, and we are aware of a number of possible schemes. Corlan Hafren approached us late last year with a draft outline business case for a Severn barrage project and officials have met the consortium to discuss it and the next steps to enable us to assess whether the benefits in terms of economic growth and renewable energy justify the costs and the environmental consequences for the Severn estuary. Government is open to working with viable and environmentally responsible proposals that offer energy consumers good value for the subsidy costs they would pay as part of electricity bills. A public subsidy for a Severn Barrage would still be needed even if the capital costs were privately funded. 2.44pm: Beyond choosing whether to build a barrage or not, the key decision is selecting which type of technology to adopt. Do you use barrages or lagoons? A combination of both? Or do you instead go for a series of smaller tidal stream generators? Pulse Tidal based in Sheffield is one company currently trying to research and develop the latter. Earlier this month, it was given permission to establish a tidal energy test facility off the coast at Lynmouth, north Devon. Last December, BBC Humberside produced this video report about how some of these technologies are now being tested on the Hull estuary. In 2009, the Guardian produced this interactive graphic showing the five different projects - including barrages and lagoons - that were being considered at that time. 3.41pm: Here are the thoughts of Dr Douglas Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist and policy director: We support tidal power, including tidal range in the Severn. However, there are a variety of ways of delivering tidal range power of which a barrage is only one and it is not clear that it is the best. Looking at the range of renewable energy options available to UK the barrage seems to be a poor choice. Previous feasibility studies have shown it is expensive, damaging to globally significant habitat and not scalable - in other word, once you've done a barrage in the Severn, that's a lot of the resource used, whereas wind/solar/geothermal/tidal stream can be replicated in many places. For example, construction of a major offshore wind farm, skills, learning, infrastructure and viable company models can be used to produce further offshore wind capacity. This option is not available for the Severn Barrage. So Greenpeace currently believes a proposal for a barrage is a poor use of public funds, time and political effort compared with other options such as scaling up offshore wind, or speeding wave and tidal stream technologies to market. Some of which could be used to look at other possible options for use of the large renewable potential in the River Severn tidal range. Regarding wildlife impacts, Greenpeace recognises that we will need both large quantity and variety of renewable energy – many forms of renewable energy have some impact on wildlife so we need to look at each proposition on its own merits. We understand that a barrage would be very damaging to rare inter-tidal habitats, which again emphasises that this is not a priority for Government time or support. 5.41pm: Simon Brenman of the South West Wildlife Trusts has sent me this comment: The Wildlife Trusts recognise the huge potential that the Severn estuary has as a source of energy. However, it also provides vital habitat for a vast number of birds, supports juvenile fish species, and is the fourth largest expanse of mud and sand flats in the UK. A barrage has the potential to destroy a large proportion of the estuary's internationally recognised wildlife and habitats, which is why ehe Wildlife Trusts are opposed to the full barrage schemes. We need renewables, but not at the expense of our wildlife. They must be sited in the right place using the right technology. When the proposals were being considered in 2010, three more innovative options known as the Severn Embryonic Technologies Scheme were looked at, which would have the lowest impact on the environment. The Wildlife Trusts still think that these and similar ideas need further research to establish whether these technologies could allow the power of the Severn estuary to be harnessed. 6.15pm: My verdict As has already been said by a number of commentators and readers, we really need more details about the proposed barrage that Peter Hain is arguing for before a meaningful assessment can be made about whether it deserves our support. But I'm pleased the wider subject of using the Severn estuary to generate electricity appears to be back on the table. It seems foolish to rule out this unique source of renewable energy, especially if the burden on the taxpayer can be minimised, as the Corlan Hafren consortium seems to be promising. But, again, let's await the details. My own preference would be to see a network of tidal stream generators positioned throughout the estuary, rather than one monolithic structure straddling the six miles between Cardiff and Weston. The environmental risks associated with the later seem too severe when alternatives appear to be available. Greenpeace's Doug Parr makes a sensible point that developing tidal stream generators also means that the technology can be much more readily replicated and exported. The timescales involved with getting tidal stream generators on-stream also seem much shorter than waiting at least a decade before a large barrage starts generating electricity. But at least Peter Hain's intervention might kick-start this debate once more, which, as I've stated, is to be welcomed. 9.15am: Here's Julian Boss of the Institute for Sustainability: If the country spent £20bn on energy efficiency in our oldest and least energy efficient homes, schools, hospitals, offices, factories etc then we can begin to reduce the required size of generating capacity and can look at the energy mix more carefully. We must reduce the demand first, then flatten the demand curve to give the most sustainable target for generation. The tidal barrage has been examined again and again and each time a new minister comes along who needs to find out for themselves why a barrage is the wrong solution. Tidal stream turbines or tidal reef design (as recommended by RSPB in 2008) can capture tidal energy with far less impact on the extensive ecosystems which are centred on the Severn Estuary. Without an electricity storage solution any tidal barrage will currently generate power for about half the time that the UK demand will require it due to the tidal times and range being inconveniently non-aligned to the UK publics energy use habits. Update: Julian Boss has asked me to point out this is a personal view and does not represent the official view of the Institute for Sustainability. 2.34pm: Dr Philippe Blondel, who is based at the University of Bath and whose \"research focuses on the physical understanding of acoustic remote sensing and its uses in underwater environments\", has sent me this comment: The renewed interest in the Severn barrage shows the increasing importance of renewable energy, especially in the marine environment. It also shows how crucial it is to assess the environmental impact before anything is built, during operation, and even after decommissioning. Environmental Impact Assessments are now required for all offshore projects, and can use a variety of tools, from surveys of marine life to maps of the seabed and habitats underwater (with sonars) and above water (including on land). Our team at the University of Bath designs and operates acoustic systems to monitor marine habitats. We have done this around Europe, in the Arctic, and we are currently gearing up for long-duration surveys of a marine renewable energy site (FLOWBEC project). With funding from NERC/DEFRA, the FLOWBEC project aims to improve the understanding of how the physical behaviour of the water such as currents, waves and turbulence at renewable sites influences the behaviour of marine wildlife, and how tide and wave energy devices might alter the behaviour of such wildlife. We shall be deploying our adapted sonar device at a site off the coast of Orkney at the end of June for two deployments of two weeks each. We are also preparing deployments at other test sites around the UK. We will be sharing the knowledge gained with other users and providing our data as an open resource for environmental scientists. Until we can look at all the data, on more than one site and more than one technology, I think the jury is still out as to the impacts and benefits of these technologies on wildlife and the environment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/feb/03/chris-huhne-greens-done-well","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-03T10:35:30Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne: most greens 'think he has done well'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/03/chris-huhne-greens-done-well","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/feb/03/chris-huhne-greens-done-well","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne: most greens 'think he has done well'","bodyText":"Soaring energy bills, falling investment in green energy, rising fuel poverty, the impact of the Fukushima nuclear accident, fractious climate change negotiations, veiled attacks from the chancellor – even without the tumult in his personal life, Chris Huhne has faced a turbulent scene since taking over as energy and climate change secretary, one of the most senior cabinet roles taken by the junior partners in the coalition. But Huhne won plaudits from many in the green movement who saw him fight for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) against sceptics in the Treasury and secure vital funds for key projects despite dismal government finances. \"Most greens think he has done well,\" said Lady Worthington, a labour peer and environmental campaigner. \"He has held his own in the battles against the Treasury, secured funding for renewable heat and the green investment bank, and he has been very approachable, which is a good thing in a cabinet minister.\" Andrew Raingold, of the Aldersgate Group of businesses with an interest in greening the economy, said: \"His biggest success has been winning the argument with cabinet colleagues on the fourth carbon budget [which strengthened the UK's carbon-cutting targets up to 2027], demonstrating that ambitious carbon cuts through the 2020s can benefit both the environment and the economy. He has also managed to get major concessions from the Treasury regarding the green investment bank, ensuring that it will have £3bn in initial funding in spite of severe fiscal constraints.\" Huhne has also won plaudits for his performances abroad, both in Europe, where he has attempted to build a coalition of member states to push for tougher EU-wide carbon targets, and in the long-running international climate change negotiations where he helped to broker a surprise global deal at the end of last year's talks in Durban. Margaret Ounsley, head of public affairs at WWF-UK, said: \"Chris Huhne understands the very complex issue of climate change, and his negotiating skills were key in helping to get the climate change talks back on track.\" Some of the problems Huhne has faced were not of his making – energy bills rose largely on the back of international gas prices, the Fukushima accident sent the global nuclear industry into a spin, and outright hostility to green policies from the rightwing media was stoked by the chancellor's public statements scorning green taxes. But there have also been several own goals: Decc pursued a damaging policy U-turn over renewable energy through the courts, to be defeated when its slashing of feed-in tariffs for solar power was ruled unlawful, and the \"green deal\" policy to encourage the take-up of insulation and other low-carbon technologies has been derided by many experts as too weak. Andrew Simms, fellow at the New Economics Foundation, said: \"A major failure was allowing George Osborne to set such a medieval tone for environmental policy, possibly the most regressive proclamation by such a senior figure for decades. The green deal is pitifully small, and Huhne must take some responsibility for the feed-in tariffs fiasco.\" Clare McNeil, senior research fellow at IPPR, added: \"Energy market reform was a big missed opportunity, as he could have taken a much firmer stance on the issue of competition [among the big six energy suppliers].\" Craig Bennett, director of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \"Leaving consumers to compare energy tariffs as a way to tackle soaring bills is woefully inadequate. What we really need is decisive action from government to get us off the hook of expensive fossil fuels and invest in clean British energy instead.\" It was not just solar power businesses, complaining of thousands of jobs lost and millions of pounds of investment forgone when the feed-in tariffs were slashed last year, who criticised Decc under Huhne's leadership. His push for a toughening of the EU emissions-cutting target, from 20% to 30% by 2020, drew the ire of some, and the government angered many companies when it reformed a key policy, the carbon reduction commitment, so that the money raised from it flowed to the Treasury rather than returning to businesses. Praise from some sections of business was lukewarm. Neil Bentley, deputy director general of the CBI employers' organisation, said: \"Chris Huhne has led some significant long-term policies to help shift the UK to a low-carbon economy, such as the green deal and reform of the electricity markets. But other short-term decisions, like those on the carbon reduction commitment and solar feed-in tariffs, have caused greater uncertainty among businesses and investors.\" David Porter of the Association of Electricity Producers added: \"At first I was concerned about his past position on nuclear power [which the Lib Dems opposed before the coalition], but in office he seemed to cope with that and help bring [nuclear power] forward.\" But Gareth Stacey, of manufacturers' organisation EEF, said Decc under Huhne was \"very interested in working together with industries and manufacturers in partnership to achieve its aims\", which he said was positive. He said: \"What we'd like to see is Decc taking a more strategic approach to further developing the policies within its portfolio rather than use a sticking-plaster approach.\" Huhne's successor cannot expect a much easier ride. Probably the biggest difficulty Ed Davey will face is the increasingly vociferous campaigning from sections of the media and free-market thinktanks against policies to encourage green growth, such as renewable energy subsidies and levies on carbon. Claims that green taxes could add thousands of pounds to energy bills by 2020 were refuted by the government, which argues that its analysis shows rising oil and gas prices will mean consumers see a net gain. But Simon Less, head of environment and energy at the thinktank Policy Exchange, laid out his challenge for the new minister. \"Huhne oversaw the dismantling of the competitive electricity market – a UK policy success emulated across the world – through the ill-thought-through electricity market reform and failed to challenge Labour's hugely and unnecessarily expensive approach to reducing carbon emissions through an excessive focus on deploying very high cost renewable technologies (offshore wind), squandering resources which could be much better spent delivering lower cost short-term carbon reduction and doing more to stimulate low-carbon innovation for the longer term,\" he said. \"The next secretary of state for energy comes in time to alter course to reshape energy policy [by] reining back unnecessary costs while delivering more to mitigate climate change, and stopping the slide back to a risky and costly world of central planning the electricity system.\" • This article was amended on Saturday 4 February 2012.

The 164ft (50 metre) ghost ship survived an initial barrage of 25mm shells that left it ablaze but still afloat. After dousing the flames, coastguard vessels opened fire again with more powerful explosives, which sent it more than 1,000ft to the bottom of the sea about 180 miles off the coast of Alaska. The four-hour operation to sink the ship had been already delayed for several hours after a Canadian fishing boat made an unsuccessful attempt to recover the Ryo-Un-Maru for salvage. Its fate had been sealed after local officials decided to sink it rather than allow it to run aground or continue to float in busy shipping lanes between North America and Asia. The ship had no lights or communications system, and its tank was able to carry more than 2,000 gallons (9,100 litres) of diesel fuel. Officials, however, did not know how much fuel, if any, was aboard. \"It's less risky than it would be running into shore or running into [maritime] traffic,\" coastguard spokesman Paul Webb said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency studied the problem and decided it was safer to sink the ship and let the fuel evaporate in the open water. The boat's Japanese owner recently appeared on Japanese TV – although his identity was not revealed – to disown the boat, fearing that the retrieval and salvage operation could add to post-disaster costs already faced by him and tens of thousands of fishermen whose businesses were destroyed by the tsunami. The vessel, registered in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, had been earmarked for the scrap heap before the disaster. Officials on the other side of the Pacific will not be able to dispose of other tsunami debris quite so easily, however. The disaster, which killed almost 20,000 people and laid waste to a long stretch of Japan's north-east coast, generated tens of millions of tonnes of wreckage. Coastal communities on the US west coast are now discussing what to do with the large quantities of flotsam that could make it ashore in the coming months. Some has already arrived – half a dozen large buoys and frames once used by Japanese oyster fishermen. There are fears – so far unfounded – that the debris may be contaminated as a result of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Alaska, state health and environmental officials have said there's little likelihood that debris landing on local shores will be contaminated by radiation. An estimated 5 million tonnes of debris were swept out to sea by the tsunami, about 70% of which sank to the sea floor, according to estimates by Nasa and the Japanese government . Most of the debris expected to hit US coastlines is predicted to arrive in 2013 or later but some items such as buoys have already washed ashore in Alaska. But the most urgent waste-management problem lies closer to home. More than a year after the disaster, less than 10% of the 24 million tonnes of debris left along Japan's coastline has been removed for burial or incineration. Most of it still sits in neat piles, surrounded by large swaths of flat land where entire towns and villages once stood. The government plans to store irradiated debris from Fukushima prefecture locally, but other localities in Japan have refused to take in wreckage from the two other worst-hit prefectures – Miyagi and Iwate – partly due to fears that it may be contaminated with radioactive caesium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/06/israel-clegg-tonge-libdem-whip","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-06T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Israel, Clegg and Tonge's loss of the Lib Dem whip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/06/israel-clegg-tonge-libdem-whip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/06/israel-clegg-tonge-libdem-whip","fields":{"headline":"Israel, Clegg and Tonge's loss of the Lib Dem whip","bodyText":"Jenny Tonge has been forced to resign the Liberal Democrat whip in the Lords for making the essentially non-controversial prediction that Israel cannot be guaranteed survival in its present form if it continues to alienate all its neighbours, including former allies such as Egypt and Turkey, all the Arabs it controls, and eventually even the taxpayers of the United States (Report, 1 March). Israel already has changed form since its creation by expanding into other people's land in violation of international law and UN security council resolutions. Its survival was put seriously at risk in October 1973 and, with the advent of a powerful Hezbollah neighbour and possibly a nuclear power in Iran, is at risk again. Even in the US, criticism of Israel is at last being publicly made by politicians, academics, writers and journalists. Why is it wrong for a British politician to point these matters out? Is Britain guaranteed survival in its \"present form\"? Is Scotland? Would a Liberal MP or peer be sacked for debating the case? What is more sinister than the reactions of Israel's representatives and placemen to Jenny Tonge is that, in this third intervention against her over her candid remarks in recent years, the leaders of the Lib Dems, encouraged by senior figures in the two other main political parties, have disempowered a British parliamentarian under pressure from the backers of a foreign state – Israel. Tim Llewellyn London • Jenny Tonge's main offence was being a member of a party for whom principle is a dirty word. Tonge stated: \"Israel will not continue much longer in its present form.\" Is Nick Clegg really saying that Israel should continue to treat its Arab citizens as guests? Or that depriving the Palestinians of the occupied territories of any democratic rights should continue, since it is clear that the West Bank is not going to be relinquished? Perhaps Clegg should consult the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz of 29 November 2007, where he will find the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stating: \"If the day comes when the two‑state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights, then, as soon as that happens, the state of Israel is finished.\" Clegg should be eating humble pie and apologising profusely for having jumped when the tabloids barked. Tony Greenstein Brighton • I am appalled at the way Jenny Tonge has been treated. I spoke at the same Middlesex University debate as her on 23 February. Her remarks about Israel were clearly made in the context of its continuing repression of the Palestinians and its violations of international norms of behaviour – hardly startling news. No one could have objected, except the hysterical supporters of Israel who came to attack her, and the Lib Dem leaders too craven to stand up to them. Ghada Karmi London • I was deeply saddened to read of Nick Clegg forcing Baroness Tonge's resignation merely for stating the obvious. The true friends of Israel long ago realised that US taxpayers cannot subsidise them forever, and their only hope for peace is in a genuine partnership of equals with their Palestinian neighbours.

Exactly a week after Tutu attacked him in the Observer he popped up in this week's Sunday papers helping to rescue the troubled $80bn mining mega-merger between Glencore and Xstrata. What's going on? Well, for one thing Blair is going on. His hair seems to be getting blonder but that could happen to anyone who spends much of the summer on the tennis court. According to reports, if the Glencore/Xstrata merger/takeover is completed – it's still in doubt – he may pick up $1m (£620,000) for work on the phone and a crucial session at Claridge's hotel. A handy addition to his fine collection of banknotes, it's all of a piece with the role the former prime minister has created for himself after being driven from office by Gordon Brown's cohorts in 2007, part businessman, part philanthropist – all those foundations for sport, faith and Africa – part roving statesman in the Middle East and elsewhere. He's made millions but, as I've written before, his friends sometimes warn him that he's spread himself too thinly and that he'll never make enough to be accepted on equal terms with the really rich. \"Do less better,\" they say, as some said in his heyday at No 10. I suspect it's not in his restless nature to be still or reflective for long. But all this goes on side-by-side with his parallel image as a fugitive from international justice, at least in the eyes of his detractors on both left and right, a very unholy and hardline alliance between a familiar chorus of America-bashers and the Blair-baiting Daily Mail tribe – John Pilger and Simon Heffer, Noam Chomsky and Stephen Glover, George Monbiot and Max Hastings. Here's a recent sample from MediaLens. Some of these people hate each other as much as they hate Blair (or the Tory ones hate David Cameron, for that matter), they're good haters and he's always in the Rolodex when there's a temporary shortage of targets and 1,000 words to write. Tutu's declared refusal to attend a conference where the man of blood was present was a cue for renewed attacks and speculations, including an imaginary – and rather improbable – account of Blair's future Old Bailey trial. The 2,000-word hatchet job was written for the Mail by a thriller writer called Tom Cain who turns out to be a recycled version of the fiftysomething Fleet Street journalist David Thomas. Hang on to the day job, David. Aggression No less a figure than the Guardian's own George Monbiot took time off from his day job guarding planet Earth from its despoilers to persuade loyal readers that Tutu's pronouncement had helped \"de-normalise\" Blair and made more likely an eventual appearance in some foreign court charged with crimes of aggression in breach of international law. Here's an earlier version. No, I don't ever expect this to happen, nor do I think it should. But I usually find the formidable Monbiot's arguments stimulating even when I disagree with them. Like William Rees-Mogg of the Times, a rather older curmudgeon, he illuminates the landscape in interesting and sometimes unpredictable ways – and can also admit to changing his mind, say on nuclear power or peak oil, which is a good virtue. Not everyone can do it. This year Monbiot has even resumed combat with his former hero Noam Chomsky over the familiar controversy surrounding the shameful 1995 Srebrenica massacre, a dangerous thing to do considering the militant cult that guards the old man. In this instance I fear GM is re-ploughing muddy ground on the Iraq war and that most of his key points are open to dispute in a pretty fundamental way – arguments with which most people are familiar. To take up one of them, after much shilly-shallying the then attorney general, Peter Goldsmith, assured the fateful cabinet on 17 March 2003 that military action against Saddam Hussein would be legal. I read that – again – in Peter Hain's new memoirs (Outside In, Biteback £12.99) last week: I know what you're thinking, but Hain was present and uncomfortable. He has never been a pushover either – not since his high-profile, high-risk sports boycotting teens. Others present in cabinet have said the same. It's also not true that ministers knew Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction and lied about it. Whitehall and Washington persuaded themselves that he did – as Saddam wished them (and his own people) to believe. And so on. Did UNSCR 1441 authorise the use of force? Its crucial ambiguity will remain just that. There's little point in rehashing all this much-disputed territory, though I have been pleased to note lately that adamant assertions of a one-million-plus death toll in Iraq are becoming more tentative and now acknowledge the lower 100,000 estimates of the carnage. In due course it may be possible to acknowledge who did most of the killing in the quasi-civil war unleashed by Saddam's overthrow and the incompetent occupation strategy. Not Americans, I think. Bounty George Monbiot's passion to nail Blair has resulted in the very interesting ArrestBlair website and the offer of bounty money, for which a Hong Kong activist was paid £2,420 for a failed attempt to collar the ex-PM in June. The theory is that there are at least 25 states – and rising – which now incorporate the crime of aggression into their domestic law. Hope springs eternal. I suppose that this sort of campaign is admirable if you feel very strongly about something, but for those of us who don't it's puzzlingly selective. Why Iraq, a complex situation then as now, with few untainted good guys? Why not so many other grisly failures of statecraft, some of which cannot be laid at Blair's or George Bush's door? And why are some people so much keener than others to shoehorn events into their own preconceived value system – west always good/west always bad etc – when real life is usually much messier? Some veteran anti-apartheid campaigners were even puzzled by the redoubtable archbishop's attack on Blair at a time when targets closer to home – the Marikana mine massacre – looked more urgent. Perhaps they told him because he later weighed in on behalf of the striking miners and attacked his old ANC comrades, now in government. Good for him. But Blair remains an unusual example of a public figure with a very bifurcated status – both reviled and respected as only Margaret Thatcher has been on this scale in Britain's postwar politics and, in her case, the loathing is partisan, mostly from the left. Despite being Labour's great election winner – or is it because of it – Blair gets it in the neck from both sides but continues to lead his tanned and successful parallel life while his enemies fume. Puzzling. Yet it is far too soon to assess his place, if any, in the history of our times, both domestic and foreign. Why, only the other day I heard a well connected Arab suggest that yes, the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 had indeed been a trigger for the wave of democratic self-assertion now sweeping the Arab world with incalculable consequences. We'll see – and so will he.

Yet prime minister David Cameron has at the last minute downgraded a planned \"keynote speech\" on the environment, trailed as a \"major policy intervention\", to just five minutes of introductory \"remarks\" (see Thursday morning). It is an extraordinary betrayal and abject failure of leadership. Cameron pledged to lead the \"greenest government ever\" and was elected with photogenic huskies and a \"vote blue, go green slogan\". But after two years in No 10, he has given no speech dedicated to the issue at the heart of his Tory decontamination strategy. The speech on Thursday, at a clean energy ministerial (CEM) in London and attended by energy ministers from the world's 23 biggest economies, was set to break that silence, as I reported on 4 April. In a government document I have obtained, the event is described as \"PM keynote speech to CEM participants\". Cameron's contribution will now be five minutes of introductory remarks to a roundtable, followed by a Q&amp;A with the ministers. Those remarks are being used as green fig leaf by the prime minister's office, who say the form of Cameron's contribution was never finalised. Not in public perhaps but everyone, including ministers at the department of energy and climate change and green campaigners who had been canvassed for ideas, were in no doubt whatsoever that a keynote speech was in the diary. \"It will be a major policy intervention by the prime minister,\" climate change minister and Tory moderniser Greg Barker told me on 4 April. He described the speech as a major keynote on the green economy. \"All the big players in the energy sector will be there: China, US, Germany, France, Brazil, Abu Dhabi and so on.\" Why does Cameron's U-turn matter? Because a section of the Conservative party, led by chancellor George Osborne have been openly hostile to green initiatives, talking of \"putting our country out of business\" and burdening businesses \"with endless social and environmental goals\". The reality is the polar opposite. The green economy already contributes 7% of GDP and employs 900,000 people in the UK, more than teaching. Moreover, it is that rarity in these austere times: a growing sector in which the UK has a competitive advantage. The coalition has brought forward a series of good policies, from the green investment bank to the green deal, yet the investors who will fund the nation's transition to a clean, sustainable green economy desperately need wholehearted backing from the top of government. The festering uncertainty its absence leaves infects confidence, leading to cancelled jobs and piling billions in costs onto energy bill payers, who have to stump up the extra cost of political uncertainty. With the dream of new nuclear power plants in the UK crumbling in the face of high costs, a deafening committment to energy efficiency and renewable energy is essential. What we get is a cancelled speech and a craven capitulation to the Daily Mail over the \"conservatory tax\" that never was. Why can't Cameron step up to the plate? There are plenty of theories, all inexcusable. Perhaps he didn't want to be talking about windmills on the day growth figures may show the UK economy back in recession. The green economy is the solution to that, not the problem. Perhaps he is worried about the elections across the nation on 3 May. If so, he's read the opinion polls: people want renewable energy. Jim Pickard at the FT reports that: \"Cameron decided it was more useful to do a roundtable with executives and politicians – and issue a press release on the side – rather than a grandstanding speech.\" That insults our intelligence, but it gets worse. \"This wouldn't require the work of five speechwriters, was how one aide put it,\" writes Pickard. If that was a real issue - which it isn't - Cameron could have used the speech I wrote for him for free. The truth is likely to be simpler. For a significant number of Conservative supporters - though a small minority of the nation overall - talking green is a vote loser. If there was any lingering doubt about the lack of genuine committment to the environment at the top of the Conservative party and this government, none now remains. The prime minister has not spoken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-12T23:10:02Z","webTitle":"Manchester Report: Thorium nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Thorium nuclear power","bodyText":"The uranium that makes conventional nuclear power possible has a number of significant disadvantages. For one thing, uranium reactors generate large quantities of waste. Much of this remains dangerous for thousands of years, and a proportion of it can be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. A second issue is that uranium is a comparatively scarce material, which exists in significant quantities in only a small number of countries. The theoretical risk of giant explosions caused by uranium reactors is a further concern. For all of these reasons, a growing number of scientists and energy experts believe that the world should switch from uranium to thorium as its primary nuclear fuel. Compared to uranium, thorium is far more abundant as well as much more energy-dense. In addition, the waste products generated by thorium are virtually impossible to turn into plutonium – and they remain dangerous for hundred of years rather than thousands. There are a number of different ways to use thorium to produce electricity. In Manchester, Kirk Sorensen made the case for liquid-fluoride reactors. This technology was developed by the US military in the 1950s and 1960s and was shown to have many benefits. For example, reactors of this type can be smaller than conventional uranium reactors, partly thanks to their low-pressure operation. Despite its early promise, research into liquid-fluoride thorium reactors was abandoned – the most likely reason being that the technology offered no potential for producing nuclear weapons. Sorensen estimates that between 5,000-6,000 tonnes of thorium could produce as much energy as the world currently consumes each year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/19/nuclear-power-gas-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-18T23:09:30Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: The consumer always pays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/19/nuclear-power-gas-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/19/nuclear-power-gas-coal","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: The consumer always pays","bodyText":"From the outside, there is nothing unusual about the warehouse by the offices on Finland's Olkiluoto island, site of what should have been the world's first modern nuclear reactor. But inside, stacked on five kilometres of shelving, are 160,000 documents. \"If a valve for the reactor is changed, it comes in a small box and a van full of documents,\" complains Jouni Silvennoinen, project director for Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), the Finnish utility that ordered the plant from the Franco-German consortium Areva-Siemens. The paper mountain helps explain why the reactor, which should have cost €3bn (£2.72bn) and been working this year, will now miss its revised completion date of mid-2012 and will cost at least €5.3bn. In the latest delay, Finland's nuclear safety regulator halted welding on the reactor last week and criticised poor oversight by the sub-contractor, supplier and TVO. Areva claims TVO does not trust it to modify the fiendishly complex design as it sees fit, demanding documentation and approval from regulators for every change, however small. TVO says Areva is treating the new reactor as an R&amp;D project in which the Finns are guinea pigs. TVO and Areva are now locked in arbitration over the cost overrun and damages. If TVO loses, Finnish consumers will pick up the tab. Worryingly for the UK, Areva intends to build at least four of these reactors in Britain. The government wants to replace those being decommissioned as well as provide a secure and low-carbon supply of electricity. The project was supposed to be a model for how modern reactors would be built. The industry's history of massive cost overruns, government bailouts and subsidies have provided ammunition to campaigners who claim the economics of nuclear power do not add up. The construction of the new generation of reactors would be different: this time, nuclear power would pay for itself. Yet already cracks are appearing in these claims, especially in the UK. Nuclear plants are far more expensive to build than coal or gas but have lower fuel costs. The economics of all three vary according to the prices of the fuel and increasingly, of carbon. When coal prices are high, gas plants become more cost effective, and vice versa. When both fuels are costly – which also drives up the wholesale price of electricity – nuclear can undercut coal and gas. Gambling on unpredictable energy markets is risky. To make the huge upfront investment needed for a nuclear plant – upwards of €4bn compared with just €600m to build a slightly smaller gas plant – the stakes go higher still. The UK energy market is particularly unsuited to nuclear investors. Unlike less liberalised markets such as Finland's, UK energy producers are more reluctant to sign long-term supply contracts to support investment in a new reactor. And because of full competition in the UK energy market, if EDF Energy makes a loss on building reactors, it is much harder to pass its costs on to its consumers, unlike its parent company in France, which dominates supply there. Since the government began reconsidering its position on nuclear four years ago, the economics have become more unfavourable. The cost of building a reactor has soared, partly as a result of the Finland debacle but also because of higher steel and other construction costs. According to Simon Harrison, energy director at Mott MacDonald, the price of new reactors being quoted to utilities at the end of 2008 had increased almost three-fold from 2005, although costs are expected to fall as a utility orders more reactors. In the past couple of years, coal and gas prices have fallen by more than half, dragging wholesale electricity prices down with them, and leaving nuclear, with its fixed higher costs, unable to compete. Crucially, the price gas and coal operators pay to emit carbon pollution is also far too low to give nuclear an advantage. Given the ease with which governments have manipulated the EU's emissions trading scheme, which sets the carbon price, companies are not confident that future prices will be significantly higher. As a result, the industry is rethinking its plans on nuclear. The Guardian has learned that, following lobbying by the nuclear industry – and from EDF Energy in particular – the government is preparing to intervene and prop up the carbon price. This will raise the cost of operating coal and gas plants – and of electricity – relative to nuclear. The Conservative party has similar plans. In reality, there is little alternative for the government but to intervene. Energy companies have no obligation to build reactors locally, and will invest elsewhere if they think they will make a better return. As coal and nuclear plants close, a generation gap is looming. Since the government banned the construction of new coal plants that do not bury their carbon emissions, the only realistic alternative to building more reactors is more gas plants, which depend on imports from unreliable places such as Russia. As one adviser to EDF Energy put it: \"The sword of Damocles will be hanging over whoever is in power – the political fallout of the lights going out would be huge. If I was EDF, I would be thinking quite carefully about its bargaining power on nuclear.\" Political parties and companies such as EDF Energy deny that a carbon tax would be a subsidy for the nuclear industry. They point out that it would also benefit other low-carbon forms of power. But wind farms already receive hefty subsidies and clean coal technology is not yet proven. Whatever the politicians say in public, it is widely believed that the nuclear industry is intended to be the principal beneficiary, initially at least. Malcolm Wicks, former energy minister and now the prime minister's special representative for energy, insists that consumers, not taxpayers, will bear any additional cost of fixing the carbon price. In reality, there is no difference. Besides, nuclear provides a low carbon and secure supply of electricity crucial to meeting the government's climate change commitments and these need to be paid for, he told the Guardian. \"Economics are very important but for any energy source they cannot wholly determine your strategy.\" It is disingenuous of the government and the industry to claim that this time there will be no subsidy for nuclear. Both seem so intent to break with the past that they have forgotten that the imperative to curb carbon emissions means every form of generation is now subject to financial subsidies or penalties. If the economics of nuclear don't work, it is clear that politicians – as they have done in the past – will make sure they do. As an executive of one large energy company in the UK told the Guardian: \"There has always been intervention by governments in nuclear. 'Subsidy' has become an all-encompassing word. When you drill down into it, you realise it's meaningless. When you have a policy of carbon abatement, the consumer will always pay in the end.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/12/japan-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-12T16:30:00Z","webTitle":"Is Japan really winding back on nuclear? | Martin Dusinberre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/japan-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/japan-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Is Japan really winding back on nuclear?","bodyText":"A Japanese colleague once compared politics in his country with the movement of a swan: serene so far as one can see but with furious paddling beneath the surface of the water. Following the recent announcement from Naoto Kan, the prime minister, that Japan would \"start from scratch\" with regard to future nuclear power expansion, we can be sure that there is plenty of paddling in Tokyo. This will be especially true within the network of electricity companies and government officials that make up Japan's \"nuclear village\". The foreign media have interpreted Kan's statement as the government abandoning the construction of new nuclear power plants. But Japanese newspapers did not report it as such, and Kan's exact words – \"we need to go back to the drawing board and have a debate\" – are characteristically vague. After all, one can go back to the drawing board and draw roughly the same picture. My scepticism regarding Kan's statement comes from knowing a very different nuclear village. Kaminoseki, population 3,700, is located 50 miles south-west of Hiroshima and is the site of Japan's newest proposed nuclear power plant. If the prime minister were to visit the municipality, he would see a number of advertising boards, all drawing a similar picture. \"Together with nuclear power, a lively town,\" announces one, on the main road. Beneath the slogan, and against the backdrop of two large reactors, a mother, father and young boy are depicted enjoying a spring day's picnic – a nuclear family, as it were. The image suggests that rethinking nuclear policy in Japan will be far from straightforward. For a start, Kaminoseki leaders actively invited the construction of a nuclear power station back in the early 1980s, an example not of \"nimby\" but of \"definitely in my back yard\". That decision triggered a vociferous protest movement in one district of the town, delaying construction by almost 30 years. In the meantime, however, the local electricity company and the pro-nuclear lobby sold townspeople a vision of a \"bright\" and \"lively\" future. In particular, they presented the nuclear power station plan as the only way to save the town from the twin horrors of depopulation and ageing that blight much of rural Japan. Hard cash has backed up that vision, as part of the central government's apparatus of incentives offered to potential host communities. Despite the fact that 50% of the town's population is aged 65 or over, Kaminoseki boasts a state-of-the-art elementary school and a new hot-spring resort is under construction. Appealing to the type of young family depicted in the roadside sign, the town subsidises nappies to the tune of ¥5,000 (£37) a month. All these investments grow out of the promise of a new nuclear power plant, construction of which finally started in February 2011 but was suspended after the earthquake and tsunami. When I last visited Kaminoseki three weeks ago, one man told me that although nuclear power was frightening, the prospect of not building the Kaminoseki plant was even more frightening. Similarly, a pro-nuclear town councillor wrote of the \"crisis-like situation\" not in Fukushima, as one might expect, but in Kaminoseki. \"We must bring the nuclear plant to fruition as soon as possible,\" he added. According to this logic, to abandon new nuclear power construction would be to abandon the Kaminoseki townspeople. More significantly, it would be to write off billions of yen of investment and advance compensation paid out by central government and electricity company alike. Given the strength of pro-nuclear feeling among Kaminoseki bureaucrats, even in the wake of Fukushima, I would be surprised if Kan's drawing board changes went that far. In a country where nuclear politics has long lacked transparency at both national and local levels, the prime minister's ambiguous comments will further muddy the waters of an already complex debate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/dec/14/cable-axed-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-14T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Cable axed Sheffield Forgemasters loan because it was 'easy' target, MPs say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/14/cable-axed-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/dec/14/cable-axed-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","fields":{"headline":"Cable axed Sheffield Forgemasters loan because it was 'easy' target, MPs say","bodyText":"The coalition government was today urged to think again about securing financial support for Sheffield Forgemasters after a committee of backbench MPs said the decision to scrap an £80m loan meant an opportunity to take a lead in the civil nuclear power industry could be lost. In a report critical of the way Vince Cable, the business secretary, decided to axe the financial support agreed by his predecessor Lord Mandelson in the dying days of Gordon Brown's administration, the business innovation and skills committee said Sheffield Forgemasters had been identified as an \"easy\" target. The MPs said they recognised the need for Cable to save money as part of the £6bn cut in public spending demanded by the chancellor, George Osborne, for the current financial year and that the spotlight inevitably fell on those projects to which the government was not contractually committed. These included the loan to Sheffield Forgemasters to develop a 15,000-tonne press to make large components for the civil nuclear industry. \"A choice could therefore have been made by ministers on where the axe would fall,\" today's report said. \"We do not believe that any substantial cost-benefit analysis was undertaken on those non-contractually committed projects under review. \"Rather it appears to be the case that the Sheffield Forgemasters loan was identified as an easy cost saving. While this is a legitimate way to proceed, the department should have been more transparent in articulating this process and not hidden behind the simple defence of affordability. Furthermore, we did not receive any detailed explanation of how the Sheffield Forgemasters project was chosen ahead of the other non-contractually committed projects sponsored by the department.\" The report added: \"The establishment of such a large press would have enabled the UK to take a significant lead in this important industry. For that reason we urge the government to continue in its efforts to secure funding for this project – whether by public or private funds – so that an opportunity take a lead in this important industry is not lost. \"Therefore, we welcome the undertaking given to us by the secretary of state [Cable] that he would 'entertain' a fresh loan application from Sheffield Forgemasters.

In 1988 a scientist from the Natural History Museum saw a short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, sitting on a pile of shingle. The species was already rare but he had no reason to think it was a historic encounter. In fact, the bee was never seen again and was declared extinct in the UK 12 years ago. That status should now be changing. On Monday Gammans will take a small plastic box from the fridge in her camper van, and a group of slightly puzzled Swedish short-haired queens will tumble out into the Kent sunshine. The hope is that they make a beeline for the red clover, white dead nettle, yellow flag, tufted vetches and eggs-and-bacon, all bursting into bloom after a week of May sunshine. \"We hope, we believe, this is the absolutely perfect spot for them,\" Gammans said. \"It has everything they like. There is no reason why they shouldn't thrive – they're pretty tough girls. \"This is a flagship project, a scientific first, but also a symbol that it isn't all hopeless: we don't have to stand by helplessly watching species and habitat being lost.\" The short-haired bumblebee, which like other bees has a crucial role in pollinating plants, was once common in the UK, as far north as Humberside. It declined catastrophically, with many other species as, over the past 60 years, an estimated 97% of wild flower meadows vanished from the UK. The decline has been mirrored in many parts of Europe. But in Sweden the population is actually increasing. After a recce last year to Skåne, south Sweden, Gammans acquired the necessary permits. She enlisted her father, a retired structural engineer, to travel ahead and phone the moment he saw bumblebees emerging from hibernation in Sweden. With volunteers, she caught 100 queens there, cooled them to drowsiness in the camper van fridge, then took the ferry home to start a quarantine period at the University of London's Royal Holloway campus , and check for any sign of insect disease. Watching the immigrants forage for themselves will be a great relief to one volunteer. Alan Kenworthy, a retired IT consultant, spent the last fortnight up to his knees in a nettle patch, gathering pollen to feed the captives. Most of the nettles were non-stinging – but many did cause him pain. His task involved capturing a bumblebee, imprisoning it in a small plastic tub and letting it bash the pollen off its hind legs on to a little sponge. A morning's work collected barely enough pollen to cover the bottom of a pot, and the captured bees have been extremely cross about their contribution to science. More bumblebees will be released at other spots across the miles of rough pasture, water and shingle of the RSPB reserve at Dungeness, and in future years Gammans will be releasing many more on to the land of neighbouring farmers. With Natural England, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, and the charity Hymettus, which is dedicated to conserving bees, ants and wasps, Gammans has been working with farmers on Romney Marsh to build up habitats for plants, insects and birds, with broad strips of wild flowers along field edges or in awkward spots beyond the reach of modern farm machinery. Other farmers are being paid to manage grass for hay crops instead of cutting early and often for silage. In many places, wild flowers have returned to the land spontaneously; in other places, seed was sown, or grass cut when the flowers were setting seed and spread out the same day on less fertile soil. The results have been remarkable: not just plants and insects, but birds and mammals, including hares, have increased their numbers. \"My farmers are brilliant,\" Gammans said. \"In some cases they haven't formally joined agri-stewardship schemes, but they're just doing it. It's a return to a more traditional way, the way they remember farming was when they were children, and they've really gone for it.\" Gammans and her team of volunteers will be monitoring the sites all summer, hoping to find that the bumblebees, which mated last summer in Sweden, are thriving and breeding. Recognising them, she insists, is easy: with one broad and one narrow yellow stripe, the bumblebees look as if their mothers ran out of knitting wool. \"And they do have very short hair, bless them – their poor little abdomens look quite bald.\" • This article was amended on 28 May 2012 to correct one reference to the short-tailed bumblebee to its correct common name, the short-haired bumblebee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/oct/09/chris-huhne-fukushima-report-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-08T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"Huhne will use Fukushima report to revive nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/chris-huhne-fukushima-report-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/oct/09/chris-huhne-fukushima-report-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"Huhne will use Fukushima report to revive nuclear programme","bodyText":"The government is expected this week to try to use a post-Fukushima green light from Britain's chief nuclear safety inspector to inject momentum into its stuttering nuclear power and anti-climate-change programmes. The move will run into a hail of criticism from environmentalists who believe the latest inquiry into the nuclear industry has been rushed through and fear that ministers are backing off from their commitments to green issues. On Tuesday, Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, is scheduled to release the final report by Mike Weightman, chief inspector for nuclear installations, into what lessons should be learned from the Fukushima reactor disaster in Japan. The report is understood to contain only small amendments to an earlier, interim, report which made only minor recommendations. An upbeat message from Huhne will be aimed at countering a series of setbacks in the energy sector as deteriorating financial conditions encourage companies to pull back from nuclear and threaten to abandon carbon capture and storage (CCS) programmes. He will also want to convince critics that his Tory coalition partners are not trying to undermine the low-carbon agenda by arguing Britain can no longer afford it. Greenpeace is already pursuing a judicial review for alleged insufficient lack of consultation on nuclear power, and has been further antagonised by a perceived lack of transparency over submissions made to Weightman. Anti-nuclear protesters are infuriated that EDF, the French state-owned energy company at the heart of the UK's new nuclear plans, has started preparatory work on a facility at Hinkley Point in Somerset ahead of the report's publication. The Department of Energy and Climate Change insisted no one had jumped the gun with new projects and said it would still take into account any changes or demands made by the final report. It denied that the government's hold on nuclear or wider energy policy was slipping, pointing out, for example, that although the power company SSE wants to sell its stake in Sellafield, it would be taken over by another operator. But German utility group RWE is also known to be reconsidering its commitment to the Horizon joint venture, which is looking at plans to build new stations at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. Meanwhile, talks between Scottish Power and the energy department for a prototype CCS scheme are close to collapse. Greenpeace said the Weightman report \"pre-empted\" many of the lessons from Fukushima, which could only be learned a year or 18 months down the line. The campaign group also points out that Weightman promised \"to publish all submissions on the Office of Nuclear Regulation website as they are received\", which has yet to happen. But Charles Hendry, the energy minister, told a fringe meeting that people were still behind atomic power. \"Fukushima was a massive wake-up call and reminds us we can never rely on just one technology,\" he said. \"But on public opinion, it has been quite extraordinary to see the reaction since Fukushima.

Reading the hostile comments underneath an article outlining his objections to GM foods on the Guardian website, he decided his critics were probably right. A couple of years later, Lynas had another eureka moment when he read Stewart Brand's book, Whole Earth Discipline, in which the American writer tore up the green rulebook and came out in favour of urbanisation, nuclear power and genetic engineering. A few months ago, Lynas appeared in a TV documentary, What the Green Movement Got Wrong, alongside Brand – and inside the ruins of Chernobyl which, he argued, had not been nearly as devastating a disaster as most people think. Next week Lynas publishes a new book, The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans, in which he takes his argument with the green movement a step further. The book accuses the greens of having helped cause climate change through their opposition to nuclear power, and calls this a \"gargantuan error, and one that will echo down the ages\". \"Anyone who still marches against nuclear today,\" he writes, \"as many thousands of people did in Germany following the Fukushima accident, is in my view just as bad for the climate as textbook eco-villains like the big oil companies.\" The idea for Lynas's new book came to him in another \"moment of revelation\" two years ago. Lynas, who is a part-time climate adviser to the Maldives government (he is also a visiting researcher at Oxford university), was invited to sit in on the meetings of a group of scientists in Sweden. The group were aiming to flesh out the concept of \"planetary boundaries\", coined by sustainability expert Johan Rockström. The best-known of these so-called boundaries is the climate-change one – the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But there are boundaries too for biodiversity, nitrogen, and ocean acidification. The idea is that, beyond these limits, Earth's systems will begin to break down. Lynas's revelation was that these new rules about how to live on Earth should immediately replace many older green ideas, and over drinks he and Rockström agreed that Lynas would write a book with the aim of popularising them. But the most attention-grabbing passages in the book come in Lynas's denunciations of the green movement, and when we talk he makes no attempt to play them down. Instead he draws my attention to his blog, where over the past fortnight he has enthusiastically joined in attacks on a recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report on renewable energy. And he argues that \"the green movement in itself is dying – I'm an environmentalist but not a green\". Lynas, who describes himself as a \"recovering activist\", was involved in direct action in his student days. He joined protests against the Newbury bypass and Manchester airport, and was heavily involved in the anti-GM movement of the 1990s, ripping up sweetcorn and sugarbeet crops from fields in East Anglia, and on occasion being chased by police and police dogs. But is he a maverick iconoclast, stirring up controversy for the media by turning on his old allies? Or are the views expressed in his book symptomatic of broader divisions? Eighteen months after the failure of the Copenhagen climate summit, there are signs of wider frustration. With no sign of progress in setting global emissions limits, a steady stream of reports gives cause for alarm to those who are already worried. Last week it was the turn of the oceans, with a warning about pollution and overfishing, last month a sudden upsurge in Amazon deforestation. This week climate sceptic Michele Bachmann launched her bid to become the next US president, while the EU was forced to put off a vote toughening emissions targets following reports that Tory MEPs were planning to reject it. \"People think that getting some publicity, having some tea with a minister and civil servants, lobbying parliamentarians, is making a difference, but it's not,\" says Charles Secrett, the former Friends of the Earth director who two weeks ago wrote an article accusing the organisation of being bureaucratic and out of touch. \"Protest ain't going to win the day. Nor is a sort of incremental engagement with government and industry. The movement as a whole has got to collaborate more, pool resources – money, staff, ideas – and generate real cross-party pressure.\" Novelist Ian McEwan spent years researching renewable energy for his 2010 novel, Solar, and says when he began \"there was a positive mood for action, a public awakening. Now I think everyone has fallen back to sleep. Copenhagen was something of a fiasco, and the UEA emails didn't help. And the ideological deniers are well organised. At this point I don't see change coming from a bottom-up process, from a kind of peasants' revolt. I think the consumer moment has passed and people have got bored.\" This feeling of a missed opportunity, and of 2009 as a high-water mark in public engagement with the issues, finds many echoes. Though activists trumpet their recent successes in having seen off the third runway at Heathrow and a new fleet of coal-fired power stations, as well as helping persuade David Cameron to commit the UK to a strict timetable for cutting emissions, they admit that disappointment after Copenhagen, and uncertainty about the future, have been difficult to manage. Tamsin Omond of direct action group Climate Rush remembers this is a heady time. \"2009 was the year we said we would do one action a month, and we did. Everyone saw this as the one chance and the feeling of momentum – that we only had to work really hard until December, and then we could have a rest – was really present. Everything we did would get in the papers and journalists were phoning up all the time. I was completely caught up in it.\" I was caught up in it myself: in 2009 I joined the Green party and stood as a candidate in a council byelection a few months before Caroline Lucas was elected Britain's first Green MP. It was the year Age of Stupid director Franny Armstrong had the idea for 10:10, on her way to a debate with Ed Miliband, and launched the campaign at Tate Modern and in a special issue of G2. And it was the year newspapers around the world, led by the Guardian in an unprecedented gesture of editorial solidarity, printed the same leading article demanding action on global warming on their front pages. Post-Copenhagen, consensus is harder to find. The recent ructions boil down to three issues. The first is nuclear power, with Guardian columnist George Monbiot, former Greenpeace director Stephen Tindale and McEwan among those to agree with Lynas that atomic energy is vital if we are to wean the world off fossil fuels. Another disagreement is summed up by Charles Secrett's complaints about Friends of the Earth. Some activists believe that the big, long-established NGOs need to get better at mobilising their supporters and achieving a greater degree of focus and coordination, as well as building up links with nimbler and more dynamic direct-action campaigns. But the biggest issue of all is the nature of environmental politics. Is the green movement a leftwing, anti-capitalist movement? Mark Lynas believes it is, and that those who style themselves as greens should be marginalised and allowed to die off so that they can be replaced by a new breed of market-friendly environmentalists like him. \"If it becomes a culture war like the debate over abortion or something, you can't win,\" he says. \"I want an environmental movement that is happy with capitalism, which goes out there and says yes rather than no, and is rigorous about the way it treats science. The green movement needs a clause-four moment – the Labour party had to go through that.\" Those within the green mainstream reject this analysis outright. Jonathon Porritt argues that social justice is intrinsic to the sustainability agenda, while Greenpeace director John Sauven points out that the charity has worked closely with all the main political parties in Britain and with multinational corporations abroad. \"It's a very broad camp, isn't it? On the one hand you've got the anti-capitalists, and then you've got quite a strong body within the Conservative party that takes the environmental agenda very seriously – John Gummer's quality of life report was an excellent piece of work.\" He believes Lynas over-eggs the nuclear point, and that the power of the economic and political interests aligned against change – above all the US fossil fuel lobby – must be understood. Others point out that there is already a strong emphasis on green growth and development, and the economic opportunity represented by the new industrial revolution that we need to carry us into a post-carbon world. But Lynas is not alone in believing that the intense focus on aviation has been offputting, and there is general agreement that Britain must learn from the US, where many Tea Party supporters believe climate science is a socialist conspiracy. This week energy minister Greg Barker suggested that a debate started by Margaret Thatcher had been hijacked by the centre left. Campaigners cite the Heathrow and forestry protests as examples of what a broader coalition of interests can achieve if they go about it in the right way. Climate Rush's Tamsin Omond coordinated a \"Saving the Forests\" letter to the Daily Telegraph with The Lady editor Rachel Johnson, and says: \"If we haven't been good enough at appealing to people across the board then we are missing a trick. We are all on the same planet, we have a ballooning population, diminishing resources and a changing climate, and we really need to grow up and see the situation for what it is. You can say these things to people who have never voted anything other than Tory. I have said them and I don't think it's impossible at all. We need to be talking to everyone.\" McEwan says the green movement is not to blame if climate change has slipped down the agenda. \"I think it's got a lot to do with human nature. Most issues have a narrative, with the sense of an ending or resolution – the referendum is passed, the government falls – but this really is a lifetime story, and not just our lifetime, but our children's and their children's. We are decades away from the point where we say, 'We've finally deflected the rising curve of Co2 emissions, so let's have one last push to fix it for good.' We've made no impact on this rising curve as yet, and it's hard to keep interest and optimism alive.\" And he adds: \"I've never voted for the Tories, but I'd make my judgments at the next general election based entirely on the respective parties' attitudes and intentions in matters of climate change. This is the overwhelming issue that encloses all others. If Cameron and friends came up with a more feasible and effective plan than Miliband, then I would have to vote for it. I think that's all we, as citizens, can do.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/apr/17/why-cant-we-give-up-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-17T16:49:00Z","webTitle":"Why can't we quit fossil fuels?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/17/why-cant-we-give-up-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/apr/17/why-cant-we-give-up-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Why can't we quit fossil fuels?","bodyText":"We have far more oil, coal and gas than we can safely burn. For all the millions of words written about climate change, the challenge really comes down to this: fuel is enormously useful, massively valuable and hugely important geopolitically, but tackling global warming means leaving most of it in the ground – by choice. Although we often hear more about green technology, consumption levels or population growth, leaving fuel in the ground is the crux of the issue. After all, the climate doesn't know or care how much renewable or nuclear energy we've got, how efficient our cars and homes are, how many people there are, or even how we run the economy. It only cares how much globe-warming pollution we emit – and that may be curiously immune to the measures we usually assume will help. There are three facts that tell you all you really need to know about climate science and politics. One: for all the uncertainty about the detail, every science academy in the world accepts the mainstream view of man-made global warming. Two: virtually every government, recognising the profound danger of tampering with the climate that allowed human society to thrive, has agreed the world must limit the global temperature increase to 2C – a level which isn't by any means \"safe\" but may be enough to avoid the worst impacts. Three: the amount of warming we will experience goes up roughly in proportion to the total amount of carbon that global society emits – cumulatively. Here is the rub. Even if we gave up on all the obscure and unconventional fossil fuel resources that companies are spending billions trying to access and just burned the \"proven\" oil, coal and gas reserves – the ones that are already economically viable – we would emit almost 3tn tonnes of carbon dioxide. No one can say exactly how much warming that would cause, but it is overwhelmingly likely that we would shoot well past 2C and towards 3C or even 4C of warming. Four degrees might not sound much but at the planetary level it is. It is about the same as the temperature increase observed since the ice age's \"last glacial maximum\", when much of the northern hemisphere was trapped under ice as thick as the world's five tallest skyscrapers stacked on top of each other. It is impossible to say what changes another three or four degrees would bring, but the impacts could very plausibly include a collapse in global food production, catastrophic droughts and floods, heatwaves and the beginning of ice-sheet melt that could eventually raise the sea level enough to wipe out many of the world's great cities. Sceptics argue that this doomsday scenario might not come to pass – and they are right. If we are lucky, the impact of burning all that oil, coal and gas could turn out to be at the less severe end of the plausible spectrum. But that is hardly reassuring: it's akin to saying that it is fine to walk blindfolded into a main road since you can't be sure there are any cars coming. After less than 1C of temperature increase so far, we are already seeing some profound changes, including a collapse in Arctic sea ice coverage more severe than even the most pessimistic predictions from just a few years ago. (Brits secretly hoping for a hotter future, be warned: that collapsing sea ice may have caused the freakish jet stream behaviour that made 2012 the wettest English year on record and obliterated this year's spring, both mere amuse-bouche for the feast of climate impacts expected in coming decades, even from the carbon we've emitted so far.) Given what is at stake, it is no wonder that governments agree global warming must be stopped. But that is where the common sense ends and the cognitive dissonance begins. Because to have a decent chance of not exceeding the already risky global target, we need to start phasing out fossil fuels now at a fast enough rate to bring down emissions globally by a few percent a year, and continue doing so for decades to come. Now compare that with what is actually happening. As with the climate, to understand the situation properly it is necessary to zoom right out to see the long-term trend. Doing so reveals something fascinating, worrying and oddly overlooked. As scientists from Lancaster University pointed out last year, if you plot a graph showing all the carbon emissions that humans have pumped into the air, the result is a remarkably clear exponential curve stretching all the way back to the mid-19th century. Zoom back in on the past decade and it is clear that for all the mounting scientific concern, the political rhetoric and the clean technology, nothing has made a jot of difference to the long-term trend at the global level – the system level. The growth rate in total carbon emissions in the past decade, at around 2% a year, was the same as that of the 1850s. That might sound hard to believe. After all, thanks to green policies and technologies, emissions have been falling in Europe, the US and many other countries. Wind turbines and solar panels are ever-more common, not just in the west but in fast-growing China. And the energy efficiency of cars, light bulbs, homes and whole economies has been improving globally for decades. So why isn't the carbon curve showing any let up? Some might instinctively want to blame the growing population but that doesn't stack up. The rate of population growth has dropped like a stone since the 1960s and is no longer exponential, but the carbon curve doesn't appear to have noticed that any more than it has noticed the Kyoto protocol or whether you cycled to work this morning. For whatever reason, cutting carbon has so far been like squeezing a balloon: gains made in one place have been cancelled out by increases elsewhere. To understand what is going wrong, it is necessary to consider the nature of exponential growth. This type of accelerating trend crops up when there is a feedback loop at work. For example, a credit card debt grows exponentially because interest gets applied to ever more interest. The number of algae in a jar grows in the same way: as long as there is food and air, there will be more algae and so they can breed faster.The fact that our carbon emissions have followed the same accelerating trend suggests that our use of energy is driven by a similar kind of feedback loop which is cancelling out apparent green gains. That certainly fits with history. The industrial revolution that kick-started the human impact on the climate was driven by just such a feedback. The steam engine enabled us to drain coal mines, providing access to more coal that could power more steam engines capable of extracting yet more coal. That led to better technologies and materials that eventually helped ramp up production of oil as well. But oil didn't displace coal, it helped us mine it more effectively and stimulated more technologies that raised energy demand overall. So coal use kept rising too – and oil use in turn kept increasing as cleaner gas, nuclear and hydro came on stream, helping power the digital age, which unlocked more advanced technologies capable of opening up harder-to-read fossil-fuel reserves. Seen as a technology-driven feedback loop, it is not surprising that nothing has yet tamed the global emissions curve, because so far nothing has cut off its food supply: fossil fuels. Indeed, though our governments now subsidise clean-power sources and efficient cars and buildings – and encourage us all to use less energy – they are continuing to undermine all that by ripping as much oil, coal and gas out of the ground as possible. And if their own green policies mean there isn't a market for these fuels at home, then no matter: they can just be exported instead. This extraordinary double-think is everywhere to be seen. Take the US. Obama boasts that American emissions are now falling due to rising auto efficiency standards and gas displacing dirtier coal in the energy mix. But the US is extracting carbon and flowing it into the global energy system faster than ever before. Its gas boom has simply allowed it to export more of the coal to other countries such as China – which of course uses it partly to produce goods for US markets. Not happy with increasing US carbon extraction, Obama is also set to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline that will enable Canada to flood the global markets with crude produced from dirty tar sands. So much for carbon cuts. Or take Australia, which in the same year introduced a carbon tax and started debating plans for a series of \"mega-mines\" that would massively increase its coal exports, helping build confidence among the companies and governments planning no fewer than 1,200 new coal-fired power stations around the world. Even the UK, with its world-leading carbon targets, gives tax-breaks to encourage oil and gas recovery and has been growing its total carbon footprint by relying ever more on Chinese factories – and therefore indirectly its reliance on American and Australian coal. And not just that. Although it rarely gets commented on, Britain – along with other supposedly green nations such as Germany – regularly begs Saudi Arabia and the other Opec nations to produce not less oil, but more. As journalist George Monbiot once put it, nations are trying simultaneously to \"reduce demand for fossil fuels and increase supply\". It is not just governments that are in near-universal denial about what needs to happen to the fossil fuel sector. Blithely ignoring the fact that there is already far more accessible fuel than can be safely burned, pension fund managers and other investors are allowing listed fossil fuel companies to spend the best part of $1tn a year (comparable to the US defence budget, or more than $100 for every person on the planet) to find and develop yet more reserves. If and when we emerge from this insanity, the carbon bubble will burst and those investments will turn out to have been as toxic as sub-prime mortgages. Don't take my word for it. HSBC analysts recently concluded that oil giants such as BP – beloved of UK pension funds – could have their value cut in half if the world decides to tackle climate change. Coal companies can expect an even rougher ride, and yet our financial regulators still allow them to float on stock markets without mentioning in their share prospectuses that their assets may soon need to be written off. But for now, the fuel is still flowing freely. And for as long as that continues, the global energy feedback loop will ensure that many of the things we assume will help may be ineffective – or even counterproductive. More efficient engines may simply enable more people to drive more cars over greater distances, triggering more road building, more trade and indeed more big suburban houses that take more energy to heat. New renewable or nuclear power sources might just lead to more economic activity, increasing demand and supply of all energy sources, including fossil fuels. And local carbon cuts caused by green choices, population decline or even new economic models may simply free up more fuel for use elsewhere. Of course, oil, coal and gas use will level off eventually no matter what we do. Fossil fuels are a finite resource and each year they get more expensive relative to renewables and nuclear. But given the continued acceleration not just in fossil fuel extraction but in the production of cars, boilers, furnaces and power plants that need oil, coal and gas to function, there is zero prospect of that happening of its own accord any time soon. Forget peak oil caused by dwindling supplies. At least until we've cracked cheap carbon capture, we need to bring about peak fossil fuels. Voluntarily. And soon. We know how to do it. A properly designed global cap and trade scheme is one option. Stiff taxes on the production or sale of carbon-based fuels is another. Or we could simply oblige companies taking carbon out of the ground to arrange for a rising share of what they extract to be buried again. Any of these models could bring down global emissions and stimulate an explosion of investment and innovation in clean and efficient energy systems. But there is no avoiding the unpalatable side-effects: spiralling fuel and energy prices; a write-off of fuel reserves worth many trillions of dollars; and a fierce global squabble about how to share out the fuels we do decide to burn. How would all this affect the global economy, or pension funds, or the financial health of the Middle East, the US and other carbon-rich nations doing most to resist a global climate deal? For all the confident opinion on both sides, no one can say for sure, just as no one can be certain how human society will fare in a warming world. But with so much money and power bound up with oil, coal and gas, one thing seems clear: constraining global fossil fuel supplies will take bigger thinking, harder politics and – crucially – a whole lot more public pressure. Voluntary carbon cuts are a great start but they are no match for a system-level feedback in human energy use. Globally, the vast majority of people want climate change dealt with. But can we bring ourselves to prioritise a safe planet over cheap fuels, flights, power and goods? Can we face calling on our leaders to end the double-think and constrain oil, coal and gas supplies on our behalf? Can humanity muster the restraint and cooperation needed to leave assets worth trillions in the ground?

Indian commentators hailed the nation's membership of the elite club of nations possessing such weapons and TV channels looped footage of the test off the country's eastern seaboard. \"It will be a quantum leap in India's strategic capability,\" said Ravi Gupta, spokesman for India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the government agency which built the missile. \"Agni-V is a game-changer and a technological marvel,\" VK Saraswat, scientific adviser to the defence minister, was quoted as telling the Hindu newspaper. In Beijing, the state-run Global Times grumbled that \"India [was] being swept up by missile delusion\" and warned China's neighbour could never hope to win an \"overall arms race\". Gaps between macho public rhetoric in the two emerging powers and reality is nothing new. India's chaotic and colourful media are always quick to seize on evidence of aggressive Chinese intentions, whether that be a new alleged border incursion, a new aid initiative to a neighbour or some undiplomatic language. Listening to some TV pundits as you fix your masala chai, eggs and paratha in the morning you would be forgiven for thinking that war was imminent. India and China have of course fought before, in 1962. Then Delhi's forces, ill-equipped, unprepared and badly led came off much the worse. This has left its scars, as have the three more or less victorious wars India has fought on its other frontier against Pakistan. The result is something of a siege mentality which could be considered odd in a country of 1.2 billion with a $1.5tn (£930bn) economy that dwarfs all but one of its neighbours. Security and foreign affairs experts describing the launch of the Agni-V, which could strike Beijing or Shanghai, played down its immediate impact. Not only was trade between China and India booming, predicted to be worth $100bn within two years, but leaders in both countries, after a rough patch at the end of the last decade, appeared to have taken deliberate decisions to build a stable, secure partnership, said Dr C Raja Mohan, of Delhi's Observer research Foundation. \"India is now getting the full panoply of what it means to be a nuclear power. It is a deterrent to China but it does not mean that the relationship with China will go bad,\" he said. Rukmani Gupta, associate fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis in Delhi, said India was neither expecting a conflict with China nor seeking to change the balance of power as \"Indian-Chinese relations are extremely stable\". It will be many years before the missile can actually be used in anger – and even more before a submarine-launched version could be introduced. \"There's a lot more testing to do. The [Agni-V] may only be deployed by the end of the decade. A lot of the commentary has been over the top,\" said Manoj Joshi, a security expert and analyst. The launch is part of a giant modernisation programme of India's military capability that will eventually cost hundreds of billions of dollars over many decades. Joshi pointed out that the missiles were being developed by the Defence Research Development Organisation without much oversight from policymakers. \"It's worrying that government scientists can issue press releases and make statements that could have an impact on policy,\" Joshi said. In a country where technological wizards and soldiers are hugely respected locally, military scientists are heroes. The former president was an aerospace engineer who worked on the Agni-V's predecessors. Another reason for the celebration in India is that currently only the permanent members of the UN security council have missiles of such capability. India has long demanded a seat on the council and, despite the ostensible support of countries such as the US and the UK, is unlikely to receive one soon. This could be seen as one way of elbowing a path to the top table."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/oct/13/nuclear-greenfield-sites-scrapped","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-13T20:18:12Z","webTitle":"Greenfield sites dropped from list of new nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/13/nuclear-greenfield-sites-scrapped","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/oct/13/nuclear-greenfield-sites-scrapped","fields":{"headline":"Greenfield sites dropped from list of new nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The government has scrapped plans to build nuclear reactors on greenfield sites, according to documents seen by the Guardian, in the latest blow to the industry's stuttering programme. Two sites – at Kirksanton and Braystones in Cumbria – appear to have been dropped from a list that could be announced as early as next week. German energy firm RWE paid undisclosed sums last year for the two sites, which are large enough for two reactors each and are near Sellafield, the biggest employer in the region. The eight remaining sites in England and Wales are all near existing reactors. These will be put forward for another round of consultation when the government publishes its revised national energy policy statements. Today two documents appeared on the Department of Energy and Climate Change's website which said that Kirkstanton and Braystones had not been found suitable \"for the deployment of a nuclear power station by 2025\" and were therefore \"not within the revised draft nuclear NPS [national policy statement]\". The documents, apparently published by mistake, were quickly removed. The department declined to comment. Nuclear companies believe the government's abolition of the new planning quango, the Infrastructure Planning Commission, will make it harder to get permission for new reactors, particularly on greenfield sites. Jean McSorley, a Greenpeace consultant who lives in Cumbria and has campaigned against the planned reactors there, said: \"The apparent withdrawal of these two sites, in the heartland of the nuclear industry, is excellent news for local people. The nuclear industry and Copeland district council assumed that local people would accept the plans. Dropping the only greenfield sites put forward for new reactors in the UK also strikes a blow for the government's new-build programme.\" Alison Chappell, head of nuclear development at RWE npower said: \"We cannot comment on speculation regarding the NPS until the latest version is released. The NPS is due to be published soon and we await this with interest and are likely to respond to the consultation.\" RWE has set up a consortium with rival German energy firm E.ON to build two reactors, in Anglesey and Gloucestershire. EDF bought nuclear generator British Energy two years ago on the eve of the recession when energy prices and company valuations started to plummet. Electricity prices are about half that needed to make nuclear generation economically viable, while construction costs have soared. Companies have given the coalition a list of subsidies – what they call \"market mechanisms\" – without which they say they will not invest the billions of pounds required."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/dec/13/chernobyl-now-open-to-tourists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-13T17:31:30Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl: now open to tourists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/13/chernobyl-now-open-to-tourists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/13/chernobyl-now-open-to-tourists","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl: now open to tourists","bodyText":"Already been to North Korea? Hiking in Afghanistan a little bit too last year? Fear not. Tourism has a new frontier: the site of the world's biggest civilian nuclear disaster. From next year the heavily contaminated area around the Chernobyl power plant will be officially open to tourists with an interest in post-apocalyptic vistas, late-period Soviet history, or both. Ukraine's emergency situations ministry said today that visitors would be offered tours inside the 30-mile exclusion zone set up after reactor four at the plant exploded on 26 April 1986, showering northern Europe in radioactive fallout. The disaster killed an unknown number of people – estimates for deaths from radiation exposure range from dozens to thousands – and forced around 350,000 people to leave their homes forever. While the area remains heavily contaminated, a ministry spokeswoman said, tourism routes had been drawn up which would cover the main sights while steering clear of the dangerous spots. Wandering would not be encouraged, Yulia Yershova said: \"There are things to see there if one follows the official route and doesn't stray away from the group.\" It is already possible to visit the area with private tour firms, usually operating from Ukraine's capital, Kiev, 60 miles south. The country's government, however, says these are illegal and tourists' safety cannot be guaranteed. The itinerary of one such tour, which takes in the nuclear plant and even the remains of the number four reactor, contains elements as lunch (food is delivered from outside of the Chernobyl zone), passage through the Dytyatky control point and measuring of radiation. Apart from seeing the remnants of one of the late 20th century's most dramatic events, trips to the exclusion zone offer visitors a peek into a macabre, Mary Celeste world where tens of thousands of homes were abandoned. Particularly chilling is Prypyat, once a 50,000-strong city but now a ghost town, where books still sit on school desks and May Day decorations flutter in the streets. The plant itself, which kept generating power until 2000, still has 2,500 staff making the site safe, working in strict shifts to minimise radiation exposure. Ukraine's government said that it hoped to complete a new sarcophagus for the exploded reactor by 2015. The existing concrete structure is cracking and leaks radiation. • This article was amended on 15 December 2010. The original referred to the Marie Celeste.

Whatever happened to Holland-Germany animosity?","bodyText":"Commentators in the British media may indulge in a fair share of German-bashing, but that's nothing to what I grew up with. Growing up in the Netherlands in the 70s and 80s, anti-German feelings seemed as natural as cheese, skating and gay rights. Germans really were \"the other\" – humourless closet-fascists who had destroyed the magnificent port of Rotterdam, then occupied and pillaged our country for five years, murdering 80% of our Jews. It was genuine hatred, often, and never did those feelings boil over more spectacularly than in football – European club football, but even more so in national matches. The apotheosis came with the World Cup final of 1974, when the referee fell for a schwalbe (taking a dive) and awarded Germany an undeserved penalty kick. \"We've been had again!\", the Dutch commentator exclaimed, alluding to the Nazis' surprise attack in May of 1940. But 72 years after that infamous invasion, something has changed. Tonight the Netherlands play Germany at Euro 2012 and in some quarters the match again gets billed as Europe's most intense football rivalry. Perhaps. God knows I want the Dutch to win tonight, as do millions of my compatriots. But the shrill undertone seems to have vanished from it all. Damn! Where have my anti-German feelings gone? One element must be the European Championships of 1988 when the Dutch beat Germany in Hamburg and went on to win a major football tournament for the first (and last) time. That felt like liberation all over again, and in retrospect it was cathartic. I'm told the Danish went through something similar after beating Germany in 1992 to become European champions. Then there are the tectonic geo-political shifts. As the Dutch were busy hating the Germans during the cold war, they embraced Anglo-Saxon culture and politics. But in the past decade America elected, then re-elected George W Bush – the antithesis of everything the Dutch hold dear, from abortion to euthanasia to gay rights to environmental responsibility. Trying to be good allies the Dutch (and the Danes) let themselves be dragged into the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq. Meanwhile the Germans said \"no\" from the beginning, famously challenging Donald Rumsfeld by saying \"you have to make the case\". There was no case, and the Germans called it. The United States and the United Kingdom deregulated the world of finance, allowing an enormous mortgage fraud for which the Dutch are paying every day. Meanwhile Germany ran the most successful economy in Europe, astutely avoiding a housing boom. These days the Dutch and the German see eye to eye on the need for southern Europe to carry out the same structural reforms that our countries went through. When it comes to the Netherlands' number one foreign policy objective, our chief ally is now Germany. Did I mention that Germany offers massive subsidies to solar power, catapulting the industry ahead, and promises to phase out nuclear power? It is also the only major economy to take on privacy violators like Google. And as Germany is becoming a country to look up to, the Netherlands is fast becoming a country to be ashamed of – making anti-German feelings even harder to harbour. For years now the majority in my country has been looking on helplessly as a very loud minority tears up centuries of co-existence and enlightened pragmatism (always cleverly sold to foreigners as \"tolerance\"). A jihadist murdered film director and columnist Theo van Gogh, who in turn never used the term \"Muslims\", preferring \"goat fuckers\" instead. Recently, Theodor Holman, one of the most prominent columnists and playwrights in the country wrote that he felt great affinity with the goals of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik - though not with the means Breivik chose to use. The crypto-fascist PVV party of Geert Wilders is consistently polling in the top three. But weren't anti-German feelings all about replaying the second world war? Well, over the past decades historians took care of that, all but destroying the myth of the \"Dutch resistance\". No European country participated as fully with the deportation of Jews, and no European country outside Germany saw so few of them return. Very few European countries saw so many eager volunteers for the eastern front. If the Germans were Hitler's willing executioners, in Daniel Goldhagen's phrase, then the Dutch were Hitler's willing bystanders – or worse. All of which makes it increasingly hard to project our dark side on the Germans, by now the only major mainland European country to keep its own crypto-fascist fringes in check. So I'll be there tonight, my face painted and wearing the mandatory orange shirt. I can't be alone in mourning the loss of my superiority complex, and the justification it offered to revel in chauvinistic hysteria. Boy, will I miss shouting \"vuile moffen\" (\"vile Krauts\") at the television screen. The Dutch could start hating the English, of course, given how their politicians abet a financial sector that is fleecing our continent. But it's just not the same. For one thing, the English national team just isn't good enough. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/nov/19/roche-german-proposal-nuclear-wulff","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-19T20:03:18Z","webTitle":"Charlotte Roche offers sex (with strings attached) to Germany's president Wulff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/19/roche-german-proposal-nuclear-wulff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/nov/19/roche-german-proposal-nuclear-wulff","fields":{"headline":"Charlotte Roche offers sex (with strings attached) to Germany's president Wulff","bodyText":"Until recently she was best known for her international best-seller Wetlands, a frank debut novel about the sex life of an 18-year-old that has been described as everything from literary eroticism to undiluted pornography. Now Charlotte Roche, a 32-year-old, British-born German TV presenter, has found further fame after sending an invitation to the German president. \"I'm offering to go to bed with him if he refuses to sign into law the extension of the country's nuclear power stations,\" she told Der Spiegel. Whether or not she is now embarrassed by her own daring – perhaps unlikely given her well-documented record of thriving on provocation – Roche refused a request to talk further on the topic, saying she had said all that needed to be said. In a statement, however, she explained that her overture to Christian Wulff was a matter of life and death, driven by fear for her own future and that of her children. \"My husband is in agreement. Now it's just up to the first lady to agree to it,\" she said, offering an added incentive: \"I am tattooed.\" At stake is the future of nuclear energy in Germany, which has become the source of furious debate following the recent announcement by the government of Angela Merkel that it was planning to extend the lifespan of the country's 17 nuclear power stations by a further 12 years. Merkel was accused of kowtowing to the powerful energy sector, which is set to make billions from the deal, and of threatening the future of the renewable energy industry. The new policy amounts to an effective U-turn on pervious, ground-breaking legislation passed by Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrat and Green government, which would have seen nuclear power phased out in just over a decade's time. Now it is unlikely to happen before 2035. Wulff can either decide to sign the law, thus riding roughshod over the opposition, or take the more constitutional route and let it go through the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, which is unlikely to pass it. Hence what has been coined Roche's \"sex for a veto\" offer. Earlier this month Roche, who admits she had never previously been on a protest march, joined anti-nuclear activists at major demonstrations against the rail and road transport of radioactive waste to a storage facility in northern Germany. Donning red wellington boots, Roche boarded one of hundreds of tractors to take part in the protest, which attracted 50,000 demonstrators, some of whom chained themselves to railway tracks and tree branches. Herds of sheep were used in an attempt to halt the transport of spent fuel rods between a nuclear reprocessing plant in Le Hague, France, and a deep-earth storage facility in Gorleben, Germany. \"This year the government has radicalised me,\" she told German radio. \"Sometimes I could almost cry in anger ... I'm totally against the fact that we're producing terrible, fatal, poisonous rubbish, without knowing where to put it.\" Roche has latched on to the renaissance of a movement that dates back to the 1970s, when protesters at grassroots level first campaigned against the construction of a nuclear power plant at Wyhl in south-west Germany. Nuclear accidents, such as Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 galvanised support. Ironically, the decision of the Schröder government to phase out nuclear power took much of the wind out of the sails of the campaign. Merkel's reversal has now had the opposite effect and prompted thousands of new protesters from across the political and social spectrum to sign up to the reignited cause. \"The best way to explain the recent protests is that many people have the feeling that fewer and fewer things are being decided democratically,\" said Gesine Agena, 23, a member of the Green party's youth wing who has been described as one of the new faces of the protest movement. \"Political elites are pushing through decisions they've already made regardless of what the citizen on the street thinks of them.\" The banking crisis has only magnified a feeling of exclusion. According to Dieter Rucht of the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin: \"This is driving people to the barricades who don't normally go out on to the streets.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/live/2014/sep/23/un-climate-change-summit-in-new-york-live-coverage","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-23T22:23:35Z","webTitle":"UN climate change summit in New York – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/live/2014/sep/23/un-climate-change-summit-in-new-york-live-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/live/2014/sep/23/un-climate-change-summit-in-new-york-live-coverage","fields":{"headline":"UN climate change summit in New York – as it happened","bodyText":"I will now wrap up the live blog. The summit will culminate in a closing ceremony in the next hour or two. The Guardian’s Suzanne Goldenberg has written a wrap up of today’s major events, including France’s major commitment to the Green Climate Fund. I recommend the efforts of the live teams at Responding to Climate Change and the World Resources Institute as the evening goes on. Most of the major announcements and speeches have been made. Over the coming days expect to see plenty of analysis to determine whether this summit will end up in the ‘historic momentum builder’ box or the ‘bilious talkfest’ box or somewhere in between. Much of the initial reaction has been positive. A lot of focus will be on the concrete monetary commitments made by France and other nations, including forensic examination to find out how much of this money is genuinely new and how much amounts to old promises with new names. Here is a summary of events from the day: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon opened the session telling leaders from across the world: “We are not here to talk, we are here to make history” Actor Leonardo DiCaprio told leaders they had a choice: “You can make history or you will be vilified for it” France joined Germany in pledging $1bn of climate aid over the next few years A number of smaller developed economies pledged almost $300 million to the Green Climate Fund US president Barack Obama pushed China to redraw the “old divisions” between rich and poor nations and take on the responsibility of a “big nation” Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli committed to double the country’s contribution to a “South-South” fund which will help developing nations adapt to climate change. UK prime minister David Cameron urged a global agreement in Paris but failed to join France and Germany as leading EU economies pledged large sums to the Green Climate Fund A major declaration on forests was signed by 27 governments and more than 100 companies and organisations. It committed to end global deforestation by 2030 In Britain, Greenpeace protesters have taken over a freight train en route to a coal power plant A number of nations made commitments to significantly reduce carbon emissions and grow renewable energy Finally, after a day of new commitments to the Green Climate Fund, how close is the fund to reaching its target of US$15 billion ambition before the Lima climate conference in December? Further to the German announcement to end coal development finance, which apparently was announced last week, Jan Kowalzig from Oxfam Germany says the announcement is “only part of the story”. Kowalzig says: “It applies to development finance only; it does not apply to the finance provided through the IPEX, the export credit subsidiary of the government bank KfW. In the past, more than half of such government backed financing for coal overseas went via the IPEX. So despite today’s announcement, the government has not ruled out financing new coal power stations overseas, despite all the rhetoric about cutting emissions, global transformation – and the German “Energiewende”.” Friends of the Earth’s campaigns and policy director Craig Bennett says David Cameron’s allusion to fracking as “lower carbon” in his speech earlier today “is like trying to sell cigarettes at a hospital”. “Twenty-first century problems need twenty-first century solutions: If we want to build a cleaner, safer future we must switch to renewable power and end our dirty addiction to fossil fuels. “With clean renewable power becoming ever cheaper, available now and accessible to ordinary people, we simply don’t need to frack. It’s at best a red herring and at worst a dangerous folly.” Interesting New York Times graphic showing China has the most citizens vulnerable to coastal flooding. Correction: Germany has promised to end development finance for new coal power stations, not for domestic coal power stations as stated earlier. H/T Oxfam America. Another piece of positive reaction to the speech made by China’s vice premier today. Greenpeace senior policy officer Li Shuo said: “Five years after Copenhagen, China is in a vastly different position. Domestic air pollution is forcing the country to embark on a new path away from coal and 2014 saw the lowest coal consumption growth in a decade. After the surging carbon emissions over the past decade, we welcome the Vice Premier’s pledge to peak emissions as early as possible, and call on China to peak its greenhouse gas emission much before 2025. The country must also capitalize on its domestic progress on coal and deliver an ambitious post-2020 target.” According to Responding to Climate Change Saudi Arabia’s representative has pushed back against calls for a carbon price. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the oil giant’s minister petroleum and mineral resources, Ali Naimi, said a price on emissions would “undermine the principle of justice and equity”. RTCC reports: Naimi said: “Saudi Arabia believes firmly that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions must be achieved without affecting economic growth.” He says that Saudi has taken efforts towards economic diversification as a step towards more sustainable development.” The World Resource Institute reports that the Swedish National Pension Fund will divest $100 billion worth of assets before the Paris conference in 2015. The World Resource Institute reports that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan expects and explosion in green capital in the next six years. Moynihan said his company predicts the global green bond market will grow to $300 billion by 2020. That’s up from the $40 billion in green bonds expected to be issued in 2014, and the $11 billion issued in 2013.Green bonds are bonds are securities meant to raise capital to finance low-carbon investments. This echoes earlier statements from World Bank president Jim Yong Kim. Forests have been a prominent topic in todays discussions and a major initiative has been announced to cut the rate of deforestation in half by 2020 and end it by 2030. The New York Declaration on Forests has 130 signatories, including the governments of the US, UK, Germany, Indonesia and the Congo, as well as companies, civil society and indigenous peoples. The declaration also calls for the restoration of more than 350 million hectares of forests and croplands, an area greater than the size of India. The declaration was backed by commitments from food companies, including palm oil giants, to deforestation-free sourcing policies of palm oil. Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts today joined 19 other major food companies to make zero-deforestation pledges. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg spoke to Al Gore at an investors event where executives from IKEA, Statoil and other multinationals announced their support for a price on carbon. Gore said the positive momentum coming from the corporate sector at the summit would have an “unstoppable” effect on markets. Goldenberg reports: The former US vice president and climate champion Al Gore has given his seal of approval to the climate summit – saying that it had helped advance the prospects for a global warming deal at the end of next year in Paris. “There is no question that a considerable amount of momentum was generated here,” Gore told The Guardian. “I think it was a tremendous boost to the whole movement that is towards the Paris agreement.” He said he had not been able to track the competing initiatives in real time, but he said he was pleased by the tone adopted by both the Chinese and American leaders. “Certainly,, there was nothing discouraging,” he said. However, Gore was more effusive about the initiatives from business leaders on the sidelines of the summit, with chief executives of international corporations pledging support for a new clean energy economy. “This is going to be unstoppable in markets,” he said, listing the expansion of renewable energy technologies. “The only question is how quickly it can be accelerated to overtake the destructive forces that are unleashed by these continuing absurdly high levels of emissions, but I am encouraged.” Julie Bishop, the foreign minister of Australia, says the country is on track to meet its plan to reduce its emissions 5% below 2000 levels by 2020. She touts the government’s much maligned “direct action” strategy for carbon reduction. Australia will announce a post-2020 emissions target next year. Representatives of countries whose leaders snubbed the summit are now speaking - this list includes major industrial economies and key carbon market players India, Russia, Canada, Australia, UAE and Germany. Here’s a handy (non-exaustive) summary of the pledges, initiatives and announcements made by countries from Mashable. Bjorn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre, writes in the China Daily today: “In a world where 4 million people die each year from burning firewood and dung in open fires inside homes because they do not have access to modern energy, while poverty, lack of clean water, infectious diseases, poor education and too little food afflict billions we cannot with a straight face claim that climate should be our top priority.” While this point may be controversial, he does allude to the results from a UN survey that shows the majority of people place the threat from climate change low on their list of priorities for action. Lomborg argues that this shows the difficulties facing leaders who want to take bold action on climate change. A number of partnerships and initiatives are being announced via the summit’s twitter feed. Here’s a quick wrap. Cities around the world commit to cut emission outputs by 454 mt annually by 2020 Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org and one of the figureheads of the march that took place in New York on Sunday, said Obama had failed to hit a home run in his speech today, preferring “a bunt single when we’re behind by 10 runs in the 9th inning”. “If the President really wants collective ambition, he’s got to show a little more can do spirit from the world’s leading economy. “Today’s boasts about his climate efforts ring hollow in the face of America passing Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world’ s largest oil and gas producer. We hope that when ‘next year’ comes and he proposes actual targets they’ll start to reverse the trend.” In his speech, Barack Obama referred to new initiatives to build climate resilience in developing countries. This will include: Improved and extended extreme weather risk outlooks to help avoid loss of life and property Data, tools and services to enable countries to better prepare for the impacts of climate change, including a new release of global elevation data A new public-private partnership to ensure that the climate data, tools, and products made available by U.S. technical agencies are useful to developing countries. Obama also announced a new executive order which will require federal agencies be guided by the need to build climate resilience into all international development programs and investments. This should skew US aid and development programs toward climate adaptation. Barack Obama’s full remarks are available on the White House website. Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid’s senior climate advisor said UK PM David Cameron’s acclamation of shale gas exploration as “lower carbon energy” in his speech today was misguided. “Cameron is absolutely right to link the battle against global poverty with tackling climate change. “But if the UK wants to be a climate leader it needs to look beyond shale gas for the truly sustainable solutions, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency which will secure a safe and healthy planet for everyone.” Jennifer Morgan, the director of climate and energy programs at the World Resources Institute says the Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli’s language was unprecedented. “China’s remarks at the Climate Summit go further than ever before. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli’s announcement to strive to peak emissions ‘as early as possible’ is a welcome signal for the cooperative action we need for the Paris Agreement. Peaking emissions is vital to curb climate change and to rein in dangerous air pollution. “China’s collaboration with other countries to advance low carbon development should inspire other countries as they outline their climate commitments in the coming months. China’s focus on South-South cooperation is particularly important in building trust. “The strong back-to-back statements by the two largest emitters send a clear signal that both countries will work seriously to put in place climate solutions domestically and reach an ambitious international agreement in Paris next year.” Meanwhile Raymond Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America responded positively to US president Barack Obama’s speech, with reservations. “President Obama’s speech today was encouraging and the Administration’s recent actions to curb emissions demonstrate leadership, but US policy on the whole does not reflect the urgency of the President’s rhetoric. “Our elected leaders should recognise that with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets this week to urge action on climate change - one of the largest mobilisations in recent history on any issue - the politics of the climate are changing.” The World Resources Institute live feed says the World Bank president Dr. Jim Yong Kim has called for a global carbon price saying that governments representing half the world’s population support such a measure. “We need a price on carbon and we should move quickly on establishing one.” Kim said 73 national governments and over 1,000 companies, which together represent 52 percent of global GDP, 54 percent of emissions, and almost 50 percent of world population, support a carbon price. Downing St has released a full transcript of David Cameron’s speech. A few lines of note: “Our agreement [in Paris] has to be legally binding, with proper rules and targets to hold each other to account.” “We must provide support to those who need it, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable.” “Now, if we get this right there need not be a trade-off between economic growth and reducing carbon emissions.” “That means fighting against the economically and environmentally perverse fossil fuel subsidies which distort free markets and rip off taxpayers.” “We are investing in all forms of lower carbon energy including shale gas and nuclear, with the first new nuclear plant coming on stream for a generation.” Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli said the country’s commitment to a fund that will transfer aid between developing countries would double (from what and by when I am not sure). “To promote self-cooperation on climate China will double annual financial support for establishment of a South-South cooperation fund on climate change, in which developing countries would help other developing countries. And provide $6 million to the UN Secretary General to promote South-South cooperation on climate change.” He said China would “announce post-2020 actions on climate change as soon as we can to markedly reduce carbon intensity, increase the share of non-fossil fuels, and raise the forest stock. We will also try to bring about the peaking of total CO2 emissions as soon as possible”. In the past years, he said China had made steps toward curbing its growing CO2 emissions. “In 2013, China’s carbon intensity was down 28.5 percent from the 2005 level. According to World Bank report, China contributed 58 percent of all the energy saved globally between 1991 and 2010. In 2013 the installed renewable capacity in China was 24 percent of world total and forest stock in China grew 2 billion cubic meters from 2005 levels.” He delivered a riposte to US president Barack Obama, who earlier called for a redrawing of the “old divisions” between developed and developing countries, saying the definitions of responsibility defined in the original climate convention should remain. Here is a video of Leonardo DiCaprio’s earlier speech to the summit. David Cameron and Barack Obama’s full speeches have been posted online (warning: frenetic typing in background). The US President Barack Obama has used his speech to the UN climate summit to turn up the heat on China. “Just a few minutes ago I met with Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli and reiterated my beliefs that, as the two largest economies and emitters in the world, we have a special responsibly to lead. That’s what big nations have to do.” Obama said that the rules of the climate game had changed since the days when nations like China were able to claim that responsibility for climate change mitigation lay on industrialised countries in North America and Europe. “Emerging economies are likely to produce more and more carbon emissions in years to come. So nobody can stand on the sidelines of this issue, we have to set aside the old divides,” he said. Obama said his government would announce new carbon reduction ambitions by next year and would meet its current commitment of a 17% cut by 2020. He compared climate change to the present litany of threats facing the world “terror, inequality, disease” and said that of all of these, climate change would be the defining issue of this century. “Climate is changing faster than our efforts to address it. The alarm bells keep ring our citizens keeping marching. We cannot pretend we don’t hear them, we must answer their call. “We cannot condemn our children and their children to a future that is beyond their capacity to repair. Not when we have the means... to begin repairing it right now. “But let me be honest, none of this is without controversy. In each of our countries there are interests that will be resistant to action. “But we have to lead, that is what the United Nations and this general Assembly is about.” UK prime minister David Cameron has urged leaders to strike a deal in Paris, while making no new announcements or commitments from his own country. “We must agree to a global deal in Paris next year, we simply cannot afford to put it off any longer.” He reprised some older rhetoric for which he has previously been ridiculed at home. “As prime minister, I pledged to lead the greenest government ever and I believe we have kept that promise.” He also obliquely references another of his more infamous phrases, when he promised to cut “green crap” from household energy bills, telling the plenary: “We need a framework based on green growth and not on green tape”. He said the UK was “playing its part” and was on track to cut its greenhouse emissions by 80% by 2050. A representative of oil and gas company Statoil says: “We all know that fossil fuels will provide a substantial part of future growth.” But that emissions need to be curbed and “the most forceful action would be an effective price on carbon”... “Government sets the rules, the industry competes for solutions.” He says the example of the coalition of six energy companies who today committed to methane emissions reduction formed today is an example of progress made at the summit. Third World Network, a leading voice of developing countries has added its voice to the cautious tone with which the global south is receiving the pledges being made to the Green Climate Fund. Suspicion abounds. “The question is whether the meeting will wind up as another talk fest. Many developed countries - especially the US and its allies - are delaying making their contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). “It was agreed in Cancun, Mexico in 2010 that developed countries will mobilise $100 billion dollars a year by 2020. The GCF has yet to receive any funds that can be disbursed to developing countries to undertake their climate actions. “Worse, there is a grave reluctance to indicate the size and scale of the resources that will be put into the GCF for its initial capitalisation. [Until France] only Germany has indicated that it is willing to contribute $1bn to the fund. Others have been deafeningly silent. “The summit must focus on this to get developed countries to announce their finance commitments to the Fund. If it does not, the UNFCCC meeting in Lima [in December] will be in jeopardy, as this is an existing obligation of developed countries that must be met latest by November.” Hello everyone, Karl Mathiesen here, I’ll be taking over from Adam Vaughan as the UK and US leaders and China’s deputy leader prepare to address the summit in New York. We are expecting Obama to begin speaking at 12:45pm in New York (5:45pm in the UK). Please follow me at @karlmathiesen for updates. So far we have seen: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon opened the session telling leaders from across the world: “We are not here to talk, we are here to make history” France joined Germany in pledging $1bn of climate aid over the next few years Actor Leonardo DiCaprio told leaders they had a choice: “You can make history or you will be vilified for it” Switzerland, South Korea and Denmark also pledged $270 million to the Green Climate Fund In Britain, Greenpeace protesters have taken over a freight train en route to a coal power plant A number of nations, including Ireland and Chile, have made commitments to significantly reduce carbon emissions and renewable energy. Development groups have questioned the reliability of the pledges to the Green Climate Fund, calling for France and others to show that they are not double counting old commitments. Denmark’s prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt joins other nations in pledging to the GCF: “Our words alone will not help. Denmark is working actively to increase climate finance.” She says Denmark will give US$70 million to Green Climate Fund on top of the US$250 million it has given since 2010. Denmark will be fossil free by 2050, she says. Switzerland’s president Doris Leuthard has pledged $100 million to the Green Climate Fund, joining Germany, France and South Korea as the only nations to commit a defined number to the fund for adaptation in developing countries. “Besides that we provide significant technological and capacity support [to developing countries].” The Netherlands meanwhile, have called for the EU carbon emissions reduction targets for 2050 to be 80%-95%. Philippines President Benigno Aquino III said this was the first major meeting of world leaders since his country was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. The time of debate for if climate change exists or not is over. Typhoon Haiyan hit my country in 2013 and by many accounts was the most powerful hurricane to ever make landfall. It is safe to say the Philippines is already feeling the impacts of climate change. We must all take action regardless of if our neighbors are acting. The Philippines is not waiting, by implementing a reforestation program and a renewable energy act in 2008. Oxfam has responded cautiously to the French pledge of $1bn. The developing world and its advocates have become increasingly frustrated by the lack of credibility in the rich world’s commitments to Green Climate Fund. “The devil is in the detail and there are too many uncertainties about the nature of the pledge to make a final call on its impact. French President Hollande has not clarified if the funds committed will be additional to existing climate and development commitments or double-counted. The fact that France has a tradition of mixing loans and grants in its climate finance commitments raises further questions about the exact nature and ambition of this pledge.” Here’s a video of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, the Marhsall Island poet who addressed the opening ceremony earlier. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, says that his country has delivered the $16bn in ‘climate aid’ that it promised over three years. “Japan keeps its promises,” he says. He also announces an “adaptation initiative to support developing countries” as climate change takes hold, but there are no further details beyond that headline. The new president of Iraq, Fuad Masum, with some understatement, says that Iraq, “for reasons with which you are all familiar, has had major problems” since international climate efforts began at the start of the 1990s. But he says Iraq is committed to tackling climate change. We know what a hot climate is in Iraq. We are well aware of its possible consequences on people the world over. We are aware of the threat of climate change and this is one of the major problems being tackled in our national strategy. Austrian president Heinz Fischer has called for a “universal, binding agreement” on climate change to come from the Paris conference in 2015. Suzanne Goldenberg in New York has interviewed Yvo de Boer, the former head of the UN climate secretariat that leads the international negotiations. She writes: “I really see it very much as taking the temperature of politics,” Yvo de Boer said. “Political leaders have not been engaged on climate since Copenhagn, and this I think will really be a litmus test to see whether politicians are willing to engage on this topic and whether they see Paris as a an opportunity to do something meaningful.” But he is not sure the gathering will do much to put the negotiations on a fast track to a deal at Paris next year. “One of the problems that I have with this summit is that it doesn’t really have a place in the political process towards Paris. This summit is not about getting clarity from leaders on what they feel are the key corner stones towards getting a Paris agreement...I think at the end of the summit we will not have a clear indication of what the three, four or five issues are.” De Boer said he would be watching to see whether the US lives up to its very strong language so far – with John Kerry pledging on Monday to put climate change ‘front and centre” of diplomacy. “If the US in the rhetoric takes a strong position I think that helps. The problem with the United States is that it often doesn’t go very far beyond the rhetoric. That is, the US is vocal and very demanding in international negotiations and then sips out the door when it is time to sign on the dotted line.” That was a dig about America’s failure to ratify the Kyoto climate treaty. In Britain, Greenpeace activists have staged their own great train robbery, flagging down and taking over a coal train en route to Cottam power station in Nottinghamshire. Greenpeace says: The activists used industry-standard emergency signals to flag down the 400-metre-long coal train as it was slowing down along rail sidings... The main coal supply route to the plant, which is run by French energy giant EDF, has now been cut off. Dozens of fully-trained Greenpeace activists have climbed onto the open coal wagons, and have started unloading the train’s climate-damaging cargo. “Unloading” apparently entails packing it into sacks labelled with “return to sender” tags addressed to Vladimir Putin. Greenpeace says 51% of the UK’s coal imports come from Russia and British energy companies paid £1 billion to oligarchs last year. Greenpeace climate campaigner Will McCallum, speaking from on top of one of the coal wagons, said: “Today we’re doing exactly what leaders in New York and here in the UK should be doing, which is to stand in the way of the massive damage to our health and climate inflicted by coal.” The activists say they will occupy the train for the duration of today’s climate summit in New York, where the UK’s prime minister David Cameron and energy secretary Ed Davey will speak later today. WRI has a good summary of statements from African countries. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni said: “Most unfortunately, this is not the fault of Africa. This is the fault of North America, Europe, and some parts of Asia.” “If we want to change the climate, we need to change the system,” climate news site RTCC reports Venezuela president, Nicolás Maduro, as saying. Has he been reading Naomi Klein’s new book? Probably not – Venezuela has taken a similar line at the climate talks for several years. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, takes a sideswipe at sanctions which he suggests are hampering his country’s ability to take action on global warming. “Nowadays it’s becoming difficult for some countries to access skills and know-how [on environmental solutions],” he says. But he stresses Iran will work constructively towards a Paris deal and talks about promoting energy efficiency, “improving quality of fuels despite sanctions”, and increasing the country’s share of renewable energy. Rouhani is congratulated at delivering his speech in exactly four minutes, the allotted time (almost everyone else is running over). He tweeted this a few minutes after he spoke: Ali Bongo Ondimba, the president of Gabon, says: We witness the effects of climate change every day with our own eyes. In 2009, when I attended my first climate summit in Copenhagen, I was filled with hope. We have an obligation to change the perilous course we have charted for humanity. Why today are we still so passive and so dispersed that we do not have a common strategy for the fight against climate change? Why can we not agree on a pragmatic strategy in the fight against climate change? We each have to shoulder our part of the responsibility if we are to build a common future. We [in Gabon] will continue to shoulder our burden of the responsibility. Chilean president Michelle Bachelet has says her country is particularly vulnerable to climate change. She says “the evidence is in the environmental sphere but it is also in the social sphere” and equity and justice should therefore motivate climate talks. She lists some of the initiatives undertaken by Chile: Committed to a 20% reduction of CO2 by 2020 Renewable sources already contribute 45% of electricity Has introduced a tax on CO2 emissions Plan to recover 100,000 hectares of degraded soil. With international supprort they could double that areas and regenerate 1 million hectares of native forest. Over in Manchester, the potential future leader of the UK during the Paris climate talks, Ed Miliband, says there’s no more important issue for my children’s generation than tackling global climate change Tommy Remengesau, president of Palau, a Pacific island state, says: We need action that will bring down the rapidly growing greenhouse gas emmissions in the atmosphere. We need to place a price on carbon. To scale up our efforts on mitigation. We were the first to feel the impacts of global warming but as New York as shown us, we will not be the last. Above all, we need to act. We’ve published the full transcript of DiCaprio’s speech now. You can read it in full here. Away from New York, Damian Carrington reports that the Labour party’s energy and climate change shadow, Caroline Flint, has told her party in Manchester that climate change is “too costly to ignore” and a Labour government in 2015 would lead efforts for a deal in Paris. I will end this week at home in Doncaster, where a fringe party is holding its conference. Yes, “live at Doncaster racecourse”, this weekend only, Nigel and the Climate Change Deniers. They don’t believe in climate change. They would halt renewable energy. And scrap all wind farms. Left to them, Britain would be a spent force, hiding from the future. Refusing to back Britain as a world leader in energy innovation to forge a cleaner economy. Sceptics like Farage need only look to China to see that low carbon is where the smart money is. It is Labour that will lead our nation, to a low carbon, clean energy Britain. Investing in renewables, carbon capture and storage for coal and gas, safe nuclear power and warmer, low energy homes. Our planet is too valuable. Climate change is too costly to ignore. Next year, in Paris, a Labour Government can lead the campaign for an agreement to protect our planet. Leadership by example at home, gaining influence abroad. Some NGOs are already complaining there’s more hot air than action at the climate summit. Brandon Wu, a senior policy analyst at development group ActionAid, says in a statement: Today, world and business leaders will take to the stage to make promise after promise on climate change. But we are going to see a series of voluntary commitments by some of the worst offenders, instead of real solutions to the climate crisis. After the weekend’s marches, the world was enthusiastic about dealing with climate change. But the summit was never set up to succeed. World leaders will be congratulating the private sector on a series of empty promises, instead of delivering a global agreement to tackle climate change that’s already having huge impacts for poor communities around the world. Here’s a round-up of soundbites from other leader addresses, courtesy of the UN’s official Twitter account: It’s worth noting that while there’s a lot of rhetoric flying around, and list-reading of what great stuff countries are doing, there’s very little in the way of new announcements so far. So far as I know, the French president’s promise of $1bn for the Green Climate Fund is a new pledge, but that needs checking. South Korea also promised $100m for the same fund. Suzanne Goldenberg, who’s at the summit, points out pretty much every leader is running over their allotted time. She also notes that Rousseff referenced Sunday’s huge worldwide marches (although the few hundred people at Rio’s march was dwarfed by what organisers say was more than 300,000 in New York). Just caught the end of Brazil’s Rousseff, who said that while she is committed to tackling climate change “we shall not give up the imperative task of reducing inequality” and “developing countries have an equal right to well-being”. South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, has been talking up her country’s climate efforts. South Korea is also home to the Green Climate Fund, the key organisation set up to transfer ‘climate aid’ from developed to developing countries to help them adapt to climate change. She says South Korea commits $100m to the fund. Here are some further excerpts from her address: Next year we will become the first Asian country to implement a nationwide emissions trading scheme. We will also let frugal consumers save electricity back to the grid We are doing our best to enlist everyone in reducing our carbon footrpint Tackling climate change needs to proceed on several fronts. First, we need to see climate action not as a burden but as an opportunity. How we view the climate agenda as boon or bane will bring huge differences. Investing in the chance to unlock new energy industries and jobs can ignite fresh engines of future growth. It has been said the stone age did not end because we ran out of stones. Second, technology and market-based solutions should be at the centre, innovations cannot come from governments alone. All countries are needed to be on board. For developing countries however, cutting CO2 can be a burden. To help them invest in capabilities... the developed world should transfer technology and know-how All countries must do their share if we are to limit global warming to 2C by the century’s end. She adds that early capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund is essential. She closes: “The human race has just one earth, we must save our planet from warming, the time to act is now.” The Peruvian president, Ollanta Humala, is up now. Peru is hosting the next major meeting of the UN climate negotiations, in Lima this December. Lima will make “great progress” towards a universal agreement on climate change, he says. New agreement must be just, must recognise historical responsibility, it must be well-balanced and allow for economic growth and the struggle against poverty. It must be transformative of energy sources... French president François Hollande has delivered his statement. Just as a reminder, France is hosting the crunch meeting in December 2015, which is the deadline for when countries have set for agreeing a climate pact. He said: Our commitment is to be clear, we need to do everything we can, so that we can curb and contain below 2C the increase in temperature. Every day we’re seeing an increase. We need to define a devleopment model for the next 30 years to enable access to goods for the people of the world and at the same time conserve the planet Each one of us must bear in mind the failure of Copenhagen, today we have an obligation to succeed. Such an agreement [in Paris] presupposes ineternational mobilisation to arrive at a legal framework that will be adapted to different levels of development. It is very important for us to win this battle and ensure an agreement can be reached French parliament is at this very moment discussing a law on energy transition that will set down law in 2015 that will reduce France’s emissions by 40% and has a goal of 30% renewable energy. I would like to emphasise the responsibilities of France. Not only are we hosting this conference, we need to make the gestures that are necessary on behalf of France, that is why the Green [Climate] Fund is a new prospect, France will provide $1bn over the next few years, as our contribution to the Green [Climate] Fund France is providing its full supprot to the alliance being formed around the secretary general At the Lima conference [the next UNFCCC meeting, at the end of this year], we want the basis for a future agreement to be set out, and in Paris we want to see these commitments [put into] into legal action. Paris is a symbolic city, a city of freedom, of human rights, and I hope that in December 2015, Paris can also be a symbol of change for climate. You can read Pachauri’s address in full now on the IPCC site. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a mother from the Marshall Islands, one of several Pacific island states at risk of rising sea levels, has just delivered a poem to her daughter for the close of the opening ceremony, saying she won’t “let her down” on action on climate change. She gets a standing ovation from the hall. The UN says there are more than 120 heads of state today who will now be making statements. Leonardo DiCaprio is up now. He was certainly the most powerful speaker so far: I am honoured to be here today. I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen, one of the 400,000 people who marched in New York on Sunday. As an actor I pretend for a living, I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems. I believe mankind has looked at climate change in the same way, as if pretending climate change wasn’t real, it would go away. But I think we know now that isn’t the case. [he lists physical changes taking place around the world, from ocean acidification to glaciers melting] None of this is rhetoric, none of this hysteria, this is fact. This body, perhaps more than any other gathering in human history, faces this difficult but achievable task. You can make history or you will be vilified for it. To make clear, this is not about telling people to change their light bulbs or buy a hybrid car. We must put a price tag on carbon and end fossil fuel subsidies. This is not a partisan debate, it is a human one. Solving this crisis is not a question of politics, it is a question of our own survival. This is the most urgent of times and the most urgent of messages. I pretend for a living but you do not. The people who heard their voices made on Sunday and the momentum will not stop, but now it is your turn. The World Resources Institute live blog managed to get down more of Pachauri’s address than I did. Here’s a snippet: “Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth’s surface than any other decade since 1850...our time to take action is running out ... “How on Earth can we leave our children with a world like this? We already have the means to build a better, more sustainable world ... “We are told the costs of limiting climate change are unaffordable - they are not. But wait until you get the bill for inaction.” Incidentally, Ban also said the UN’s own operations would be ‘climate neutral’ by 2020. Al Gore has just been talking. Here are some excerpts: [This weekend’s] Marches made clear we are entering a period of hope. ... ... Acting on climate change is not a choice between the economy and the environment. ... The path to change is clear. It leads to a global agreement next year in Paris. To those who have grown cynical about the process, I would remind you of the words of the great poet Wallace Stevens: after the final no, comes a yes. ... All we need is political will. But political will is a renwable resource. Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC, says he could not stand up at the summit and talk about climate change if solutions were not available. He says they are. Mayor Bill de Blasio just been talking about he’ll make sure New York follows through the climate efforts initiated by his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. “Only through a global movement can we act before it’s too late,” he says. Ban Ki-moon has addressed the summit, which he called “unprecedented and important.” I grew up poor in war-torn Korea. I dreamed of peace. I dreamed of prsoperity. I dreamed of opportunities. Sitting here today, in so many ways, is a dream come true. But today the dreams of people throughout the world hang in the balance. Climate change threatens the hard-won peace, opportunity, for billions of people. Today we must set the world on a new course. Climate change is a defining issue of our age, of our present. Our response will define our future. To ride this storm we need all hands on deck. That is why we are here today. We need a clear vision. The human, environmental and financial cost of climate change is fast becoming unbearable. We have never faced such a challenge, nor such an opportunity... There is only one thing in the way: us. That is why I have asked you to be here today. Thank you for your leadership. I’m asking you to lead. We must cut emissions. Science says they must peak by 2020 and decline sharply thereafter. By the end of this century we must be carbon neutral. No one is immune from climate change, not even this UN HQ, which were flooded during superstorm Sandy. We must invest in climate resilient societies that protect all, especially the most vulnerable. I ask all governments to commit to a meaningful climate agreement in Paris in 2015. We must work together to mobilise money and move markets. Let us invest in climate solutions available to us today. Economists have shown this comes at minimal extra cost while the benefits to our people and our planet are monumental. We need all public finance institutions to step up to the challenge. And we need to bring private finance from the sidelines. ... All around the world, people are acting. Two days ago, I was part of a massive people’s climate march in New York together with Mayor de Blasio. I was overwhelmed by the energy of the tens of thousands of people. In cities around the world, hundreds of thousands of people demanded climate action from their leaders. We are not here to talk, we are here to make history. The UN will be webcasting the opening ceremony and the rest of the summit, which is due to get underway any minute now. And here’s the running order of the rest of the day. Obama is talking around 5.45pm BST (12.45pm EST). Fiona Harvey says that Ed Davey, the UK energy secretary, will be talking around 6pm BST (1pm EST). David Cameron will speak after Obama. A group called The Elders, which includes former UN head Kofi Annan, former US president Jimmy Carter and former leaders of countries including Norway, Mexico, Brazil and more, has taken out this full page ad in the New York Times calling for action today. Adverts have been up in Times Square too: The adverts are promoting this “I’m for climate action” video which includes actors Edward Norton and Cate Blanchett, primatologist Jane Goodall, Ban himself, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, among many public figures: Suzanne Goldenberg highlights a handy guide to greenwashing during some of the announcements at today’s summit. She notes: As this is not a negotiating session – as UN officials have repeatedly said - most of the action is coming from private-public partnerships. Some of these are greener than others. Without wanting to sound like The Onion or The Daily Mash... Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, which is home to Oxford Street where nitrogen dioxide levels are the highest in the world and in breach of EU safety limits, has won an award for clean air. Johnson’s environment adviser and former journalist Matthew Pencharz collected awards in New York on Monday night for air quality and carbon measurement from the C40, a group of cities committed to cutting carbon emissions. It’s a bit of a PR coup for Johnson, who has been on a concerted push to burnish his efforts on cutting air pollution in the capital. Talks or not talks, climate change is busily reshaping the world. As we reported last week, and was confirmed by official data on Monday, sea ice in the Arctic this year was at its sixth lowest extent ever. That doesn’t sound so bad until you consider it was was still over a million square kilometres less than the longterm average. The Arctic sea ice minimum was 5.02m square kilometres this year, up from the record low of 3.5m in 2012, but well below the long-term average of 6.3m. By hosting this summit, Ban has succeeded in putting a Paris climate agreement at the top of leaders’ agendas, EU climate change commissioner Connie Hedegaard tells Reuters. “With all the outreach we need to do in this area, it is crucial that all the foreign ministries are taking this up,” she said. She said the fact that foreign ministers, including Kerry and France’s Laurent Fabius, discussed climate deal negotiations on Sunday in a meeting of the world’s 17 biggest emitting countries was a sign that the issue had become a policy priority. But Hedegaard and Fabius highlighted what could be a roadblock to a Paris pact - agreement on the legal basis of the final deal. US negotiators have acknowledged that a deeply polarised Congress is unlikely to ratify a legally binding UN treaty. “We have to have a legal agreement, otherwise it will be just words,” Fabius said on Monday. Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, will be addressing the climate summit. In a briefing note, the Brazilian government notes that it’s not bound to cut emissions under international agreements, but is doing so anyway. Even though Brazil does not have any quantified obligation to reduce emissions under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol – since it has no significant historical responsibility for the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere – it has been helping mitigate climate change according to the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”. To that end, the country has put public policies in place and sought to implement new solutions that combine socio-economic development with measures that are climate-friendly. The focus for carbon cuts in Brazil is on stopping deforestation (which has recently started going the wrong way in the Amazon), investment in hydro power and reducing emissions from the country’s rapidly-growing agriculture. It’s true that Brazil isn’t a big emitter historically, but it’s in the top tier of emitters now, as our carbon map shows: The Empire State Building was lit up green last night to mark the climate summit: We’re due some celebrity wattage at 1pm BST (8am EST), as actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Chinese actor Li Bingbing will be joining the UN dignatories at the opening ceremony. DiCaprio calls it a “key moment” for climate change efforts: New York mayor Bill de Blasio, head of the UN climate science panel Rajendra Pachauri and former US vice-president Al Gore are also due at the summit opening. China, the world’s biggest emitter of carbon emissions (and soon historical emissions too, see our carbon map) is giving a press conference at 7pm BST (2pm EST). Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of China’s NDRC, will be talking to reporters, as the Chinese president Xi Jinping is not attending (Narendra Modi, India’s new prime minister, is another notable no-show). There has been speculation that China will talk about its huge emissions peaking. Earlier this summer a key adviser to the Chinese government suggested that China is on the verge of announcing limits on its emissions for the first time. Suzanne Goldenberg writes from New York on Sunday’s march and what to expect from Obama today: There is strong anticipation that at least some of the leaders will talk about Sunday’s climate march – which drew historic crowds in New York City. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said that he was overwhelmed by the turnout. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, who also marched, spoke of a turning point. “I think that it showed people are now much more aware in all our countries of how important this topic is,” he told reporters after the march. By Monday night, there was even speculation from activists that David Cameron would mention the march in London. Meanwhile, White House officials previewing Barack Obama’s speech said he would announce measures that would provide new technologies and other support to help poor countries cope with climate change. He will also unveil a new executive order requiring government agencies factor climate resilience into international aid programmes. “Going forward, the US. will continue to help develop, launch, and implement practical, action-oriented international initiatives such as those announced at today’s UN climate summit,” a White House statement said. Heads of state including Barack Obama, David Cameron and Dilma Rousseff are gathering at the UN in New York today in a bid to inject momentum into slow-burning international negotiations on climate change. It’s the first time world leaders have come together to discuss the issue in five years, when Obama, Angela Merkel of Germany, Manmohan Singh for India, the UK’s Gordon Brown and others attempted to thrash out a binding climate deal in Copenhagen. Back then, they failed to get a binding agreement though many countries did make voluntary pledges to cut carbon emissions by 2020. Nearly 200 countries have subsequently pledged to reach agreement in Paris at the end of 2015 on a climate pact for carbon cuts beyond 2020. Ban’s meeting today isn’t part of those official climate talks (run by the UNFCCC) but is meant as a chance for governments, cities and business to show some ambition on tackling climate change. Ban says the summit has two goals: to mobilise political will for a universal and meaningful climate agreement next year in Paris; and second to generate ambitious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience The summit comes just two days after marches around the world, from Melbourne to Manhattan, calling for leaders today to make bold commitments on climate change. Organisers claimed the marches drew over 0.5m people worldwide. Our correspondents Suzanne Goldenberg and Fiona Harvey are at the summit and we’ll be providing live coverage here throughout the day. The opening ceremony is at 1pm BST (8am EST)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/01/fukushima-effect-japan-schools-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-01T17:48:23Z","webTitle":"Fukushima effect: Japan schools take health precautions in radiation zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/01/fukushima-effect-japan-schools-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/01/fukushima-effect-japan-schools-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima effect: Japan schools take health precautions in radiation zone","bodyText":"At first sight, there seems little out of the ordinary on this wet afternoon for the pupils of Oyama primary school. They wave from classroom windows as they rush to finish the day's cleaning chores. Outside, the wind and rain sends the school's pet rabbits into a retreat deep inside their hutches. But buried beneath the surface of the school playing field is evidence that life in this village, about 40 miles from the Fukushima No 1 nuclear power plant, is far from normal: a large quantity of radioactive soil, wrapped in tarpaulin. Health concerns for the school's 225 pupils, aged six to 12, centre on the radioactive isotopes released by the plant, whose operator has been criticised for failing to prepare for the 11 March tsunami. In a preliminary report released on Wednesday, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) had underestimated the risk of the tsunami, although they praised the plant workers' post-disaster response. \"The tsunami hazard for several sites was underestimated,\" the report said. \"Nuclear plant designers and operators should appropriately evaluate and provide protection against the risks of all natural hazards.\" The inspectors urged authorities to closely monitor the health of plant workers and members of the public, including thousands of children. In April, Japan's government caused anger when it raised the upper limit of safe radiation exposure for children from 1 millisievert a year to 20mSv a year, the same level the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends for nuclear plant workers. The decision prompted Toshiso Kosako, a Tokyo university professor, to tearfully announce his resignation as a government nuclear adviser, describing the revised upper limit as \"intolerable\". Ignoring official assurances that the exposure limit and current radiation readings in the area posed no threat to children's health, parents and teachers in Otama and five other communities in Fukushima prefecture started removing and burying topsoil from school playgrounds. At schools where mechanical diggers were hard to come by, parents shovelled the soil themselves. The cleanup drew a dismissive response from Yukio Edano, the government's chief spokesman. \"Based on guidelines by the education and science ministries, there is no need for [soil] removal,\" he said. But Oyama's principal, Hiroyuki Ando, said parental pressure, and the fear of the possible effects of long-term exposure to contaminants in the soil, had left him with no choice. \"We were worried about high radiation levels, particularly caesium in topsoil, so we consulted scientists and the local education authorities and removed the soil ourselves,\" he said. The steps produced immediate results: radiation readings in topsoil outside Ando's school dropped from 1.32 microsieverts to 0.25 microsieverts an hour, compared with a pre-disaster reading of 0.04 microsieverts. Under government rules, children should not play outdoors for more than an hour a day if radiation levels exceed 3.8 microsieverts an hour. \"Even though the readings are better, they're still much higher than they were before the accident. I don't think we'll ever be able to get back to those days,\" said Ando, adding that pupils would have to take swimming lessons at a nearby sports centre this summer due to concern about possible contamination of the school's outdoor pool. The education ministry conducted a partial volte face, announcing last week it would aim to reduce the exposure limit for children at school to the previous 1 mSv a year. Officials promised to foot the bill for the removal of topsoil from outdoor play areas in the region where levels exceed the limit. \"We have taken the measure so children and their parents can feel relieved,\" the education minister, Yoshiaki Takaki, told reporters. Many residents of Otama, where the school is located, feel anything but relieved. The Fukushima effect is being felt throughout this picturesque village of 8,600, where the rice – farmers have all but given up hope that nervous consumers will buy this year's crop – is considered among the best in Japan. \"We are not in the least bit reassured by what the government tells us,\" said Yuki Watabe, as she and her son arrived at the supermarket wearing surgical masks. \"I wear this when I go out, and wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly. I don't hang the laundry outside to dry and the children have to play indoors for the time being.\" Others accuse their neighbours of over-reacting. \"I don't think it was necessary to remove the soil,\" said Miwa Takeda, as she waited outside the school for her nine-year-old daughter. \"Radiation levels haven't exceeded the daily limit, so why bother? My husband worked at the Fukushima No 2 plant until the day after the tsunami and he hasn't bothered undergoing a radiation check. We eat the local vegetables and our kids play outside for as long as they like.\" Ando says data showing that radiation levels are safe has done little to counter public unease about the future. \"Most of the parents here were adamant that we did this, even though the government keeps saying there is no risk. \"You don't know what effects radiation will have 10 or 20 years down the line. It's not just about safety, but about reassuring people.\" Schools throughout Fukushima prefecture are stepping up their response to the accident in the absence, they say, of satisfactory information from Tepco and the government. On Wednesday, when most Japanese children changed into light summer uniforms, schools in Fukushima asked pupils to stay wrapped up in their winter clothes to reduce their exposure to atmospheric radiation. Dosimeters to monitor radiation in pupils have been distributed to teachers at more than 1,600 kindergartens and schools in the prefecture. One school in Koriyama city, 37 miles from the nuclear plant, publishes regular radiation updates on its website, which receives 4,000 hits a day. As they count the cost of the disaster in anxiety and possible damage to the local economy, Fukushima's infamy weighs heavy on the people whose home has become synonymous with radiation. \"To be mentioned in the same breath as Chernobyl is a source of great pain for us,\" Ando said. \"It is all very well the government telling us that we're over-reacting, but this is where we live. This is where our children go to school.\" • This article was amended on 2 June 2011. The original spelled a village as Oyama.

The closure is a consequence of the Fukushima incident in Japan in March, which has closed down much of the nuclear industry there and led to a rethink of nuclear power around the world. But the government said the move had \"no implications\" for the UK's plans for new nuclear reactors. Workers at the plant were told on Wednesday morning that there was \"considerable scope\" for them to be re-employed in other parts of the Sellafield complex. It will take several months for the plant to close fully. The west Cumbrian mixed-oxide fuel plant has cost the taxpayer £1.4bn since it was commissioned in the early 1990s. The plant, operated by the government-owned Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), was set up to create mixed-oxide fuel for use in nuclear power plants, with its chief customers the Japanese nuclear industry, including the Fukushima complex. The plant was built in 1996 and became operational in 2001. The NDA denied there were any repercussions for the troubled Thorp reprocessing plant, although Thorp is also involved in generating Mox fuel, which is made from plutonium and uranium. Tony Fountain, chief executive of the NDA, told workers on Wednesday morning: \"The reason for this [closure] is directly related to the tragic events in Japan following the tsunami and its ongoing impact on the power markets. As a consequence we no longer have a customer for this facility, or funding.\" He admitted that the plant had suffered \"many years of disappointing performance\" that has been funded by the taxpayer. He said the key to attempts to save the plant in recent years had been the commitment of Japanese utilities to reusing nuclear fuel, and their support for the UK as a \"centre of excellence\". But with the crisis in the Japanese nuclear industry, that route is no longer viable. Fountain said: \"The Hamaoka plant, owned by Chubu, the intended recipient of the first fuel, is currently closed awaiting extensive reinforcement work. Following Chubu, Tepco [Tokyo Electric Power Company] were destined to take 50% of the plant output and they as owner of the Fukushima plants are clearly facing the most extreme challenges.\" Speculation about the future of the plant has been rife for months, as it became clear that the Japanese nuclear industry was unlikely to recover after Fukushima. The NDA said: \"[We have] concluded that in order to ensure that the UK taxpayer does not carry a future financial burden from [Sellafield Mox plant] that the only reasonable course of action is to close [the plant] at the earliest practical opportunity.\" The NDA said it would continue to store Japanese plutonium safely, and \"further develop discussions with the Japanese customers on a responsible approach to support the Japanese utilities' policy for the reuse of their material\". The government insisted that the closure of the Sellafield Mox plant had \"no implications\" for the proposed construction of several new nuclear power stations in the UK. Any such new nuclear power plants would be unlikely to be of the kind that could use Mox as a fuel, because the enormous costs involved in such reprocessing make it uneconomic to do so. However, the government in a recent consultation held open the proposal that a new plant using Mox as fuel could be built, even though industry experts say the possibility of a company wishing to build such a plant are remote. Another question is whether the closure will prompt NDA to close the troubled Thorp reprocessing plant as well. The NDA denied that it was considering closing Thorp, and said the two cases were \"unrelated\" and that the business case for Thorp, which produces plutonium from other nuclear waste, contined to be strong. However, the Thorp plant was constructed on the same premise as the Sellafield Mox plant - that there would be a market for reprocessed fuels to be used in nuclear reactors. That market has proved extremely small - Japan has been the only customer - and the demise of the Japanese nuclear industry has closed down the market altogether. New nuclear plants, such as the fleet of new reactors the government is hoping that European power utilities such as France's EDF and Germany's RWE will want to build in this country, will not use Mox or plutonium. The government's suggestion that another reactor could be built in the UK that would use Mox as fuel was greeted with extreme scepticism by nuclear industry experts. They said any replacement Mox processing plant would be \"another white elephant\" that would cost the UK taxpayer billions but have little or no market for its products. Industry experts noted, however, that the government has an interest in continuing to insist that Mox is still viable. If ministers admitted that Mox was not viable, the government would be forced to acknowledge that the hundreds of millions of pounds worth of plutonium that are stored here would have to be recognised as a liability on government balance sheets. However the pretence that another Mox plant may be built allows the plutonium to be reckoned a zero-value asset. Labour MP Jamie Reed, whose Copeland constituency includes Sellafield, called on the government to lay out details of a potential plan to build a new Mox plant at the site. He said: \"It is now absolutely essential that the new Mox plant is brought forward as quickly as possible. The market for Mox fuel exists and is growing, our plutonium disposition strategy relies upon such a facility and the industry requires it.\" He warned that \"gleeful vultures\" would seize upon the decision to close the plant and argue against the \"critical national need for new Mox plant\". Green groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said the move showed nuclear power did not make economic sense. Friends of the Earth's policy and campaigns director, Craig Bennett, said: \"Yet again taxpayers are footing the bill for the Alice in Wonderland economics of the nuclear industry. This money could have been spent developing the UK's vast renewable energy potential, creating new green jobs and business opportunities. This announcement will be a tremendous blow to the hundreds of people that work at the plant - we hope their expertise can be redeployed to help safeguard us all from the nuclear industry's existing legacy of radioactive waste.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/26/obesity-smoking-more-dangerous-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T16:55:06Z","webTitle":"Look at the science – smoking and obesity are more harmful than radiation | Geraldine Thomas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/26/obesity-smoking-more-dangerous-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/26/obesity-smoking-more-dangerous-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Look at the science – smoking and obesity are more harmful than radiation","bodyText":"The recent frenzy following the events in Japan suggests that the media are keen to feed our nuclear fears, by focusing on exposure to radiation that is extremely unlikely to result in a single death, compared with a natural catastrophe that has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced more than 100,000. We are a successful species inhabiting a radioactive world and must have evolved protective mechanisms to deal with the effects of natural radiation. Let's inject some science into the nuclear debate to find out just how dangerous exposure to radiation might be, and apply it to our daily lives. What can our experience of the atomic bombs and Chernobyl tell us about the health effects of radiation exposure? Radiation can be divided into two main types – highly penetrating such as X and gamma ray, and isotopic such as iodine-131, which needs to enter the body to have an effect. The radiation exposure in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a short-lived, intense, exposure to relatively high doses of penetrating radiation. Following the Chernobyl accident, the radiation was prolonged and mainly isotopic. Exposure was therefore via ingestion and inhalation of radiostopes, mainly iodine-131 and caesium-137. The majority of those who died following the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died from flash burns or other injuries; 15-20% died as a result of acute radiation sickness. Long-term studies between 1950 and 1997 show that, of the 9,335 cancer deaths in the 86,572 population, only 440 (5%) of the solid cancers and 103 of 310 leukaemias were attributed to radiation exposure. A very small proportion (0.8%) of non-cancer related deaths were also associated with radiation. In addition, there are no inherited effects observed in the subsequent generation. The decrease in average life expectancy is 2.6 years and 21 days respectively for those who received the highest and lowest doses. Since the majority of the population received low doses, the average loss of life expectancy is four months. The argument can be made that the full consequences will only be known when the last of the exposed generation have reached old age, but we can already ask the question, \"does radiation exposure at this level, cause as many health problems as we thought?\" I do not think so. The only proven radiobiological effect has been an increase in thyroid cancer in those who were young at the time of the accident. The increase was rapid, and is still apparent today, although the level of thyroid cancer is back to what it was prior to the accident for those who were born from 1987 onwards – when the radioactive iodine disappeared from the environment. There appears to be little difference in the type or clinical outcome of radiation-induced thyroid cancer when compared with age-matched controls. Thyroid cancer is very amenable to treatment and although 30% of patients may suffer a relapse, only 1% may eventually die of their disease. Of 6,000 diagnosed cases since 1986, only 15 have so far proved fatal. Many of these cases would have been prevented if potassium iodide had been provided at the appropriate time. There is still no evidence for increases in other diseases in the exposed population at large And in the exclusion zone around the reactor (now a thriving natural environment), the presence of higher-than-background levels of caesium-137 suggests it poses little risk to human or animal health. Life-span studies, similar to those carried out in Japan, would be needed in order to identify any further minor health effects. So what have we learnt from Chernobyl? Cancer risk is determined by the age at exposure and concentration of radioisotopes in particular tissues. Low dose exposure to caesium-137, even over a long period of time, is perhaps not as damaging to health as we would have predicted. The one thing we appear not to have learnt is how to deliver information about radiation risk to an exposed population. There have been considerable psychological consequences, unrelated to the actual radiation risks for human health, from the Chernobyl accident, which have been poorly researched. Radiation risk must be put into context. The consequences for the most exposed group of atomic bomb survivors was an average loss of life expectancy significantly lower than that caused by severe obesity or smoking. A rational debate about nuclear power means putting the risks and benefits into perspective. Unfortunately it seems that when radiation knocks at the door, science and rational thinking go out of the window. • Prof Geraldine Thomas holds a chair in molecular pathology at Imperial College London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/01/nuclear-government-complex-coalition-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-01T18:59:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: The nuclear-government complex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/01/nuclear-government-complex-coalition-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/01/nuclear-government-complex-coalition-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear-government complex","bodyText":"Our party stood at the general election on a manifesto promise to oppose plans to build a new generation of nuclear power plants because it is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy. Our party also rejects nuclear subsidies – there is no justification for paying extra to support nuclear, which is a mature technology, when we could use the money to invest in innovation to bring down the cost of new renewable technologies. We managed to win a commitment to this in the coalition agreement, which states that there will be no public subsidy for nuclear power and allows Liberal Democrats to maintain their opposition to nuclear power. We were proud that our party democratically decided at our conference in September 2010 to \"ensure that any changes to the carbon price do not result in windfall benefits to the operators of existing nuclear power stations\". We are therefore dismayed that the finance bill will result in a windfall of £50m per year from 2013 to 2030 to existing nuclear operators for doing nothing different – pushing up consumer electricity bills. Support for a Conservative party-inspired policy on nuclear power must not become another tuition fee debacle for our party. We need to make a stand and ensure that the nuclear industry does not benefit from being an unintended beneficiary of tackling carbon emissions. Cllr Louise Bloom, David Boyle, Gareth Epps and John Leech MP • The orchestrated effort of coalition officials and the nuclear industry to create a pro-nuclear public information campaign immediately after Fukushima shows that not even a large-scale nuclear incident can halt this government's ideological obsession with new nuclear (UK bid to play down Japan crisis revealed, 1 July). In particular, the leadership of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in this effort points to an alarming propensity to prioritise business interests over public safety. Officials clearly did not care to wait for the results of the government's safety review, due in September, before rushing to assure us that a similar disaster was not possible on these shores. Fukushima was a terrible reminder of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a nuclear incident and, as BIS officials predicted, public support for nuclear has nosedived. But while governments such as those in Germany and Switzerland have listened to the people and chosen to phase out nuclear altogether, our government is doing all it can to rig the energy market in favour of nuclear power. In parliamentary questions put down today, I am asking the government to shed greater light on the meetings in the days following Fukushima, asking what briefings were given to the government's chief scientist and just how many staff they had working on what was effectively a PR exercise for the nuclear industry. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • While sadly not surprising, it is disgraceful that government is working hand in glove with the nuclear industry to massage public opinion. Next week ministers are likely to reject proposals in parliament to claw back over £1bn of windfall profits that nuclear power companies will gain from the inept introduction of new carbon taxes. So, as people struggle with rising fuel bills, and government schemes to insulate homes are cut because of the spending squeeze, we are handing cash to six huge electricity companies. The Treasury's failure to block this can only be explained by the favouritism towards nuclear power that your story exposes. Martyn Williams Friends of the Earth • Chris Huhne should hang his head in shame for his involvement in this deplorable piece of media management. The same day it is reported that urine samples from children 60km from Fukushima contain traces of dangerous radioactive materials (Report, 1 July). In an effort to gain some credibility, Mr Huhne should visit Fukushima and see the impact of this terrible incident on local communities. To fool the UK public about Fukushima is bad enough; to threaten the waste of billions of pounds on the folly of new nuclear build is quite scandalous. George Regan Chair, Nuclear Free Local Authorities • On Thursday the German parliament voted by a stunning 513 to 79 to phase out all nuclear power by 2022. Events since March prove that Germany has drawn lessons that Britain refuses to consider. Despite industry assurances in March that there was nothing to worry about, the industry now acknowledges that the Fukushima disaster is as serious as Chernobyl. In both cases, hundreds of thousands of residents living near the plants have been affected either by radiation exposure or forcible (and permanent) relocation – or both. In both cases, the clean-up costs are an eye-watering $100bn-plus. We're told that the new generation of nuclear reactors will be cheap and safe – yet the new Finnish reactor is several years behind schedule and is already double its planned construction costs. How do we trust the government on its pronouncements on nuclear's costs and safety when it is so clearly the mouthpiece of the industry? Ministers assure us that nuclear will not be subsidised – but who is paying forthe £83bn decommissioning costs for existing nuclear plants (actually, it's the taxpayer) and who pays out when there's a major disaster? Look no further than Japan, where Fukushima's operator now benefits from government guarantees because the failure of the company is too serious to contemplate. Why tempt fate when nuclear is such a high-risk, high-cost choice? John Rigby Berlin, Germany • The Committee on Climate Change's report that the UK is in danger of missing our carbon reduction targets is yet another wake-up call for ministers. The report shows the government is simply not doing enough to meet the challenge of climate change – urgent action is needed. I welcome the CCC's call for the government's green deal scheme to have clear targets for reducing carbon emissions. The green deal could mean lower fuel bills and reduced carbon emissions. But this won't happen without a clear level of ambition and a plan for achieving it. Labour's warm homes amendment, which links the scheme to the UK's emission reduction targets, will do this. Since Labour first proposed the warm homes amendment back in January, support for it has grown. A coalition of over 70 organisations, including NGOs, trade unions, businesses and trade associations, is now backing the plans. Government ministers who have consistently rejected this approach should think again. Luciana Berger MP Shadow minister for energy and climate change • David King argues for the prime minister to take a more prominent global role in encouraging action on climate change (Needed: a world leader, 29 June). The problem for David Cameron is that the EU's approach to climate policy is misguided and sets a poor example. While Europe rightly has challenging targets to cut emissions and pushes hard for other countries to do the same, in order for it to set a compelling example to other countries, going green has to be done cost-effectively. If the EU is unable to demonstrate that carbon reduction policies are economically attractive then other nations – especially developing countries such as China and India – are unlikely to follow. One major EU policy in particular demonstrates how costly decarbonisation can be made to be: the EU2020 renewable energy target, which requires 20% of Europe's energy use to come from renewable sources. Professor King himself is reported to have said in 2008, soon after the target was agreed, that the EU heads of state did not appear to understand the cost implications of what they were agreeing to. He even wondered whether the over-aggressive renewable target was a mistake. A recent Policy Exchange report shows that the UK could hit its carbon targets without the unnecessary renewable target, and do so much more cheaply through a cost-effective mix of coal to gas switching, energy efficiency, nuclear and a range of renewable and non-renewable low-carbon generation options. The target costs the UK alone an estimated £66bn. Renewables have an important part to play in the global energy mix, but by setting unnecessary targets, Europe is making decarbonisation harder, and more expensive, than it needs to be. Dr Simon Less Head of environment and energy, Policy Exchange • Sir David King justifiably claims credit for his role in focusing political attention on the threat of climate change, and congratulates the coalition government on an array of domestic polices to promote a low-carbon economy. Sir David apparently sees developments such as electricity market reform and a carbon floor price as unmitigated progress; but this view is unlikely to be shared by the 4 million households in England who currently cannot afford to maintain a warm and healthy living environment, and who will face higher bills as a result. Environmental campaigners must realise that much of the progress on their agenda is often secured at the expense of higher energy costs for consumers, including millions of vulnerable and low-income households, yet there can be limited recognition of this problem and of the need for suitably ambitious remedial policies. Your business pages also report that further energy price increases are inevitable (Centrica hints at gas price rise, 29 June); equally inevitable will be further increases in the number of fuel-poor households. Environmental and social objectives need not be contradictory and, in fact, they combine perfectly in the form of improvements to domestic heating and insulation standards. Perhaps Sir David could use his impressive powers of persuasion to convince the government of the need for an adequately funded energy efficiency strategy to make energy costs affordable for all UK households.

With that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday for all the latest developments. And since it's a Friday evening, the ever entertaining UKIP: Over in Greece senior government officials have been laying down the line on EU demands that the country enact new austerity measures as news comes in that the Greek prime minister will be holding talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin next week. Helena Smith writes: International pressure on Greece to implement yet more austerity to plug a prospective budget black hole t is fuelling passions in Athens. With the German government announcing that the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will meet for a \"working lunch” with Angela Merkel in Berlin next Friday, senior officials are saying he will use the opportunity to press home the point that further across the board cuts are simply “out of the question.” “There would be a revolution. People can take no more and the troika [mission chiefs] have to stop being technocrats, open their eyes and realize that the government would collapse if called upon to pass more measures,” said one well-placed aide. “We’d be back at square one again with creditors having to face [Alexis] Tsipras,” he said of the vehemently anti-austerity radical left main opposition Syriza leader. Overnight, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras, in an unusual departure from the diplomatic language he usually resorts to, described the prospect of more measures as “dangerous.” “No austerity measures are needed. They are dangerous; we should let the automatic stabilizers work. We are willing to take structural measures with a fiscal impact, but not austerity measures,” he told CNBC in an interview following the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. Reiterating that Athens had already achieved the biggest fiscal consolidation ever recorded in western history, he added: “Greece has achieved tremendous progress up to now, people have made huge sacrifices; so we have to be very careful now what kind of measures we implement to close the fiscal gap, if any,” he said. With the average Greek having suffered a 40% loss in disposable income and debt-stricken country laboring under record levels of unemployment (at nearly 28 % the highest in the euro zone) the deputy Greek prime minister Evangelos Venizelos also lashed out this afternoon at the prospect of more measures. “Our priority is investments, corrective changes, privatisations and the gradual replacement of injustices and sacrifices,” he told reporters. “There are limits that are not being put forward by the Greek government but common sense.” The Greek finance minister will meet Troika missions heads on Sunday to discuss plugging the fiscal gap with aides saying the Greek side had a “one million euro plus package” of structural reforms to cover the budget black hole. And here's the statement from the Ecofin meeting. Once more with the US, wholesale inventories rose 0.4% in September, with August growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.8%. And for anyone wondering what is happening at the Ecofin meeting: Some good news for Ireland, with Deutsche Bank creating 700 new jobs in the country's financial sector. Henry McDonald in Dublin says: The German bank is seeking to create a regional hub and centre of excellence in Dublin's Eastpoint Business Park. It has been operating in Ireland since 1991 and already employs 300 workers. The Global Head of Financial Institutions at Deutsche, Neilus De Groot said the high standard of Ireland’s graduates was a dominating factor in its decision. Most of the new workers will be hired in the next two years, he said. The expansion in Deutsche's Irish operation is being backed by the Republic's Industrial Development Authority. Ireland's Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said that it was a huge vote of confidence in the country's international financial services sector and in the Irish economy. \"International financial services is a key sector targeted as part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. \"This is a sustainable, export-driven industry where Ireland has developed major strengths and we have put in place important changes to target substantial jobs growth in the coming years,\" he added. Deutsche Bank's expansion comes in the same week that Enda Kenny revealed he is in discussions with Chancellor Angela Merkel to access funds for Irish small businesses from the German state KFW development bank. Back in the US, industrial production fell unexpectedly in October. It slipped 0.1% month on month after a 0.7% rise in September, as output at power plants and mines declined. Rob Carnell of ING Bank said the figures would have little effect on the timing of the Federal Reserve easing off on its bond buying programme: [This is] hardly the sort of figure that will send the Federal Reserve scrabbling to start the taper. But the headline appears worse than the underlying picture. Indeed, manufacturing production delivered a reasonable 0.3% month on month increase, and most of the softness was concentrated in utilities and mining, in particular natural gas extraction, where on-going price softness seems to have weighed on extraction activity, and production has been feeble for some months. Together with a limp report from the Empire Manufacturing survey for November, delivered before the production data, the tone of newsflow since Janet Yellen’s Senate testimony, where she spelled out that taper required a notable improvement in the economy – has been mediocre. Risk markets won’t be too upset by this. Sterling has moved higher against the dollar and euro after Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said it could not ignore inflation expectations, and may have to raise rates before all spare capacity in the economy is used up. Upbeat UK economic data this week and comments from Bank governor Mark Carney have raised the prospects of interest rates rising more quickly than previously expected. Weale's comments seem to be adding to that idea. He said: We cannot risk a situation where people say we are deliberately looking the other way if the data show a significant change in inflation expectations. Earlier, in a speech in London, European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said it would not be easy to turn off the money taps, even as he repeated suggestions it could buy assets from banks if needed.He said: Obviously it will not be an easy matter to get out of the low rates of our policies. We are not there yet...there are more questions that have to be addressed before we address this question. But that does not mean we are not considering (it) and we don't have it at the back of our mind. ECB member Peter Praet became the first of its policymakers to talk about asset buying, and today Mersch said it was an option, but there were difficulties: In our mandate it says we can do asset purchases...but Europe is a little bit different in so far that we do not have a single sovereign signature. Quotes courtesy Reuters. Mixed signals from the US, where the New York state manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank although business confidence was relatively stable. The Federal Reserve's Empire manufacturing index fell to -2.21 from 1.52 in October (anything below zero indicating a contraction). But the index of business conditions was 37.51, edging down from 40.76. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is much weaker than expected and it marks the lowest print since the start of the year. The breakdown of the report shows a marked deterioration in all the main components, a sign that activity has registered some slowdown over the month despite less pressure on the fiscal side. All in all, the picture described by today's report is not encouraging as it looks like the effects of the fiscal debate and government shutdown have not waned yet. ... in the next few months says Cypriot minister of finance Harris Georgiades in an interview with Reuters. Says restrictions are already looser than in March, when the independent southern section of the island was forced to close two banks and slap controls on money transfers to prevent economic collapse. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. More from the EU, this time its disease monitoring agency. In a sobering report, it says there are several categories of bacteria that cannot be killed with with carbapenems, the most powerful class of antibiotic drugs. Reuters reports the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control saying the proportion of infections resistant to carbapenems has increased sharply in the last four years - particularly in southern Europe - and almost all European countries now have reported cases. The most severe cases involve bloodstream infections, but drug-resistant bugs can also more frequently cause serious problems in the respiratory and urinary tracts. Reuters said: \"The ECDC data showed that the proportion of bloodstream infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common cause of illness in hospital patients, that were resistant to carbapenems was above 5 percent in 2012 in five countries - Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. \"In recent years, there has been a rush for the exit by the drugs industry as its researchers have struggled to find leads for novel antimicrobial drugs. Companies have turned instead to more profitable lines of drug research, including treatments for cancer and chronic diseases. A consortium of drug firms berated the government in a letter today for allowing the NHS to reject drugs at the cost of many lives, though these are mostly anti-obesity and related drugs that are expected to be hugely profitable as the world gets fatter. Reuters added: \"Pfizer, once the leader in the field, closed its antibiotic research centre in Connecticut in 2011, to the dismay of many scientists. It now focuses anti-bacterial work on vaccines. Others to have quit include Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, leaving only a handful of firms like \"GlaxoSmithKline and Merck &amp; Co in the game. Switzerland's Roche, however, has re-entered the arena through a $550 million tie-up with privately held Polyphor this month to develop and commercialise an experimental antibiotic against hospital superbugs.\" Marie Diron, senior economic adviser to the EY Eurozone Forecast, says a look beneath the headline figures in today's Eurozone inflation data shows it is a long term problem: \"Today's inflation data are interesting not so much about the headline inflation rate, which we knew would be very low, but about evidence of how broad-based downward price pressures are. Lower energy prices have contributed to bring inflation down. This often proves to be temporary. Much more of a concern is the fall in inflation for non-energy goods. Prices of a wide range of these goods are either stagnating or falling. Inflation has also come down to very low levels for a range of services. These trends highlight the squeeze on profit margins from subdued demand in the Eurozone. \"This environment is unlikely to change in the near future, which means that the ECB should be ready not only for a long period of low inflation but also for the possibility that deflation sets in. In our view, the ECB should do more to avoid deflation. One possibility would be to provide clearer forward guidance about its monetary policy. This could have a significant impact on the euro exchange rate which would both help raise inflation and boost growth.\" Looks like the cigarette smuggling dispute between Spain and Gibraltar is going to rumble on after EU officials said Madrid's near blockade of the island is lawful. Maybe blockade is a bit over the top. Maybe extra security is a better phrase. Well, Britain is not going to be happy. the extra checks that have upset so many locals are likely to carry on. But who knows, maybe the Spanish have a point. Maybe they are suffering from Gibraltar's ultra low cigarette tax, which makes its ciggies 40% cheaper than those sold on the mainland. Come on Rock inhabitants, you know smoking is bad for you. Put a decent tax on fags. The the Spanish would have to think again, cos they always undermine their principled stand against Gibraltar's independence when they refuse to give up Cueta, the \"autonomous city of Spain\" located on the north African coast where Tunisia should be. AP is reporting that not only is the one child policy to be relaxed (parents can have two children if only one parent was an only child rather than previous policy of both parents being only children), but a host of business measures have also been agreed. In that vein, China's leaders have promised to open its markets wider to private and foreign competitors. The country's consumption tax will be expanded to cover polluting products. Property tax reform wil be accelerated. New environmental taxes to be devised. Also sectors protected from foreign investment to be opened up. AP said Chinese leaders are under pressure to replace a \"tapped-out growth model based on exports and investment\". It said: \"The ruling party pledged in Friday's report to allow the creation of privately owned banks and to allow the market to allocate resources moves that will help more efficient private companies. \"As for foreign companies, the plan pledges to ease limits on foreign investment in e-commerce and other industries.\" Annalisa Piazza, analyst at Newedge Strategy, said in an note that ECB details of next week's LTRO early repayments, just announced, illustrate how weak the European financial system remains. \"On Wed, 5 banks will repay a total of €3.155bn of the first 3y LTRO and 3 banks will repay a very modest €0.431bn of the second 3y LTRO. The total amount is just a touch below market expectations of €4bn (Reuters poll) and around €2bn below the average repayments of the past 4 weeks,\" she said. \"Around €380bn out of the total €1013bn borrowed has been repaid so far. The ECB remains \"alert\" on the development of liquidity conditions (excess liquidity below €200bn) but Draghi made clear during last week's press conference that there is no direct correlation between liquidity and eonia rates. As such, no additional action was needed at the current juncture given the limited movements in money market rates. That said, the tone of the ECB remained extremely dovish and Draghi left the door open to any option in the coming months. We rule out that further liquidity will be injected in early 2014 but Q4 additional measures are still in the cards.\" ... while French, Spanish and Dutch draft plans barely make it, the European Commission said today. If you want to know what losing national self determination feels like, you need look no further than the Brussels' judgements on national budgets. Poland and Croatia face sanctions for running persistently high deficits. According to some analysts, Poland's misdeeds could hamper its entry to the euro Anyway, the review marks the first time Brussels has enjoyed such gorgeous, unalloyed power to criticise the finance proposals of member states, at least those inside the eurozone. Technically, the EU's executive arm is doing no more than reviewing the main assumptions of draft national budgets to assess if they are in line with EU laws. This is before they are submitted to national parliaments. However, the commission can demand a revised budget plan from a euro zone country if its draft clearly breaks EU rules, There are 19 EU countries under investigation at the moment for breaking various rules, after Germany was added this week for running monster current account surpluses that Brussels believes could be as bad for the currency zone as large annual deficits. Italy, the eurozone's third biggest economy, wants some leeway because its public debt is rising rather than falling and it suffers chronically low growth. \"There is a risk that the draft budgetary plan for 2014 will not be compliant with the rules,\" the commission said in a statement. \"In particular, the debt reduction benchmark in 2014 is not respected,\" it said. The commission said that the eurozone's second biggest economy France had taken the recommended steps to reduce its budget gap below 3 percent in 2013, and its 2014 draft budget is in line with EU budget rules, but with no margin for error, reported Reuters . Also, France's structural reform plans made only \"limited progress\", the commission said. There is an exaggerated sense of the story in that headline, but nonetheless it is positive for employment in Aberdeen and Shetland, even if it will have the green lobby crying into its nettle tea (I prefer strawberry with a hint of mango). Aberdeen-based EnQuest said it will generate billions in taxpayer revenues, create 20,000 construction jobs and 1,000 ongoing roles with its development of the Kraken oilfield east of the Shetland Islands. It will invest £4bn as part of the project. The plans are understood to represent the largest UK North Sea investment announced this year. The government has handed the company oil allowances enabling it to claim tax relief on around £800m of profits, which offsets the \"billions in taxpayer revenues\", which these days mean extra income tax, national insurance and VAT, not corporation tax. All hail the holders of capital, we bow before you. Back to the story. EnQuest chief executive Amjad Bseisu said: \"Kraken is a transformational project for EnQuest and we are delighted to be able to proceed with it, working with the Government and our partners to maximise the extraction of approximately 140 million barrels of oil in this field, over its 25-year-long life. \"It is only by combining our skills and expertise with fiscal incentives, such as heavy oil allowances, that really substantial projects like Kraken are possible.\" Along with Estonia. Eurostat said: \"In October 2013, the lowest annual rates were observed in Greece (-1.9%), Bulgaria (-1.1%) and Cyprus (-0.5%), and the highest in Estonia and the United Kingdom (both 2.2%) and Finland (1.7%). Compared with September 2013, annual inflation fell in twenty-three Member States, remained stable in one and rose in four. The lowest 12- month average rates up to October 2013 were registered in Greece (-0.4%), Latvia (0.3%) and Sweden (0.5%), and the highest in Romania (3.7%), Estonia (3.5%), Croatia and the Netherlands (both 2.9%). \"The largest upward impacts to euro area annual inflation came from electricity (+0.11 percentage points), accommodation services (+0.09) and tobacco (+0.08), while fuels for transport (-0.31), telecommunications (-0.16) and heating oil (-0.08) had the biggest downward impacts. \" It illustrates the power of oil to move inflation up and down. While it is a huge drag on prices at the moment, an upwards move in the oil price would quickly reverse the situation. Says the New York Post, which is obviously not the final arbiter on healthcare policy, but the headlines tweeted by Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider are not going to make for enjoyable reading in the White House. It is a lesson to all governments that a dodgy, hurried website can let down years of good work. Euro areaannual inflation was 0.7% in October 2013, down from 1.1% in September.

EU down to 0.9% Food giant Nestle is to create 1,600 jobs for young people over the next three years, and hundreds of paid work experience placements. The company, which still wrestles with accusations of selling baby milk to African mothers, is already a major employer in the UK with centres in Buxton (bottling), York (chocolate) and Cumbria (coffee), while its head office recently moved from Croydon to Gatwick in Sussex. The Press Association reports that the jobs will range from sales assistants to business management as well as working on the shop floor. Chief executive Fiona Kendrick said: \"Sadly, young people in the UK and Ireland are stuck in a catch-22 situation - they can't get a job without experience, but can't get experience without a job. \"As employers we value young people with experience, so we have to provide them with enough opportunities to gain it.\" Nestle said it will offer 300 paid work experience placements in its factories, offices and sales teams as well as helping social enterprise group MyKindaCrowd to give skills and employability training to more than 12,000 school and college students. The placements will be for four weeks and will pay above the national minimum wage. Should have said earlier, but it is never too late to talk about the Japanese stock market, which rose to a sixth month high last night at 15,165, up almost 2% on the day. The strengthening dollar had something to do with it and gains on Wall Street. The US stock market maintained its upward trajectory following doveish remarks by Janet Yellen (see earlier post). Abenomics seems to have lost is lustre, but if the US dollar rises then japanese exports have a free run and Toyota's profits will carry on rising. In an unrelated move, the Japanese government increased its target for greenhouse gas emissions, which was probably inevitable after the shutdown of all its nuclear power stations. Some of them may reopen, though the Fukushima disaster means they are likely to stay shut and Japan's reliance on imported liquid gas will continue. Reuters reports that Joerg Asmussen, European Central Bank board member, said this morning that eurozone governments must put in place ways to financially support their banks in case they need more capital. Speaking ahead of the Eurogroup's second day of meetings, Asmussen said health checks by the ECB found there were still plenty of banks with weak balance sheets. Today finance ministers are discussing backstops for banks in time for the ECB's asset quality review, the results of which are due in October 2014. \"We will continue to discuss this today,\" Asmussen said on entering the meeting. \"From the ECB side we always said it was absolutely necessary that we have credible backstops in place before the whole exercise starts, so we need three layers of backstops. These are first private markets, second domestic markets, or domestic bank rescue funds, and the third layer is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as it stands,\" he said.

But more interestingly, hinted that the feverish state of the London housing market was causing him concern and said it should be actively monitored by the authorities. At the moment the Treasury and the Bank of England are passing the buck between them over which one is responsible for an overheating housing market. The buck passing has annoyed Treasury select committee chairman and Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who has written to BoE governor Mark Carney asking him to clarify the position. Eurozone deflation fears are expected to heighten when the final readings for eurozone consumer price inflation (CPI) are published. They are expected to confirm price rises have slowed alarmingly. The ECB’s Erkki Liikanen and Yves Mersch will speak today with markets looking for more comments on the policy outlook. Analysts reckon there will also be much speculation on divides in the ECB board's ranks after the recent rate cut to 0.25%. The cut split opinion and pitted president Mario Draghi against some of his colleagues. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, said there is a general expectation for the FTSE 100 to open +5pts at 6675. \"Another positive performance from both the US and Asian equity sessions after FedChairwoman-elect Janet Yellen supported her pre-released text with a robust testimony before the Senate Banking committee in defending theFed’s policies and stating that she doesn’t see tapering of QE3 for a good while yet with benefits exceeding costs for now and early withdrawal a big risk amid a fragile recovery,\" he said in a note. He continued: \"Japan’s Nikkei again the outperformer (&gt;15,000) thanks to a weaker JPY (USD/JPY &gt;100) as officials signal they are prepared to fight to keep currency weak. Expectations and optimism about the release of some much-desired additional details on Chinese economic reforms next week also got markets excited helping China and Hong Kong muster good gains.\" Hi, I’m Phillip Inman, The Guardian’s economics correspondent. I’m stepping in for Graeme Wearden today. This morning we can look forward to euro area inflation at 10am. There’s an Ecofin ministers meeting today - last night the Eurogroup told Greece to make more progress in its negotiations with the troika There’s usually an Ecofin press conference around lunchtime. Janet Yellen was giving heavy hints in her testimony to Congress that she would keep monetary policy loose if given the job of succeeding Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve boss. There should be some more market and analyst reaction today. Also, I’ll keep an eye on the FTSE, which is coming off a peak in October, where it neared 6800.

We got the top one. Gold,\" Betty Smith finishes. Smith and Renwick, at 90 and 86 respectively, are the oldest people ever to win a Gold at the Sony awards (on Monday last week, for their show on BBC Radio Humberside). It's not even a lifetime's service to radio award – they have only been going six years. I think it is the mixture of intended and unintended comedy. It wouldn't work if they were just being funny by accident, but some of the more surreal moments wouldn't work if they were doing it on purpose. Reeves is a nice, presentable 35-year-old, and this ensemble – a brace of raucous older women, with a pretend-disapproving straight man – will be as familiar to you when you hear it as Land of Hope and Glory. It's a bit Carry On, a bit Ealing, quintessentially English, ineffably funny. It's been significantly updated – the stand-out moment for me was when Beryl and Betty did a rap over Don't Stop Me Now (they do the words – \"I'm a sex machine, ready to reload\", which is droll for their dry delivery – but they also chat all the way through: \"I think you were out of tune, there\". \"I don't think I was. I think I was good.\") It's all a lot more artful than just two people chatting, and Reeves is clearly a bit (just a smidge … a tiny, tiny bit) vexed to have been cut out of the picture. \"I honestly don't think some people writing about it have listened to it. I can't just put the faders on and let them get on with it. They wouldn't have a clue.\" But his co-presenters themselves appreciate him plenty. \"I tell you what,\" Beryl says fondly, at one point, \"we couldn't do what you're doing.\" \"Couldn't be twiddling knobs,\" Betty avers. This is the first show they have recorded since winning the award, and they are under an avalanche of well-wishing. Someone even cold-called Beryl to ask her to write a piece about what it was like being the same age as the queen (this went down really badly, the unsolicited contact. \"It's not nice,\" she told Betty. \"Don't you entertain anybody, whatever you do.\" \"I won't. I'll tell them to get knotted.\" \"Well, no, don't be rude.\") Renwick and Smith met in 1999, at a social club they both joined when they were widowed (Betty in 1998, Beryl in the 80s). They didn't meet Reeves until they did a tour of the radio station with this social club. He recalls: \"They said: 'Can you play any Frank Sinatra? Aren't you handsome?' and then started ruffling my hair.\" This was the encounter that gave David the idea for the show. It's funny, and I think it's saucier than I realise. At one point Betty says about David: \"He wants his legs wiping down, doesn't he Beryl?\" I'm a bit scared of what that even means. Beryl is probably the chattier of the two, but Betty has a laugh that is almost ceaseless. She's like one of those nuclear power stations whose alarm is going constantly, so that when you hear the sound of silence, you know something really serious has happened. I'd say they are pretty competitive. \"She's had no children, you know,\" Betty says, as a complete non sequitur, in the middle of Beryl talking about her first wage cheque. \"I've had 10.\" Starting at 21, finishing at 39, Betty was pregnant on and off for 18 years but even the youngest is now 51, and the oldest 70. Her grandchildren alone would constitute a bigger audience than a lot of things get on BBC4. She used to have an actual bar in her house, but since her husband died, has scaled down her decorative alcohol to a shelf of miniatures all the way round her living room (I didn't see her house, I was just told about it. \"But I've never been drunk in my life,\" she says, to clarify). I'm interested to know whether they have renegotiated their fee since the award. That's what Frank Skinner would have done, if he had won. \"We're getting paid now,\" Beryl says, \"but we would never be the kind of people who would ask for money.\" Betty adds: \"I want to keep on doing this for as long as I can.\" Worst. Negotiators. Ever.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said it would try new methods to cool the reactors, but would stick with its original plan, announced a month ago, to stabilise radiation levels and bring the units to a stable condition – a process known as \"cold shutdown\" – within six to nine months. Officials said the melting of fuel rods in three reactors did not raise the risk of explosions and would not affect the timeline for bringing the plant under control. But Tepco's roadmap has looked increasingly unworkable recently, after it said uranium fuel rods in three reactors had been left exposed and had melted hours after the earthquake on 11 March. On Friday, the company revealed fuel in the No 1 reactor had partially melted and fallen to the bottom of the pressurised vessel which holds the reactor core together. Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at Tepco, said reactors Nos 2 and 3 were likely to have suffered similar problems. \"The findings at the No 1 reactor indicate the likelihood that water level readings in the other reactors aren't accurate,\" he said. \"It could be that a meltdown similar to that in the No 1 reactor has occurred.\" Tepco said it will abandon plans to stabilise the reactors by filling them with water, after leaks were discovered in the main vessel of the No 1 reactor. Flooding them would increase the chances of vast quantities of contaminated water leaking out of the complex. Instead, workers will attempt to cool the melted fuel by circulating water that has already built up inside the reactors. The Fukushima Daiichi complex now contains thousands of tonnes of water – enough to fill 36 Olympic-sized swimming pools – adding to fears that the liquid could find its way into groundwater and the Pacific ocean if efforts fail to store it safely. Questions have been raised about Tepco's original explanation for the crisis. For weeks it claimed power to vital cooling systems inside the reactors was knocked out by the 15 metre tsunami that followed the earthquake. But recently retrieved data from the plant showed the earthquake had been more powerful than three of the six reactors were built to withstand, raising the possibility that at least one of the reactors was disabled before the waves arrived. \"This was clearly a larger earthquake than we had forecast,\" Matsumoto said. \"It would have been hard to anticipate this.\" In another revelation that reflects badly on the firm's ability to manage the crisis, reports suggest a Tepco worker manually cut the power to the cooling system in the No 1 reactor, after data showed it was cooling too quickly in the immediate aftermath of the quake. \"At the time we could not have known that the tsunami was coming and that we would lose power,\" Matsumoto said. Japan's earthquake and tsunami killed more than 15,000 people, while another 9,500 are still missing. More than 80,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes after the nuclear accident, with no indication of when they might be able to return. The crisis prompted the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to announce a review of Japan's energy policy. He ordered the temporary shutdown of another nuclear plant deemed vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis, and abandoned plans to build 14 new nuclear power plants by 2030. Any adjustment to Tepco's roadmap would have caused embarrassment for Kan, who has been widely criticised for his handling of the crisis. \"In terms of achieving cold-shutdown status within six to nine months, I believe we should be able to proceed without changing the timeframe,\" he told parliament on Monday. Even if Tepco meets its deadline, experts predicted work to decontaminate the site and decommission the reactors would take years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/aug/16/nuclear-energy-renaissance","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-16T14:30:01Z","webTitle":"The reality of nuclear energy is inconsistent with dreams of a renaissance | Michael Dittmar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/aug/16/nuclear-energy-renaissance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/aug/16/nuclear-energy-renaissance","fields":{"headline":"The reality of nuclear energy is inconsistent with dreams of a renaissance","bodyText":"Repeatedly in recent years there have been calls for a revival of nuclear power. Yet that renaissance never seems to come. Of the more than 200 countries in the world, only 30 use nuclear power. In July 2010, a total of 439 nuclear power plants with a net installed capacity of 373.038 gigawatts (GW) were connected to various national electricity grids, about 1.2GW more than at the beginning of 2006. Roughly 16% of total energy needs (up to 25% in the highly industrialised countries) are now met by electric energy. Nuclear fission's contribution to total electric energy has decreased from about 18% more than 10 years ago to about 14% in 2008. On a worldwide scale, nuclear energy is thus only a small component of the global energy mix, and its share, contrary to widespread belief, is not on the rise. During 2009, for example, nuclear power plants provided 2,560 terawatt hours (TWh)– equivalent to 2,560bn kilowatt hours of electric energy, about 1.6% lower than during 2008 and almost 4% lower than during the record year of 2006. Early results for the first four months of 2010 for the OECD countries indicate that so far the 2010 results are as low or lower than last year. During the next five years, on average, roughly 10 new nuclear reactors are expected to become operational every year. But this assumes that all are constructed according to schedule, and the nuclear industry has rarely met its promised construction deadlines. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), 17 new reactors should have become operational between 2007 and 2009. But only five came onstream during this period – three in 2007 and two in 2009. Moreover, four reactors were de-commissioned during 2009, and a larger number of reactors in Japan and Germany are not in use, owing to various technical stoppages. At least 100 older and smaller reactors will most likely be closed over the next 10-15 years. Furthermore, during the past 10 years, only about two-thirds of worldwide demand for nuclear fuel was met from resources obtained from mining. The remaining 20,000 tonnes came from so-called secondary uranium sources – mainly inventories held by utilities and governments, reprocessed nuclear fuel, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. The supply from these sources will drop by roughly 10,000 tonnes at the end of 2013, when the Megatons to Megawatt programme between Russia and the United States – which recycles highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear warheads into low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants – comes to an end. Current projections indicate that uranium shortages in the coming years can be avoided only if existing and new uranium mines operate according to plan. Indeed, extrapolations of global supply that foresee an increase in uranium mining are based on claims about the ability to expand output in Kazakhstan. So far, uranium mining in Kazakhstan has increased roughly as expected, from 4,357 tonnes in 2005 to 14,000 tonnes in 2009. But it remains to be seen if the uranium mining in this country can indeed increase further. According to the WNA's latest estimates, from July 2010, the expected uranium extraction figure for 2010 has actually been decreased to 15,000 tonnes. The view that the amount of energy derived from nuclear power worldwide will continue its slow decrease during the coming years is further supported by the 2008 annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency, which coordinates the long-term uranium needs of nuclear power plants within the European Union. According to the agency's forecast, uranium demand in Europe will fall from 21,747 tonnes in 2010 to roughly 16,000 tonnes by 2024. These numbers indicate that the EU, currently producing about one-third of the world's nuclear electric energy, is heading for a reduction in nuclear-energy production of up to 20% over the coming 10 years. One can also expect that the current worldwide economic crisis will not help to accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants and new uranium mines. In summary, the hard facts about nuclear energy are inconsistent with the possibility of a worldwide renaissance of nuclear energy. Indeed, they point toward a continuing slow phase-out of nuclear energy in most of the large OECD countries. It seems unavoidable that energy consumers, especially in many rich countries, will have to learn to exchange their current worries about the distant future consequences of global warming for the reality of energy shortages during periods of peak demand. Such shortages could result either in chaotic supplies and power outages or in a coordinated policy of energy rationing. In the absence of nuclear-energy revival, most of us will be forced to reduce our direct energy consumption. Let us hope that we can learn to adapt to simpler – though perhaps still satisfying – lifestyles. • Michael Dittmar is a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule), and works at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva.

In a memorable episode of The Simpsons, Mr Burns deploys an army of PR advisers and spin doctors to ensure he gets elected to Congress. The personification of predatory American capitalism is shocked to find how bad his public image is among the \"Joe Six-packs\" of the fictional town. He is even more shocked when his election team suggest the best way to portray him as a man of the people is to break bread with the proletariat. Inevitably this leads to the owner of Springfield's nuclear power plant sitting down to dinner with Homer Simpson and his family at Evergreen Terrace, all filmed for a Republican party commercial. Of course the outcome is both disastrous and hilarious, especially given that Marge and Lisa are rooting for the Democrats while the boorish antics of Homer and his brood at the dining table ruin the publicity stunt. Perhaps Mike Nesbitt has never watched The Simpsons, or seen this particular episode. The newly elected leader of the Ulster Unionist party had his very own Mr Burns Goes to Washington moment on Sunday just 24 hours after his triumph. On a BBC politics show, Nesbitt suggested it might be a good idea for him to spend 24 hours in the company of poor people. They might \"adopt\" him for a day in order that he can get direct first-hand knowledge of how the plebians cope with the recession. Educated at elite Belfast private school Campbell College, before securing a double first at Cambridge, Nesbitt is at least honest enough to admit he doesn't come from humble origins. Yet his notion that he could reach out to the economically downtrodden by living with them for a day was another of those classic toe-curling stunts politicians deploy to show themselves one of the people or to get down with the kids. Think of William Hague's baseball cap on the big dipper, Tony Blair strumming a guitar alongside Noel Gallagher or even – for those of you old enough and with good memories – David Owen doing the SDP rap (no, seriously!) and you get the picture. The proposal has been an early gift for the Democratic Unionist party. One of the DUP's rising stars, Simon Hamilton – who represents the same constituency as Nesbitt – displayed his own comedic talents, saying the last thing a family struggling to make ends meet needed was Nesbitt coming to stay. Nesbitt, a former Ulster TV news anchor, is an experienced broadcaster and PR operator. Although he certainly means well and is undoubtedly genuine in his concern for those at the bottom of the pile, his political version of The Secret Millionaire appears to have backfired only 24 hours into his new job. Instead of stunts, the UUP leader, seeking to turn his party's fortunes around after more than a decade of decline, should be thinking of substance. In particular the big question of whether the UUP should remain in a five-party power sharing coalition dominated by Sinn Féin and the DUP. At present the combined ranks of the 106 assembly members not in a government party totals two: Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice and the Greens' Steven Agnew. There are voices within the UUP, and they will continue to grow, crying out for the party to form the big opposition bloc they say is needed to hold the Northern Ireland executive to account and to deepen democracy in general. Even if Nesbitt is not inclined towards opposition he could, down the line, be forced into it as the party membership seek to make the UUP distinct from the DUP. Meanwhile, if he wants to really know how the poor live, he could buy a DVD boxset of his namesake Rab C Nesbitt, the Glaswegian comedy character who survives against social adversity and often his own failings in his string vest in Govan. That might give the former television presenter plenty of insight into how those at the sharp end are coping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/11/improved-technology-nuclear-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"Letters: Fourth generation nuclear plants are far from a cure-all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/improved-technology-nuclear-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/11/improved-technology-nuclear-risk","fields":{"headline":"Fourth generation nuclear plants are far from a cure-all","bodyText":"We quite agree with George Monbiot's assessment of the nuclear industry's shortcomings, but even were the secrecy, corruption and commercially motivated safety shortcuts to magically disappear, the fundamental problems with the technology remain (The nuclear industry stinks. But that is not a reason to ditch nuclear power, 5 July). George dismisses safety fears over waste stores as \"inexplicable\" on the basis that nuclear fuels originate from mined rocks – but these ores frequently contain 1% or less uranium, surrounded by other minerals. While some have higher concentrations, few come anywhere near to the proportion of radioactive compounds to be found in a waste drum. Would one similarly dismiss the risk of poisoning from high concentrations of arsenic merely because it can also be mined from natural deposits? Building waste stores that will have to last many times longer than the current timespan of human civilisation is, on any quantification of risk, a fraught task. The fourth-generation nuclear plants of which George speaks so highly are far from a cure-all. While better, they will still produce waste that remains radioactive for centuries, can still allow plutonium to be diverted for weapon production and, most crucially of all, do not yet exist and are unlikely to be built on a commercial scale for decades. Such points have little to do with the decision facing Britain right now, with the government proposing new reactors firmly based on current technologies and their long-lived waste. Were our opposition to nuclear power based merely on the murkiness of the industry, we might agree with George. Sadly, unless the government can be diverted from its course, it will be boosting a technology that diverts investment from renewables and encourages more countries to acquire the materials and expertise necessary for a nuclear weapons programme. Kate Hudson Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament • What I never understand about George Monbiot's position on nuclear power is why he doesn't devote as much effort to arguing for carbon rationing or Tradable Energy Quotas (TEQs). TEQs are a way of using the market to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Every adult is given an equal free entitlement of TEQs units each week. Other energy users (government, industry etc) bid for their units at a weekly auction. If you use less than your entitlement, you can sell your surplus. If you need more, you can buy them. All trading takes place at a single national price, which rises and falls in line with demand. When you buy energy, units corresponding to the amount of energy you have bought are deducted from your TEQs account, in addition to your money payment. The redistribution from rich to poor that TEQs would entail surely fits better with Monbiot's general philosophy than support for the nuclear industry.

The absence of tangible progress in the next 48 hours will rob diplomacy of much of its remaining credibility and substantially increase the chance of a devastating conflict. This is the third round of talks between Iran and a group of six world powers, and arguably the most critical. The benchmark for success at the two prior rounds was set extremely low. In Istanbul in April, the talks were deemed a success because the Iranian delegation showed up and said it was prepared in principle to talk about the nuclear programme. Round two in Baghdad in May made no real progress but was said not to have failed because the Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, said words to the effect that Tehran was prepared to discuss its current enrichment of U-235, uranium's most fissile isotope, at a 20% level of purity. This is the greatest proliferation concern as it would be relatively easy to turn it into weapons-grade, 90%-enriched uranium, should Iran decide to make a bomb. In Baghdad, Jalili did not put forward a concrete proposal setting out what Iran would require to stop 20% enrichment, and ignored an offer put forward by the six-nation group and presented by Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, of 20%-enriched fuel plates for a medical research reactor in Tehran, advice and equipment for nuclear safety and spare parts for Iran's commercial airliners, if Iran halted its own 20% enrichment. \"Jalili did not even give the proposal a passing glance when it was handed over,\" said a participant at the Baghdad talks. Worse still, in the weeks that followed the Iranian delegation even denied having even seen the offer from the six nations (the US, UK, France, Germany, China and Russia). On this tenuous thread the parties have agreed to meet for a third time in Moscow, but western diplomats arrive insisting that there can be no repeat of Baghdad, where Jalili showed readiness to orate but not to bargain, and that they are not interested in continuing \"talks for the sake of talks\". Their hope is that Jalili will come to Moscow with a counter-proposal that could be the starting point for a deal. After issuing veiled threats not to come to Russia at all, Jalili has in the last few days said that he would clarify his country's position there. If he does, most observers believe that, in return for suspension of 20% enrichment, he will repeat Tehran's longstanding demand for international recognition of its right to enrich uranium, something the UN security council had asked it to stop in six separate resolutions. He may also demand a relaxation of sanctions, something he did not mention at the Baghdad talks. Western officials say are not prepared to give away something irreversible, recognition of Iran's right to enrich, in return for something that was all too reversible, like turning down the dials on Iran's uranium enrichment centrifuges, say from 20% to 3.5% (the level needed for nuclear power stations) . For the security council to abandon its position on enrichment, they argue, Iran would have to provide cast-iron guarantees of transparency, accepting intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and giving a full account of any past experimentation with weapons design. Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who has just produced a memoir of his days at the negotiating table, argues that Tehran would make such a bargain, although some Iran watchers argued that since Mousavian's time – he was last directly involvedin 2005 – the regime of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has become more embattled, more dysfunctional and much less able to effect a strategic change of course. Another possibility in Moscow is that Iran can be induced to accept the confidence-building deal it has been offered involving cessation of 20% enrichment if the offer is sweetened with some form of sanctions relief, such as postponement of an EU oil embargo, due from 1 July. However, there are no guarantees that Iran would accept such an enhanced deal, and there is considerable reluctance in the west to offer it. From the western perspective it would represent a reward for Iran's opacity at the talks, and a disproportionate exchange for suspension of 20%-enriched uranium production. Iran has already accumulated enough to keep its medical research reactor going for at least five years, and top Iranian officials have hinted that the country has no immediate need to make more. However, Iranian hawks have come up with a new use for uranium enriched to higher levels. Last week the navy announced plans to build a nuclear powered submarine – an incredibly difficult endeavour involving the construction of a submarine around a mini nuclear reactor. Whether Iran is capable of making one or not, the declared goal of building such a submarine (which would not fall under IAEA safeguards), provides a technical rationale for enriching uranium to 20% or more. Tactically the nuclear submarine announcement has many advantages for Iran at the negotiating table. But if it contributes to the final breakdown of a diplomatic process that is already fast running out steam, it could represent a huge strategic miscalculation. No one knows whether the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu's ever-present threat to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities is a bluff, but if the negotiations collapse in Moscow, an Israeli attack will be more likely than if the talks had never begun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/19/energy-bill-investment-gas-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-19T11:55:54Z","webTitle":"Energy bill must vow to 'decarbonise' sector or face losing investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/19/energy-bill-investment-gas-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/19/energy-bill-investment-gas-power","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill must vow to 'decarbonise' sector or face losing investment","bodyText":"The government must set a clear \"twilight\" on gas-fired power generation in its forthcoming energy bill, or face a dearth of much-needed investment into the power sector, according to a top Tory MP. Tim Yeo, the chairman of the influential energy and climate change select committee, said the bill should provide \"confidence, certainty and long-term stability\", and that this could only be done through setting a clear target for \"decarbonising\" the electricity sector. Without such a framework, he warned, the required investment in the energy sector – estimated at more than £200bn in the next ten years – would be doubtful. Providing a clear end to the use of \"unabated\" gas – that is, gas-fired electricity generation operating without the technology to capture and store the resulting carbon emissions – would ensure a clear limit on how long gas-fired power stations would continue to spew out carbon dioxide at their current rate, Yeo said. This issue is key to whether gas-fired power generation can have a long-term future in the UK, because energy utilities are being encouraged by the government to build new gas-fired power stations today, without a long-term view as to their future. Yeo said that the government should come clean on its view of the future of gas-fired power. Plants built today are likely to operate for at least 25 years, and under the current energy bill it is not clear whether they could continue \"unabated\" during that time, or whether they would need to be fitted with expensive capture and storage technology at a later date. If a new fleet of plants were built in the next few years, and still operating in 25 years, it would be all but impossible to meet the UK's long-term target of cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, according to the committee. But if new plants are not built in the next few years, the government could face electricity shortages, because of the difficulty of building alternatives such as windfarms and nuclear reactors in time to meet the expected shortfall of electricity. Yeo said: \"Whether or not the government sets a clear carbon reduction target on the face of the energy bill will be a key test of the coalition's commitment to tackle climate change.\" In the forthcoming bill, ministers are expected to set out a framework by which gas-fired power stations would be allowed to opearate throughout the next decade and potentially beyond, while new coal-fired power stations would be effectively banned. This would be achieved by an \"emissions performance standard\" that would allow gas-fired generation – which has lower direct carbon emissions than coal when burnt for electricity – but would be too low for coal-fired power stations, unless emissions were captured and consigned to long-term underground storage. But Yeo said that the government must be much more explicit about the constraints it wanted to put on energy generation. He said: \"If we want energy companies to make multibillion pound investments in new nuclear, carbon capture and storage and offshore wind and wave power, then the energy bill needs to establish a framework that provides confidence, certainty and long-term stability.\" As a step towards such a framework, Yeo urged the government to follow the advice of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the body set up under the Climate Change Act to advise ministers on how to meet the UK's emissions targets. The CCC, which is due to give evidence on Tuesday to the energy and climate change committee on how the bill should work in favour of long-term climate targets, has previously recommended the electricity sector is set a target of cutting carbon emissions to 50g/KWh by 2030 – what the CCC has referred to as \"the decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2030\". This would involve a phasing out of gas-fired power stations by 2030, or by fitting such plants with CCS technology to take their emissions effectively to zero by that date. Ministers have shied away from such a firm target, however, preferring to fudge the language of their aims by referring instead in the preamble to the proposed bill to \"largely\" decarbonising the electricity sector \"in the 2030s\". Renewable energy companies and green groups regard this weaker language as a serious watering down of the government's commitments, and a move calculated to spur short-term investment in the gas industry, to the detriment of alternatives. Ministers have made clear that they want a sizeable construction programme of new gas-fired power stations in the UK over the next five years in order to make up for the ageing coal-fired and nuclear power stations that will be phased out – mainly because new gas-fired power stations are relatively cheap and easy to build. However, green campaigners warn that new gas-fired power plants built today will still be spewing out carbon in 25 years time, perhaps much longer. That would put the UK well beyond its carbon-cutting commitments for 2020 and 2050. Yeo, a former cabinet minister in the last Tory government, said: \"If ministers choose to ignore the advice of their independent advisors [the CCC] and do not set a target to cut electricity sector emissions to 50g/KWh by 2030, then deeper – and more expensive – carbon cuts wills have to be found in other sectors, such as transport.\" He said the government should better recognise that investors need the reassurance of a long-term policy framework: \"An unambiguous objective to clean up the electricity sector by 2030 would give energy companies the confidence to invest and innovate, and should be one of the cornerstones of electricity market reform.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/jul/22/george-osborne-green-plans-tory","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-22T20:26:00Z","webTitle":"George Osborne wrecking green plans to placate MPs – senior Tory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/22/george-osborne-green-plans-tory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/jul/22/george-osborne-green-plans-tory","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne wrecking green plans to placate MPs – senior Tory","bodyText":"The Treasury has been accused of undermining government attempts to secure the future energy requirements for the country and improve the green electricity supply, by meddling in its energy bill, which MPs now say is \"unworkable\". Tim Yeo, the Tory chair of the Commons energy and climate change select committee and an ex-minister, told the Guardian that George Osborne is sacrificing the green energy plans in order to placate Conservative backbenchers, many of whom are campaigning against wind farms and new pylons in their constituencies. He said: \"They are working particularly to target some Conservative backbenchers, pursuing a policy designed to prove that they are not going to get into so-called costly green initiatives. It is extraordinary.\" Yeo's criticisms came as a letter came to light sent by Osborne to Ed Davey, making clear that unabated gas power should remain a dominant part of the UK's energy mix until 2030. This position, the culmination of more than 18 months of backroom maneouvrings by the gas industry and the chancellor and his advisors, would be fatal for the UK's climate change targets, but would play well to Tory backbenchers. The gas industry has been lobbying heavily for two years to be seen as a \"green\" fuel, because it produces less carbon than coal when burned. The Guardian last year uncovered evidence of the industry manipulating reports to show gas in a more favourable light, as a cheaper and still green alternative to renewable energy. Osborne's adviser Prof Dieter Helm of Oxford has publicly stated the case for gas over renewables on many occasions. Without sweeping changes, the energy bill could provoke a crisis within the energy industry that would raise consumer bills and imperil climate change targets, wrecking the confidence of investors in the process, says a report by the energy and climate select committee released on Monday. Yeo said: \"The Treasury has never been signed up to the green agenda, but this has got much more serious in the past year. Their interventions on the energy bill, and clear interference over [renewable energy subsidies] ROCs have shown this – it all adds up to a clear sign that they are not supportive of progress on the low-carbon energy sector.\" The high profile attack adds to growing criticism of Osborne's leadership of the Treasury. The former chancellor Lord Lawson called at the weekend for Osborne to drop his political role as head of strategy for the Conservatives in government, in order to focus on the economy. A poll out on Monday found that nearly half of those polled believe the chancellor should be ousted – including 22% of Tory voters. As well as blaming the chancellor's desire to curry favour with anti-green Tories, Yeo also warned of \"theologians\" within the Treasury who were wedded to complex systems of support for low-carbon energy called \"contracts for difference\", because theoretically these can be regarded as different from subsidies which are unpopular on the Tory backbenches. The proposals for such a system have been made over-complicated by the Treasury's anxiety to avoid the subsidy label, he said. The energy bill, if passed by parliament, would represent the biggest shakeup of the electricity market since privatisation. The systems of subsidies for large-scale renewable energy would be scrapped, and nuclear power would be encouraged through a new system of \"contracts for difference\" through which companies would sign long-term agreements to supply and pay for low-carbon generation. But critics have said the arrangements are too complex and would act as a bar to smaller companies from the market, including many renewable power suppliers. The select committee report says: • Plans for the government to underwrite the costs of new green energy contracts, in order to lower the cost of capital, were scrapped after the Treasury intervened and instead companies will now be guaranteed a future price under the \"contracts for difference\". The MPs say this is over complicated and even unworkable. • A spending cap set by the Treasury – which limits the green levies that can be passed on to consumers in energy bills – could introduce an unacceptable level of risk to companies who are looking to build wind, solar, wave or tidal power plants. This is because the levy cap will ration the number of contracts available, creating uncertainty among investors about which projects will receive support. • There is concern that the new contract system will reinforce the dominance of the \"Big Six\" energy companies and prevent new entrants into the electricity market. The government says it wants to increase competition and improve the opportunities for new entrants in the electricity market. But witnesses told the committee that the energy bill as it stands will deliver the opposite, threatening the viability of smaller-scale independent energy companies. • The bill fails to tackle consumption and how demand for energy could be cut. The committee's report comes after ministers were last week forced to delay an announcement on reforms to renewable energy subsidies because the Treasury demanded cuts to the subsidies for onshore wind farms that were twice as deep as the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) was prepared to make. There is turmoil within government over energy policy, which has pitted Osborne against the LibDems, led by Nick Clegg and energy secretary Ed Davey. The Decc's chief civil servant – permanent secretary Moira Wallace – resigned abruptly last week after four years in the post amid accusations that she was being made a scapegoat for the politicians in charge. \"Decc is a department in chaos,\" said Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of the select committee. \"These are hugely important policies for our future energy supply but there is an impression of confusion and lack of clarity that will scare away investors.\" Renewable energy companies fear they will lose out under the bill's current provisions. Gordon Edge, director of policy at the wind industry body RenewableUK, said: \"If the government gets the reform wrong, we will see less diversity in the market, higher prices for consumers, over reliance on imported dirty fuels, and the potential of tens of thousands of low carbon jobs lost. \"The government only has a limited amount of time to get this into working order. There's a lack of clarity now on both the short and medium term, and that's bad news [as] major investment decisions, with all the implications for jobs and economic growth they entail, will be made soon.\" Davey said: \"The energy bill will enable us to make radical changes to the electricity market that deliver investment in secure, low carbon, affordable energy. We are determined to use the pre-legislative scrutiny period to develop a robust and effective bill with the interests of both consumers and investors at the heart.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/sep/12/french-nuclear-plant-rocked-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-12T16:11:00Z","webTitle":"Explosion at French nuclear waste plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/12/french-nuclear-plant-rocked-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/sep/12/french-nuclear-plant-rocked-explosion","fields":{"headline":"Explosion at French nuclear waste plant","bodyText":"An explosion at a French nuclear waste processing plant that killed one person and injured four others sparked fears of a radioactive leak on Monday. An emergency safety cordon was thrown around the Marcoule nuclear site near Nimes in the south of France immediately after a furnace used to melt nuclear waste exploded and caused a fire. It was lifted later in the day after France's nuclear safety agency, the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN), said there was no danger to the public. Reports said the body of one male worker at the plant had been \"found carbonised\", but there was no evidence that the explosion had caused any radioactive leak, though the ASN admitted there was the \"possibility of a leak of low-level radioactivity, but no shooting of radioactivity in the air\". There was no information as to the cause of the explosion. The accident came just a week after the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, bucked the anti-nuclear trend following Japan's Fukushima disaster and pledged €1bn (£860m) of new investment in atomic power. Despite growing worldwide concern about the safety of nuclear plants – Germany has announced it is phasing its nuclear plants out — Sarkozy said the moratorium on new nuclear reactors adopted by some countries since the Japanese nuclear crisis in March \"makes no sense\". \"There is no alternative to nuclear energy today,\" he told journalists at the time. \"We are going to devote €1bn to the nuclear programme of the future, particularly fourth-generation technology.\" He also promised \"substantial resources\" to strengthen research into nuclear safety and a further €1.3bn investment in renewable energy. A spokesman for the French energy giant EDF, whose subsidiary company Centraco ran the part of the Marcoule site , insisted it was \"an industrial accident\" and not a nuclear accident. He said the staff member killed was standing next to the furnace when he died, but insisted the explosion was contained within the oven area and did not damage the structure of the building. An EDF spokesman said: \"According to our initial information it was an explosion in an oven used to melt metallic radioactive waste of a low level and very low-level radioactivity. In this kind of furnace there are two kinds of waste – metal waste (hatches, pumps, tools) and combustible waste like gloves or workers' overalls.\" The ASN said it had activated its emergency plan after the explosion, which happened at about 11.45am local time (10.45am BST) and sparked a fire. The Marcoule site in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, which covers 140 hectares, was a military site for research into the atom bomb when it opened in 1956. It later produced France's first nuclear electricity. Today, it is home to a range of nuclear activities including fuel production and waste reprocessing and is partly used by the French nuclear power giant Areva. It also produces what is known as Mox (mixed oxide) fuel, made by recycling plutonium from nuclear weapons, with natural, reprocessed or depleted uranium, that can be used in light-water reactors used in nuclear power production. France's energy and ecology minister, Nathalie Kosciuscko-Morizet, flew to the site on Monday afternoon to take part in an \"evaluation of the eventual radiological impacts of the accident\", according to a ministry spokesperson. One of the injured nuclear workers was flown to Montpellier hospital by helicopter but an interior ministry statement said there had been \"no measure to confine or evacuate\" workers at the site. The explosion happened in the Centraco centre used by the firm Socodei, a sister company of the French electricity giant EDF. Professor Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, said: \"Centraco processes very low, low and intermediate level waste that comes from industry and research activities. \"These can include metal objects (drums, metallic boxes, containers), waste clothing (gloves and laboratory overalls), and waste solutions (oils, solvents and resins). The incinerator plant includes three chambers that operate up to 1,200°C. \"Metallic waste is melted and cast into ingots. Other waste is burned and the resulting ash and slag are immobilised and packed into metal drums before shipping to Centre de l'Aube storage, the low-level waste site. \"It is too early to be certain about the location of the explosion, or of the radioactivity that may be released. Should the explosion be associated with the Centraco plant, then it is likely that radiation levels will be low.\" Cécile Duflot, the secretary general of the political party Europe Ecology, called for \"real-time\" and \"transparent\" information on the incident on her Twitter account. In July, an explosion sparked a fire at a French nuclear power station just two days after the authorities found 32 safety concerns at the plant. The blaze at the Tricastin plant in Drôme in the Rhône valley, produced a thick cloud of black smoke. A mistral wind sent it south over a nearby motorway on one of the busiest travel days of the year as the French left for their summer holidays. EDF, which runs the power station, said the incident took place in an electric transformer situated in the non-nuclear part of the plant and had not resulted in any radiation leak or any other contamination. Immediately after the explosion, shares in EDF fell by 5.59% on the Paris stock exchange."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/26/naoto-kan-resigns-japan-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-26T08:03:00Z","webTitle":"Naoto Kan resigns as Japan's prime minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/naoto-kan-resigns-japan-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/26/naoto-kan-resigns-japan-pm","fields":{"headline":"Naoto Kan resigns as Japan's prime minister","bodyText":"The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, announced his resignation on Friday amid widespread criticism of his handling of the aftermath of the 11 March tsunami and the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But uncertainty grew over the identity of Japan's next leader – the country's seventh in six years – after Ichiro Ozawa, an influential member of the governing Democratic party of Japan [DPJ], indicated he would not support the early favourite, Seiji Maehara. In a televised speech to party members, Kan said he was confident he had achieved his aims as leader after seeing the final two of three key pieces of legislation pass through the opposition-controlled upper house earlier in the day. Kan survived a no-confidence vote in June by promising to step down once the bills – which will finance post-disaster reconstruction and promote renewable energy – had been approved. \"Under these severe circumstances I feel I have done everything I had to do,\" he said. \"Now I would like you to choose someone respectable as the new prime minister.\" Party MPs will choose his successor as DPJ president on Monday. The victor is almost certain to be approved as prime minister in the DPJ-controlled lower house the following day. Maehara, who resigned as Kan's foreign minister in early March over a funding scandal, emerged as the front-runner earlier this week, but his fortunes have since receded after he apparently failed to win Ozawa's backing. Ozawa continues to wield influence over a large bloc of the DPJ's 398 MPs despite his suspension from the party over a funding scandal. He appeared to be waiting for another candidate to emerge, the Yomiuri Shimbun said. The paper suggested Maehara, a defence hawk who has warned against China's military buildup, would go into Monday's vote minus Ozawa's blessing. \"We definitely cannot trust Mr Maehara,\" the paper quoted an Ozawa ally as saying. Kan's approval ratings have plummeted amid criticism of the slow pace of the reconstruction effort and his early handling of the nuclear accident. But he will leave office having won widespread public support for his plan to phase out nuclear power – a move most of his potential rivals oppose. Aside from Maehara the list of possible candidates includes the finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the trade minister, Banri Kaieda. Whoever succeeds Kan faces a daunting list of challenges: a nuclear cleanup that could take decades, an economy in recession, a surging yen, a public debt twice the size of Japan's economy and soaring health and social security costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/aug/04/sellafield-remain-threat-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-04T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Sellafield will remain a threat to Ireland | Peter Geoghegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/04/sellafield-remain-threat-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/04/sellafield-remain-threat-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield will remain a threat to Ireland","bodyText":"Sellafield Mox nuclear fuel plant to close. It's a headline that generations of Irish environmental activists, and government ministers in Leinster House, never thought they would see. After just 10 years of operation – and at the cost of a vertiginous £1.4bn to the British taxpayer – the mixed-oxide fuel plant nestled on the edge of bucolic west Cumbria is to be decommissioned. Sellafield has long been an emotive issue in Ireland. At just 128 miles from Dublin, the plant is within spitting distance of Ireland's densely populated eastern seaboard. The Irish Sea is now the most radioactively contaminated in the world, while in the wake of 9/11 concerns about a terrorist attack on the plant briefly gripped the Irish popular imagination. Unsurprisingly then, yesterday's announcement that the Mox plant is to cease operation has been welcomed by Irish activists, many of whom have been involved in decades-long campaigns opposing the facility. However, the closure is anything but the end of Sellafield's nuclear story. Last October, the environment secretary, Chris Huhne – in a volte-face from previous Lib Dem energy policy – announced that eight new nuclear power plants are to be constructed across Britain. Only last month it was confirmed that Sellafield is to be the site of one such new reactor, to be built by 2025. It is widely expected that additional employment at the new facility will at the very least replace the 600 job losses announced yesterday. The earthquake in Japan – and the crisis at Fukushima – have radically altered nuclear priorities across Europe: Germany is to phase out all its plants by 2022, opposition to nuclear power is increasing in France and Italy. But here the only demonstrable effect is the closing of a reprocessing facility that was, from the off, run on a faulty economic model. The Mox plant was built to handle plutonium dioxide that was shipped around the world, through the Irish Sea to Cumbria, where it was to be recycled from spent fuel at the Thorp plant at Sellafield. The environmental implications, particularly in the event of a disaster, of shipping highly radioactive cargo around the world are all the obvious; the financial rationale is equally flawed. Sellafield was designed to process 120 tonnes of Mox a year: in reality it produced barely a fraction of that. In the five years since opening in 2006 just five tonnes were made, and as of yesterday the total output over its lifetime stood at a paltry 13 tonnes . The loss of Japanese contracts in the aftermath of Fukushima sounded the plant's death knell. As Irish campaigner Brian Greene, who blogs at Shut Sellafield , noted: \"From a business perspective the Mox plant has been a total failure so it's no great surprise that they are shutting it down. But the legacy is huge. It'll cost millions to decommission, the land will never be used again.\" Mox or no Mox, Sellafield will still pose an environmental threat. When the famous Calder Hall cooling towers were demolished in 2007 it took 12 weeks to remove all the asbestos from the debris. The site's radioactive legacy will last significantly longer. Meanwhile, in May, British authorities backtracked on a commitment given to Irish environment minister Phil Hogan that Sellafield would be included in European-wide stress tests of nuclear installations following Fukushima. That the plant does not generate nuclear power was adduced, rather dubiously, to explain why an examination of Sellafield's resilience against earthquakes, tsunamis, air crashes and terrorism was unnecessary. In 1981, the plant's name was changed from Windscale to Sellafield in an attempt to shift attention away from the plant's less than impressive safety record. Thirty years on it seems that, with the closing of the Mox plant, another attempted rebranding of Sellafield is underway. But unless British government policy changes quickly, future generations on both sides of the Irish Sea still face the disquieting prospect a life lived under a nuclear shadow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/17/problem-russia-syria-greenpeace-kremlin-europe-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T10:03:27Z","webTitle":"How do you solve a problem like Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/problem-russia-syria-greenpeace-kremlin-europe-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/17/problem-russia-syria-greenpeace-kremlin-europe-eu","fields":{"headline":"How do you solve a problem like Russia?","bodyText":"A resurgent Kremlin is setting the agenda on major world issues and has once again started to boss its back yard. Buoyed by his Syria diplomatic triumph, Vladimir Putin has regained some of the swagger that temporarily deserted him during protests against his re-election last year. Greenpeace activists have been put behind bars, a Dutch diplomat beaten up, and former Soviet republics hounded, with the Kremlin banning Lithuanian cheese imports for its hosting of an EU summit with eastern European states and bullying Ukraine for daring to attend. So what is the reaction to Putin's newfound foreign policy confidence in Europe's major capitals, and are they responding with one voice? France: Yves-Michel Riols and Piotr Smolar, Le Monde Ever since he arrived in the Élysée Palace last year, François Hollande has been trying to solve a conundrum: how to adopt the right stance towards Moscow. Implacable on major issues such as Syria and Iran, Russia has also conducted an aggressive policy in the parts of its backyard (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) that are tempted by European integration. Domestically, the \"vertical power\" introduced by Vladimir Putin remains largely a monopoly. Rejecting any interference in its affairs, the regime has developed an anti-western rhetoric, whether towards US imperialist designs or European tolerance of gay marriage. \"Russia systematically forces a showdown on all subjects,\" said a French foreign ministry official – an approach illustrated by the Syrian crisis. For months, Russia proved inflexible, supporting Damascus unconditionally. Then suddenly it turned around and concluded, to general surprise, a deal with the US on the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons. The episode was galling for France, which had adopted an aggressive stance towards Syria. Now, at the Quai d'Orsay, the only consolation is the foreign ministry's view that \"the Russians did not move spontaneously. They responded to threats of [military] strikes supported by France.\" But in fact, France's influence in Russia is limited. Laurent Fabius, the foreign minister, came back from a trip to Moscow in September empty-handed. \"The Syrian crisis has unveiled strong tensions between France and Russia, even if they were not publicly displayed,\" noted Thomas Gomart, Russia specialist at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI). He added: \"Since the western intervention in Libya in 2011, the Russians are very critical of the close ties between Qatar and the French political class. Moscow considers Qatar and Saudi Arabia as destabilising regimes that encourage Sunni extremism in Syria and also in the Russian Caucasus.\" Before Syria, Franco-Russian relations were generally improving. After years flailing behind Germany and Italy, France decided to copy them by emphasising the bilateral relationship. France's new ambassador to Moscow, Jean-Maurice Ripert, who studied with Hollande at the elite National College of Administration (ENA), will have a clear roadmap: continued rapprochement. Ever since the financial crisis took hold, European powers have been forced to court emerging markets more. Moscow meanwhile wants to diversify its own economy. There are mutual interests here. Once upon a time, France lagged behind in direct investment, with only its biggest companies such as Alstom and Total in Russia. Now 400 have operations there and 6,000 do business with Russia. Investment shot up to nearly €12bn in 2012. Military co-operation is intensifying. The first French-built Mistral-class helicopter carrier, the Vladivostok, will be delivered to Russia next year. The casualty of this increased co-operation is the focus on human rights. France has remained silent on the issue during the new Putin presidency. Hollande summed up the attitude towards Putin's repressive array of new laws during his first official visit to Moscow in February: \"I do not have to judge, I do not have to evaluate.\" UK: Simon Tisdall, foreign affairs columnist, the Guardian It has long been plain that Vladimir Putin, Russia's nationalist strongman, is no gentleman. Russia's increased assertiveness internationally is attributed in part to his crude, combative, take-no-prisoners attitude. But appearances can be deceptive. According to British diplomats and experts on Russia, the power and influence of both Putin and Russia, measured in political, economic and demographic terms, are steadily eroding while the EU's leverage is growing. The more noise Moscow makes, the more it seems to be striving to disguise the evidence of decline. \"The premise that Russia has become more assertive is correct,\" said Sir Andrew Wood, Britain's ambassador in Moscow from 1995 to 2000. \"Is this due to weakness or strength? Weakness, probably. There are growing problems with the economy, large internal problems and tensions. The ruling group is trying to reassert control.\" Like other British observers, Wood noted that particular Russian angst, bordering on paranoia, surrounded the expansion of the EU's Eastern Partnership. This programme seeks to strengthen ties with former Soviet republics that Russia once deemed its property. The issue will come to a head next month at a summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. It is widely expected to produce an EU association agreement, including a free trade deal, with Ukraine, and possibly with Moldova and Georgia. \"Losing Ukraine would be a massive blow to Russia. It's the most important post-Soviet state,\" said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia programme at the Chatham House thinktank in London. \"Ukraine is viewed by Putin as part of Russia. He'll ask himself, how can you be a great power if this huge appendage is lopped off? Overall, Russia is losing the battle for control of the sandwich states between Russia and the EU.\" Russia's discomfiture stems in part from the blow such defections would deliver to its own pet Customs Union project, part of Putin's grandiose plan for a Eurasian union. In a sign of distress, he imposed a partial trade embargo on Lithuania. Moscow has also reportedly offered Kiev an $8bn gas price cut if it joined the Customs Union. \"The EU has been very feeble in the past in dealing with Russia,\" said Sir Anthony Brenton, Britain's ambassador to Moscow from 2004 to 2008. \"We received zero support from our EU partners over the [Alexander] Litvinenko affair [the former KGB spy who was poisoned in London in 2006].\" That was changing, he said. \"If Ukraine wants the association agreement, and if they release Yulia Tymoshenko [the jailed opposition leader], then the EU should go ahead and also launch proceedings against Russia through the WTO [World Trade Organisation] over Lithuania.\" Brenton and other British diplomats expressed satisfaction that Germany was taking a tougher stance towards Russia after years of placing its energy supply requirements ahead of other considerations. Growing human rights concerns, and high-profile trials involving the punk group Pussy Riot and now Greenpeace, had changed attitudes. They also noted that France under François Hollande has a less cosy relationship with Moscow than in Nicolas Sarkozy's time.\"The United Kingdom has always pursued a relatively tough, robust policy,\" said Wood. \"I think we're now seeing a new realism about Russia on all sides in the EU, free of delusions about a special Washington-Moscow relationship. The EU is now the third leg.\" David Clark, chair of the independent Russia Foundation, said Britain's relations with Russia had undergone a \"mini-reset\" under the Conservative government, involving tacit agreement to draw a line under the Litvinenko affair, greater emphasis on business and commercial ties, and co-operation on matters of shared interest. One result was last week's $5.3bn BP-Rosneft oil deal. Despite this, relations remained \"in a bit of a rut\", he said. Charles Grant, director of the London-based Centre for European Reform (CER), said that while Putin's personal relationship with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, was famously bad, David Cameron was said to have developed a pragmatic working relationship with the Russian leader. Foreign ministers William Hague and Sergei Lavrov also \"got on well\" together. But such bonhomie did not prevent the hurtful sneer at last month's St Petersburg summit, attributed by some to Putin, that Britain was \"a small island that no one listens to\". Wood said the large number of Russians living in \"Londongrad\", including the so-called oligarchs and wealthy middle class who have bought football clubs, driven up property prices and competed for elite school places in fashionable areas such as Knightsbridge, was an indication of the underlying strength of the bilateral relationship. But he said last month's arrest of Greenpeace activists in the Arctic was an example of how the Russians could shoot themselves in the foot. \"Obviously this was done as a demonstration of some kind. Putin has distanced himself from it, but it is convenient for him. It's not aimed at the EU specifically, but is aimed at asserting Russia's primary role in the Arctic. \"Russians are very contradictory people. They hire people to improve their image, then they do things like Greenpeace and Pussy Riot. Maybe it makes them feel strong and powerful. But it doesn't do them any good in the outside world.\" The CER's Grant said the EU possessed other levers to counteract Russian over-assertiveness. They included Brussels' insistence that Moscow observe the EU's energy market rules, and the prospective launch by the European commission of a multi-billion dollar anti-trust case against the Russian energy giant, Gazprom. Clark said Putin continued to be motivated by fear of encirclement and the imposition on Russia of western political and civil rights agendas. His diplomatic success over Syria notwithstanding, his posture was essentially defensive. \"Russia's economic position is very fragile due its dependency on global oil prices; it is very exposed, very vulnerable. There has been no progress in modernising and diversifying, despite what Putin says,\" Clark said. Despite a contracting economy and falling popularity ratings, Putin remained a formidable opponent, Brenton said. \"Putin is very professional. He is very well briefed. He tends to go for the jugular if he sees an opportunity. He is not a diplomat. He's not the sort of guy you would invite to a tea party. But we have to do business with him.\" Germany: Daniel Brössler, Süddeutsche Zeitung Modern Germany longs for harmony – and there is no area in which this longing is this reliably satisfied better than in foreign policy. Broadly, most parties, with exception of the leftwing Die Linke, are in agreement over Germany's position in the world. No one is seriously questioning Angela Merkel's strategic combination of carefully dosed shows of strength and greatest possible avoidance of risk. Things are likely to stay that way, irrespective of the outcome of the current coalition negotiations. There's only one aspect of foreign policy where the German consensus is shattered: Russia. Germany has tradition in this respect. The comradeship between former chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Vladimir Putin during the latter's first stint as president wasn't welcomed by everyone. With Putin's return to the Kremlin, the old controversy has flared up again. Ever since, there has been a bitter battle over how to behave in relation to a Russian president who represses critics at home and attacks critics from abroad. Russia even became an issue during an election campaign which ignored the world outside Germany in every other respect: SPD chancellor candidate Peer Steinbrück accused Merkel of doing too little to get Putin to co-operate on Syria. That accusation was unfair but telling. Unfair because Merkel had tried to talk to Putin early on during the Syrian conflict and earned only ridicule from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Telling because it shows the different stances on Russia within German politics. On all sides, there has been a change in attitudes in view of Putin's calculated turn away from the west and the aggressiveness with which he tries to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet countries from the EU. But the conclusions from this shock have been different. \"Put an end to this Russia bashing,\" the SPD's former foreign policy expert Gernot Erler recently demanded. He called for more understanding of the \"frustration\" that had built up in Russia towards the west since the 90s. In Russian eyes, at least, Nato and the EU had made merciless use of Russia's weakness. This school of thought dominates in SPD circles. It sees itself in the tradition of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, calls for critics to get to grips with Russia on its own terms and warns of countering Putin's cold shoulder with a blast of frosty air. Merkel, on the other hand, has opted for polite determination in dealing with Putin, whom she has known since the start of her rule. At a discussion at the Kremlin last year, she told him that criticism shouldn't always be dismissed as \"destructive\". And when Putin recently cancelled her speech at an exhibition about looted art in St Petersburg, she immediately threatened to cut her visit short – which produced the desired effect: her speech was rescheduled. That episode shows how Merkel likes to deal with Putin. She considers it pointless, counterproductive even, to answer the Russian's provocations with passive reserve. She and her foreign policy adviser Christoph Heusgen are certainly less worried about standing up to Putin than the SPD and their foreign policy experts. If the next German government consists of a grand coalition between Merkel's party and the SPD, it is almost certain that policy towards Russia is going to be the source of conflict. This will particularly be the case if the Social Democrats claim the foreign ministry. As foreign minister in the last grand coalition, the SPD's Frank-Walter Steinmeier had pursued the same kind of strategy that he had followed when he was Gerhard Schröder's chief of staff in the chancellery. He was cautious when it came to criticising Russia's human rights abuses in public. The \"modernising partnership\" – a term coined when Steinmeier was foreign minister – lives on in language only, and has suffered from the fact that Putin's Russia only wants to equate modernisation with technological progress. Regardless of which party provides the new foreign minister, the foreign ministry has a reputation as a bastion of \"Russia empathisers\", civil servants who warn of trying Russia's patience with too many patronising lectures. A ruling coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Green party could be a more attractive option in that light. No one has been more outspoken in calling for a strong defence of human rights when dealing with Russia than the Greens. Of course, any Green foreign minister could end up suffering the same fate as his or her predecessor, Joschka Fischer. Moscow simply ignored him; instead, they went straight to Schröder and his people. And Fischer soon learnt to avoid the Russian capital altogether. Poland: Pawel Swieboda, director of Warsaw thinktank Demos Europa and guest columnist, Gazeta Wyborcza From a political point of view, Russia is no longer a factor for Poland. While sensitive issues surface from time to time, especially around the Smolensk tragedy, Russia is no longer a political reference point for Poles. But its culture remains very popular and Russia's tormented soul continues to intrigue. Russia made a strategic mistake by resisting the Atlanticist aspirations of central Europe. If at the time it had treated the changes in these countries openly and dispassionately, it could now boast genuine respect. Instead, new EU members from eastern Europe were so riled that they were dubbed the \"new warriors of the cold war\". Poland even blocked the candidacy of Paavo Lipponen as European commission president because he had advised Russian companies. Since then, a thaw of sorts. Firstly some small cross-border trade opened up with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which borders Poland. Trade with Russia itself has also increased – but on political issues Poland does not flinch. We do not want to reveal what we think of the state of Russian \"democracy\". We are shocked by Russia's Syria policy, but are quietly satisfied that Russia is so busy with Middle Eastern affairs that it pays less attention to eastern Europe. On the delicate matter of its energy dependence on Russia, Poland has finally started doing its homework. The construction of the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie has been delayed but it will be finished next year. No one in Poland would deny that the dash for shale gas is directly linked to bargaining positions vis-a-vis Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant. On the other hand, the Polish leadership shudders when it observes Russian defence policy. Poland does not understand Nato's insouciance towards Russia's military potential. Russia's army has serious shortcomings, but Russia remains a nuclear power – and an unpredictable one at that. The 2008 Georgia war may have been forgotten in the west. Not in Poland. Then there is Ukraine – a large space in which Poland and Russia have had a long strategic battle. Polish leaders sat up and took notice when the Kremlin began to pressure Kiev to renounce its ambitions to join the EU. It has long been clear that Putin's personal project is the \"Eurasian alliance\" – a cynical attempt to restore Russia's sphere of influence with the former Soviet Union. The Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, has tried so far to play it both ways at the same time, but now seems determined to sign the EU agreement. For Poland, Ukraine is a priority. Until the ink is dry on the EU pact, Warsaw will continue to work for its inclusion in Europe. What does this mean for the future? The European Union is resigned to Russia. In recent years, almost everything has been tried – trade talks, the so-called \"common spaces\". The entry of Russia into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) raised great hopes, which until now have not resulted in much. It was hoped that Russia would follow the lead of China, which used its entry into the global economic system to reform and open up. The EU has accepted that Russia will not be like it any time soon. For now, it is playing a waiting game, hoping that the changes in the world order will instil a new mood in the Kremlin. Poland is waiting too. Spain: Carmen Claudin, El País Spain seems to think that Putin's Russia is not a problem for it. Recent events that have again put Russia under the international spotlight – its role in Syria or the pressure it placed on Ukraine not to sign the new Association Agreement with the EU next November – have not earned any special attention in Madrid. Even so, and despite the signing in March 2009 of the Strategic Partnership between the two countries, there is no indication that Russia really takes Spain seriously, as a country that carries any weight within the EU. The new Concept of Russian Foreign Policy, from February 2013, where each word was carefully measured, devotes a separate paragraph to the importance of developing bilateral relations with European countries such as Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, while Spain is relegated to the category of \"other\". The military co-operation agreement signed between the two countries in July 2013 looks likely to be the most serious event in their bilateral relations. Spain rarely decouples itself from Brussels in its Russia policy. And when it does so – as with negotiations for the elimination of visas for Russian citizens in the Schengen area, or on its refusal to recognise Kosovo – it tends to lean towards Russia. Perhaps Spain will one day understand that with Russia it is not enough to simply take a friendly and uncritical approach in order for it truly consider Spain as a strategic partner. Reaching agreements is certainly important but it is not the same as making policy. Italy: Roberto Toscano, La Stampa In recent weeks, Russia has been showing strong signs of the assertiveness that has characterised the politics and the style of Vladimir Putin for some time. There is no doubt that the Russia's triumphant activism was facilitated by Barack Obama's uncertainty over Syria, after he was pushed towards a fight he did not believe in. With his diplomatic initiative on chemical weapons, Putin offered Obama a way out. But it would be a mistake to see this political victory as a one off, as the result of some talented diplomacy by a Russian leader who knew how to seize the moment. Instead, it is worth looking at recent events as the fruit of coherent political strategy by Russia and Putin, the aims of which are clear. It all starts with the humiliation that Russians feel, even anti-communist Russians, over the loss of Russia's former global influence and over the fragmentation of a state that most Russians would have preferred to see remain intact, even after the end of the Soviet Union. This was precisely the view Putin expressed in 2005, when he defined the end of the USSR as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century\". How can Russia get over this humiliation and win back the global influence that it has never ceased to consider its right? And to what degree is this ambition compatible with our interests, as European and Italians? Putin is ambitious but not a megalomaniac. He knows only too well that the bipolar world will not return and that America cannot be challenged or even counterbalanced. With great realism, Putin has realised that the only way Russia can back its interests and boost its image as a great power is through diplomacy. That is not to say Russia has stopped creating problems for the US or opposing US interests by helping America's enemies, by putting pressure on countries in the sphere of influence Russia tries to maintain (from central Asia to the Caucauses to Ukraine), even if they are formally independent, by strongly opposing US plans to set up anti-missile systems near its borders. But all these gambits are part of a bigger and more important diplomatic game, a game that Russia intends to play on a multilateral level. Proof is the text Concept of Russian Foreign Policy approved in February, in which the aims of Russian foreign policy are laid out.The UN is mentioned numerous times, as are the embryonic but dynamic multilateral initiatives that Russia is launching in Asia. Moscow is assuming there will never again be a bipolar world, while it loves to remind the US – as Putin did in his provocative editorial in the New York Times on September 11 – that its dream of a unipolar world has failed. That leaves a multipolar world in which some countries are more equal than others when it comes to organising the structure and the rules of the international system. At the start of the previously cited strategic document, there is a reference to the \"augmented responsibility of Russia in defining the international agenda and the construction of the international relations\". But isn't a multipolar world one in which the EU can seek a global role? Russia's challenge can be seen from a critical point of view by the US and Europe (not all their interests will coincide), but they should not be blindly hostile. Russia has always been seen by Italy as an extremely interesting commercial and economic partner, but it is not just about economics. If Russia switches from its proverbial \"nyet\" at the UN to a more flexible game in a bid to build influence through the UN – and not against the UN – that will favour a country such as Italy, which has a multilateral foreign policy. Russia, as shown in its strategy document, has no intention of abandoning its privileged status on the security council, but it insists on the need for a security council that is more representative, or larger. Just as Italy does. In Rome, there is a cautious but substantial optimism about Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2011/sep/23/gardeners-question-time-conflict-interests","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-23T17:21:07Z","webTitle":"Gardeners' Question Time chairman accused of conflict of interests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/23/gardeners-question-time-conflict-interests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2011/sep/23/gardeners-question-time-conflict-interests","fields":{"headline":"Gardeners' Question Time chairman accused of conflict of interests","bodyText":"The chairman of BBC's Gardeners Question Time is embroiled in a row over his support for new nuclear power stations planned close to the Lake District. Eric Robson, who will appear on Sunday in the Wainwright's Long Walk television series, is being accused of a conflict of interest by anti-nuclear protesters opposed to a second generation of plants and the possible siting of a high-level waste dump in the region. The broadcaster is chairman of the Cumbria Tourism organisation while also being involved with Osprey Communications, a PR firm working on issues surrounding a deep underground repository. \"This is a big fat conflict of interest,\" argues Marianne Birkby from local pressure group, Radioactive Free Lakeland. \"Eric Robson is both poacher and gamekeeper by acting as a PR guru for an organisation which is essentially promoting steps towards geological disposal while holding a position of trust for tourism and the environment. He should step down from Cumbria Tourism,\" she added. The debate around the future of nuclear in the Cumbria area which is already home to the giant Sellafield atomic complex heated up with the release of a new draft consultation document on high level radioactive waste burial. The issue was also highlighted on Friday when power company, Scottish and Southern Energy announced it was pulling out of a joint venture to build a new nuclear plant to generate electricity near Sellafield. The company said it planned to concentrate on renewable energy such as wind. It leaves Centrica, owner of British Gas, as the only UK company still in the race to build new nuclear stations. Cumbria Tourism plans to appoint a consultant who will undertake a \"brand protection\" strategy that will look into whether new nuclear plants or dumps in the region would undermine the Lake District's £2bn a year tourism industry. The head of policy, Richard Greenwood, admitted more nuclear development \"probably is not going to be a benefit.\" On Friday Robson confirmed his support for Britain to proceed with a new generation of nuclear power plants but said he had \"no settled view\" on whether there should be a high level waste dump at Sellafield on the Cumbrian coast. He strongly denied he was compromised over his work as chairman of Cumbria Tourism and his part ownership of, and work for, Osprey Communications in its role as adviser to the West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely Partnership. \"The members of Cumbria Tourism are well aware of my personal views about nuclear. They have the opportunity to replace me at every annual general meeting and have not done so. I have voiced a DVD [that Osprey did] for the partnership but I have otherwise not been involved. \"The partnership is in any case promoting democratic debate around the geological disposal of radioactive waste not taking decisions on whether to go-ahead or not. I can't see how that can be wrong.\" But Radioactive Free Lakeland and others environmental groups see the partnership as a government-inspired vehicle for hastening the introduction of a high level waste dump. They are convinced that ministers believe they can only proceed with new nuclear as long as they are seen to be taking steps to deal with a toxic historic legacy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/29/iran-nuclear-scientist-bomb-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-29T09:02:00Z","webTitle":"Iranian nuclear scientist killed in bomb attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/29/iran-nuclear-scientist-bomb-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/29/iran-nuclear-scientist-bomb-attack","fields":{"headline":"Iranian nuclear scientist killed in bomb attack","bodyText":"Bomb attacks have killed a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist and wounded another in Tehran, state TV reported today. Attackers riding on motorcycles attached the bombs to the car windows of the scientists as they were driving to their workplaces this morning, the station's website said. One bomb killed Majid Shahriari, a member of the nuclear engineering faculty at the Shahid Beheshti University, in Tehran. His wife, who was in the car with him, was wounded. The second blast seriously wounded the nuclear physicist Fereidoun Abbasi,52, also a professor at Shahid Besheshti University, and his wife. Confusion surrounded reports of a third explosion. Javanonline, a newspaper website close to the Revolutionary Guards reported that another explosion in Tehran killed two people but semi-official news agency Fars published an interview with Tehran's chief of police insisting there had only been two blasts. State TV swiftly blamed Israel for the attacks. The attackers were described as \"unknown terrorists\" by Press TV, the English language news network controlled by the Iranian government. Fars reported: \"American and the Zionist regime's agents carried out two assassinations against two basiji professors of Shahid Beheshti university, one has been martyred and the other one has been severely injured along with his wife.\" The Basij militia is a voluntary force supervised by the Revolutionary Guards. At least one other Iranian nuclear scientist has been killed in recent years, in an attack similar to today's. Iran has said it suspects the attacks were part of a covert attempt by the west to undermine the country's nuclear programme. A pro-government website, mashreghnews.ir, said Abbasi held a PhD in nuclear physics and a laser expert at Iran's defence ministry. He was one of only a few top Iranian specialists in nuclear isotope separation, the site said. It added that Abbasi had long been a member of the Revolutionary Guard, the country's most powerful military force. He was also a lecturer at Imam Hossein University, which is affiliated to the Revolutionary Guard. Mashreghnews.ir reported: \"Dr Fereydoun Abbasi's name was mentioned in UN security council 1737 resolution as a person linked to Iran's nuclear activities and this shows they [Americans and Israelis] were planning to assassinate him from [a] long time ago.\" The website said Shahriari was an expert in elementary particle physics and had designed \"the new generation of theoretical nuclear reactors\". Both scientists were members of the central committee of Iran's nuclear association. Some Iranian media reported Abbasi as having died after he was transferred to hospital but the Mehr news agency said he had been released from hospital and was in good shape and health. The attacks bore close similarities to another, in January, that killed the Tehran University professor Masoud Ali Mohammadi, a senior physics tutor. He died when a motorcycle fitted with a bomb exploded near his car as he was about to leave for work. The attacks came as the leak of more than 250,000 classified cables from US embassies revealed that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has repeatedly urged the United States to destroy Iran's nuclear programme. Iran maintains that its atomic programme is designed to supply power stations rather than to build nuclear warheads. A fresh round of talks with the five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany, is due to begin on 5 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/21/ftse-rally-vodafone-up","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T09:47:02Z","webTitle":"FTSE rally continues as Vodafone leads the way after AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/21/ftse-rally-vodafone-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/21/ftse-rally-vodafone-up","fields":{"headline":"FTSE rally continues as Vodafone leads the way after AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal","bodyText":"Leading shares are continuing the rally that began at the end of last week, on merger news and hopes that Japan was coming to grips with the problems at its nuclear power plants. But the optimism was tempered by the situation in Libya, with the weekend's air attacks seemingly causing concern to the West's Arab allies, and fears of supply problems pushing up the oil price more than $1 to $115. Asian markets moved higher overnight - although the Nikkei was closed for a holiday - and helped push the FTSE 100 up 64.48 points to 5782.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open more than 100 points better. Vodafone was the leading rising in the FTSE 100, up 6.8p to 176.75p in the wake of the weekend's news that AT&amp;T had agreed to pay £24bn for T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom. The move led to renewed speculation of a merger between Vodafone and its US partner Verizon. Investec analysts said: For Vodafone the US consolidation is relatively good news, in our view. The consolidation of the US mobile space will be of benefit to 45%-owned Verizon Wireless. It basically sidelines its major US competitors in a focus on integration and synergy extraction...a process that we have seen in Everything Everywhere does not normally benefit near-term operational performance. The deal does reduce Vodafone's potential moves in the US (T-Mobile and/or AT&amp;T would have made the most likely bedfellows if Vodafone were to have gone down the path of relinquishing its Verizon Wireless position)...but it also makes the potential for a Verizon-Vodafone merger deal a little more likely, in our view (in keeping with seemingly warming, or at least thawing, relations between the two). But Investec reckoned the deal was bad news for Inmarsat, down 9.5p at 567.5p, because it could cause problems for the satellite group's US partner Lightsquared. Investec said: An AT&amp;T/T-Mobile deal ... makes the likelihood of the Phase 2 extension to the Lightsquared deal a little less likely (we don't include any of this in our valuation anyway). The deal is for an effective purchase of Inmarsat Spectrum into perpetuity for $115m per annum...it would be worth around 150p per Inmarsat share. Lightsquared is a wholesale 4G network to be built across the US. It requires some deals with the network operators to become legitimately viable. T-Mobile has often been viewed as one of its key targets for such deals, so its potential merger with AT&amp;T is a blow for Lightsquared. This does not blow Lighsquared out of the water, but it does make it harder, and perhaps longer term for it to prove its case to a sceptical market. Elsewhere Essar Energy, the India-focused power group, fell 23.9p to 451.1p despite an 8% rise in 2010 earnings beating market expectations. UK power companies have slipped back after regulator Ofgem ordered them to simplify pricing or face a competition commission enquiry. British Gas-owner Centrica, which also announced the £55m acquisition of New York group Gateway Energy Services, has lost 1.9p to 326.6p, while Scottish and Southern Energy is down 5p at £12.29. Weir has climbed 60p to £16.95 following an upgrade on the engineering group from Credit Suisse. The bank has moved from neutral to outperform with an £18.35 price target and said: With Weir underperforming the sector by 5% over the last three months, we see the current share price as a good re-entry point into what remains a strong organic growth story. It said recent strong order intake should underpin revenue growth of 16% in 2011, while the company also had acquisition headroom of more than £650m, which gave it plenty of scope for earnings enhancing deals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/nov/02/morocco-solar-farm-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-02T13:40:10Z","webTitle":"Morocco to host first solar farm in €400bn renewables network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/morocco-solar-farm-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/nov/02/morocco-solar-farm-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Morocco to host first solar farm in €400bn renewables network","bodyText":"Morocco has been chosen as the first location for a German-led, €400bn project to build a vast network of solar and windfarms across North Africa and the Middle East to provide 15% of Europe's electricity supply by 2050. The Desertec Industrial Initiative (DII), a coalition of companies including E.ON, Siemens, Munich Re and Deutsche Bank, announced at its annual conference being held in Cairo on Wednesday that \"all systems are go in Morocco\", with construction of the first phase of a 500MW solar farm scheduled to start next year. The precise location of the €2bn plant is yet to be finalised, but it is expected to be built near the desert city of Ouarzazate. It will use parabolic mirrors to generate heat for conventional steam turbines, as opposed to the photovoltaic cells used in the UK. The 12 square kilometre Moroccan solar farm will, said Paul van Son, Dii's chief executive, be a \"reference project\" to prove to investors and policy makers in both Europe and the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region that the Desertec vision is not a dream-like mirage, but one that can be a major source of renewable electricity in the decades ahead. Van Son described Desertec as a \"win-win\" for both Europe and MENA, adding that the Arab spring had created both opportunities and \"questions\" for the ambitious project. Discussions are already underway with the Tunisian government about building a solar farm, he said, and Algeria is the next \"obvious\" country, due to its close proximity to western Europe's grid. Countries such as Libya, Egypt, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia are predicted to start joining the network from 2020, as a network of high voltage direct current cables are built and extended across the wider region. German companies and policymakers have dominated the Dii conference, reflecting the nation's recent decision to totally phase out nuclear power by 2022 in reaction, in part, to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in March. By comparison, not a single representative from the UK was at the conference. Jochen Homann, the state secretary at Germany's Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology, told the conference: \"We undertook major reforms in German energy policy this summer and Desertec opens up an opportunity for us. We want to enter the age of renewables with sustainable sources of electricity supplying 80% of our power generation by 2050. As we accelerate our phase-out of nuclear power, we need to safeguard an affordable supply of electricity and we will be interested in importing renewables supplies in the future. Germany's government will continue to support Desertec. It is an inspiring vision which is good for foreign, climate and economic policies.\" But Homann stressed there would be \"pre-conditions\" for guaranteeing long-term support from the Germany government. He said there must be \"liberalisation\" of the energy markets across the MENA region: \"North Africa still provides huge subsidies for fossil fuels. There will need to be regulatory improvements. Only then will renewables be able to compete and a common market created. And other European states must participate, too.\" Hassan Younes, Egypt's minister of electricity and energy, told the conference that Egypt was keen to participate and that it hoped to have a 1,000MW windfarm built by 2016 in the Gulf of Suez, adding to the 150MW \"hybrid\" gas-solar power plant that opened 100km south of Cairo earlier this year. The conference was told via a Dii promotional video that the network of solar and windfarms across the MENA region would help to \"halt migration\" into Europe, by fast-tracking the rise of the region's youthful population out of poverty and unemployment. The Desertec plan was welcomed by many in Germany, including chancellor Angela Merkel. However, some German critics argued that the concept of transmitting solar power from Africa to Europe was not proven and that a billion dollar project does not fit in to the country's green energy plan.

Accepting the 2011 International Catalunya prize, the Japanese novelist said in his speech that the situation at the Fukushima plant was \"the second major nuclear detriment that the Japanese people have experienced\", the Japan Times reported. \"However, this time it was not a bomb being dropped upon us, but a mistake committed by our very own hands.\" The Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power, he said, after having \"learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha [survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war] just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing\". But instead, \"those who questioned (the safety of) nuclear power were marginalised as being 'unrealistic dreamers,'\" said Murakami, with priority put on \"efficiency\" and \"convenience\" by the government and utility companies. Instead, the bestselling author of Norwegian Wood and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle suggested, the country should have worked to develop alternatives to nuclear power as a way to take collective responsibility for the victims of the atomic bombs. Murakami is donating his €80,000 winnings from the award to the victims of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, and to those affected by the nuclear crisis. The novelist said he was confident his country would \"rise again to rebuild after realigning its mind and spirit, just as it has survived on many occasions throughout its history\", according to the Mainichi Daily News. \"We must not be afraid to dream,\" he said. \"Do not be caught up by the evil dogs that carry the names of 'efficiency' and 'convenience'.

Now researchers have developed a soft, flexible robot prototype inspired by starfish, worms and squid that overcomes some of the limitations of inflexible robots like Robbie. Robots have come a long way in the past 50 years, demonstrating a range of impressive skills such as climbing stairs, dancing and playing the violin. Yet most are still made of rigid metallic rods, joints, bearings and motors, which makes them unstable on uneven surfaces and limits their ability to negotiate obstacles. George Whitesides of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and colleagues have created a pneumatically driven robot made of flexible polymers to address these limitations. \"I could see soft robots being especially useful for tasks where you use fingers, like surgery, or in which delicate objects such as raw eggs are being manipulated,\" said Prof Whitesides. \"They have a low centre of gravity and so should also be more stable. Also in hazardous locations such as a nuclear power plant like Fukushima after an accident, there might be instances in which a wheeled robot would be no good if there are piles of rubble about.\" To move about, the prototype robot uses a series of small, inflatable chambers embedded within each of its four legs and its central spine. These chambers are contained within a rubbery polymer layer but bonded to a non-flexible layer so that inflating them bends the robot's skin. The robot, measuring 18cm across, is programmed to inflate different chambers in specific sequences to move forward, lifting one leg off the ground while leaving the other three planted to maintain stability. Prof Whitesides's group used different sequences to demonstrate various gaits and to show off the robot's ability to crawl under a glass plate suspended 2cm above the ground in less than a minute. The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/17/fracking-green-groups-denounce-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-17T09:10:07Z","webTitle":"Fracking: green groups denounce report approving further exploration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/17/fracking-green-groups-denounce-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/17/fracking-green-groups-denounce-report","fields":{"headline":"Fracking: green groups denounce report approving further exploration","bodyText":"Campaigners reacted angrily on Tuesday to the recommendation by government advisers that \"fracking\" for shale gas can resume in the UK, despite reassurances that the controversial technique is safe. In a report published today, experts said fracking could resume with stronger controls after it was halted last year following two earthquakes near Blackpool after the drilling of two sites in Lancashire by Cuadrilla Resources. The \"fracking\" process, hydraulic fracturing, involves a well being drilled hundreds of metres deep and pumped full of water, sand and chemicals in order to release methane gas. But green groups and local anti-fracking groups angrily denounced the report. Former Friends of the Earth director Tony Juniper said this morning that it cast \"grave doubt\" on the government's commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. A study by Cornell University last year predicted its impact on climate change would be worse than coal. Elsie Walker, an activist from the Frack Off group that has staged protests at Cuadrilla rigs and fracking conferences in London, said: \"This report is a seriously dangerous distraction. People need to understand that the wave of unconventional gas development that is threatening the British Isles will bring with it far greater consequences than a number of small earthquakes.\" She added: \"Even within the narrow context of earthquakes, this report misses all the real issues such as sub-surface damage to wells causing them to leak, the much larger earthquakes seen in the US as a result of wide spread shale gas development and the potential effects on sensitive infrastructure like nuclear power stations and railway lines.\" Vanessa Vine, a resident in the Sussex village of Balcombe where Cuadrilla has a licence to frack and a spokeswoman for the No Fracking in Sussex group, told the Guardian: \"The British people need to be extremely concerned that our legislators and advisers … have allowed themselves to be so blatantly manipulated by Cuadrilla and the rest of the invading international shale gas industry. It simply beggars belief that they try to mollify us with risible reassurances that the earthquakes - which they acknowledge that they will continue to cause - are not likely to cause any 'significant' damage. Just how credulous do they think the British people are?\" But experts, including one of the report's authors, Brian Baptie of the British Geological Survey, said there was only a \"very small\" risk of damage from earthquakes caused by fracking. \"Even in a low seismic country like the UK, we get roughly 16 earthquakes [like these ones caused by fracking] in the UK each year … We think the maximum magnitude that might occur could be around magnitude three. That's based on the analogy with coal mining, and there's a long history of coal mining earthquakes over previous decades and the largest of those had a magnitude of three.\" He added that while earthquakes of that size could cause some minor superficial damage, they would not cause structural damage. Richard Moorman, chief executive of Tamboran Resources, which has a licence to frack in Northern Ireland, said the process was \"perfectly safe if properly regulated.\" Simon Moore, a research fellow at the Policy Exchange thinktank, told the Guardian: \"The report takes a pragmatic step in allowing us to establish the real potential of shale gas in the UK. At the same time, it is crucial that we have an energy policy framework that is able to take advantage of shale gas's potential, or that of any new technology, without sacrificing important climate goals. This means a credible, longer-term, EU-wide cap on emissions and maintaining Britain's flexible electricity market.\" A report earlier this year for Ofgem by management consultants Poyry suggested shale gas from techniques such as fracking was likely to only provide 1-4% of UK gas by 2020. It also said local objections could hamper its uptake. \"The unconventional gas reserves could be significant in terms of maintaining indigenous supplies. However, there are a number of issues that might prevent a US-style shale gas revolution from taking place. Not least of those issues is how Nimbyism might generate a lack of public support for onshore drilling activities.\" A decision on whether to allow Cuadrilla to continue fracking is due by the government in six weeks' time, with ministers expected to green light it. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"No decision has been taken on whether to allow fracking to resume at Cuadrilla's sites in Lancashire. We are grateful to the authors of the report and have launched a call for evidence to give people a chance to express their views on the report. Responses to the call for evidence will be carefully considered before ministers make a final decision.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/may/25/geek-manifesto-mark-henderson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-25T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Geek Manifesto by Mark Henderson – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/geek-manifesto-mark-henderson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/may/25/geek-manifesto-mark-henderson-review","fields":{"headline":"The Geek Manifesto by Mark Henderson – review","bodyText":"In 2009, I went to the Penderel's Oak pub near London's high court to address a meeting in defence of Simon Singh. The evening was gloomy and so was my mood. Anyone familiar with public speaking will know that even if a British audience agrees with you, it does so in a spirit of weary resignation. Other countries have revolutionaries. We have grumblers. \"It's a bad business, but what can we do?\" should be our nation's motto. But not at the Penderel's Oak. The audience was composed of bloggers and scientists from the \"skeptic\" movement (always spelt with \"k\"). Mr Justice Eady, a judge who is not at ease with the freedoms of open societies, to put the case against him mildly, had infuriated them by allowing chiropractic therapists to sue Singh for saying that their \"alternative remedies\" were bogus and on occasion dangerous. In the lawyers' kleptocracy that is modern Britain, the action might have cost the science writer £1m. Something must be done, they roared, and they did it. Emboldened by their support, Singh fought for his right to warn about dangers to public health and won. The skeptics used their net skills to track down chiropractic therapists who were falsely implying that they could cure childhood ailments. By the time they had finished, the authorities were investigating one in four of Britain's back-bashers. Supposedly feeble nerds launched a movement for libel reform and made it the most dynamic free speech campaign since the battle to overturn the ban on Lady Chatterley's Lover. In short, they turned the defence of the scientific method into a novel and welcome political force. British skepticism has its entertainers – Dara O'Briain, Tim Minchin, Robin Ince and Dave Gorman – who are not just comics, but persuasive proponents of Enlightenment values. It has a star in Brian Cox and a hero in Simon Singh. Now it has a political programme, The Geek Manifesto by Mark Henderson, a former science editor of the Times. I do not mean to disparage him when I say that he has produced a pamphlet rather than a book that will last. His writing is urgent and for today. He warns that our scientific illiteracy hobbles our chances of finding economic recovery and policy-making that rises above the calamitous. Of Britain's 650 MPs, only one is a research scientist – 158 have a background in business, 90 were political advisers and 86 lawyers. I could take a cheap shot on the lines of: \"Is it any wonder we are so misgoverned?\", but journalists have no right to adopt a superior tone. The British media, including supposedly serious newspapers and broadcasters, have propagated every variety of pseudo-science. Their excuse for airing the outlandish view that, say, MMR jabs cause autism is that they are seeking \"balance,\" as if there is a middle way between the tested and the spurious; as if you can announce: \"Some people say two plus two equals four, others that it equals five. The truth as ever lies somewhere in between, so let us say it is four and a half.\" Henderson is close to despair when he examines the number of students studying science in England and Wales. There are so few of them we do not have enough graduates to supply qualified maths, physics and chemistry teachers to inspire the next generation. We are stuck in permanent intellectual decline and I would, if I could, force every politician in the land to read this book and act on Henderson's conclusion that we need to abolish A-levels and introduce a baccalaureate system that would compel sixth formers to take at least one science subject. What would happen then is a question Henderson does not pose. He says that to ask where a culture that respected science would lead is to miss the point. Science is about means, not ends. If we wanted to improve public life, we would insist that the state pilot-tested policies before implementing them. What policies the testing would lead to is not his foremost concern. Yet Henderson is not quite as detached as he seems. Like any other political campaigner, he has enemies to confront. He is infuriated that Britain's rulers plaster the country with warnings about threats to health and safety, but allow alternative health practitioners to peddle quack remedies that do not tell the patient they cannot work. He admonishes the greens for their superstitious refusal to allow GM food and nuclear power, and the greens' cousins among the climate-change deniers, who cannot accept restrictions on carbon fuels that affront their prejudices. But he will not touch religion, the greatest source of evidence-denying quackery in the world. Nor in my experience – I am a patron of Westminster Skeptics – does the wider skeptic movement. Women may have their rights denied because of medieval doctrines, divinely ordained homophobes and racists may indoctrinate the credulous, but the majority of skeptics remain in our timid liberal consensus – as frightened of religion as the Victorians were of sex. Henderson begins by quoting Bertrand Russell's optimistic view that \"a habit of basing convictions on evidence… would, if it became general, cure most of the ills from which this world is suffering\". I am sure that the dogged old atheist would find much to admire in The Geek Manifesto. But he might also detect a faint whiff of intellectual cowardice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2011/aug/10/german-nuclear-shutdown-forces-eon-to-axe-11000-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-10T17:01:07Z","webTitle":"German nuclear shutdown forces E.ON to axe 11,000 staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/10/german-nuclear-shutdown-forces-eon-to-axe-11000-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/aug/10/german-nuclear-shutdown-forces-eon-to-axe-11000-jobs","fields":{"headline":"German nuclear shutdown forces E.ON to cut 11,000 staff","bodyText":"The financial effects of the Fukushima nuclear power crisis continued on Wednesday as Germany's E.ON announced that plans by its government to shut the country's reactors in response to the Japanese disaster would result in up to 11,000 job losses. As fears mounted that the nuclear shutdown would significantly increase Germany's industrial operating costs – weakening its competitiveness in an already fragile global economy – E.ON announced a swing into the red, a dividend cut, the redundancies and profits warnings for the next three years. Germany's biggest utility, which on Friday announced an average 15% price rise for its five million domestic UK gas and electricity customers, took a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) charge relating to plant closures and a new tax on spent nuclear fuel rods, pushing the group to its first quarterly loss in 10 years – a second-quarter deficit of €1.49bn. E.ON was reporting a day after German rival RWE reported its own swing into deficit, reporting that €900m of decommissioning and tax costs dragged it to a €229m loss. This week's utility results are adding to concerns about the cost of closing all 17 of Germany's nuclear reactors by 2022 and making up the shortfall by doubling renewable energy output. The German government finalised a package of bills in July that will phase out nuclear power plants which generated 23% of the country's total energy use last year, while increasing renewable output from 17% of power consumption to 35%. The move overturned Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in September last year to extend the life of existing nuclear plants into the 2030s. It will turn Germany from a net exporter of energy to a net importer, making its economy less independent. Opponents have warned that decommissioning nuclear plants and investing in renewable technologies will cost billions of euros, prompting an increase in Germany's already high energy prices. Furthermore, renewable energy generation can be intermittent, making it less reliable than fossil fuels and prompting fears of blackouts damaging to industry. Christian Schulz, senior European economist at Berenberg Bank, said estimates suggested the nuclear shutdown would increase Germany's energy bill by a fifth, which will hit the country especially hard since its economy relies heavily on its energy-intensive manufacturing industry to propel growth. Manufacturing accounts for a quarter of the German economy, compared with 15% of Britain's. \"This is very significant for the German economy, particularly in energy intensive industries such as steel production, chemicals and carmaking. As a proportion of its overall economy, you could say that this move is 50% more important than it would be in Britain, because of Germany's reliance on manufacturing,\" Schulz said. Bayer, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals firm, warned at the weekend that the country's electricity costs, already the highest in the EU, were making the country unattractive for the chemicals industry. \"It is important that we remain competitive. Otherwise a global company like Bayer will have to consider relocating its production to countries with lower energy costs,\" said Marijn Dekkers, its chief executive. His comments came shortly after Robert Hoffmann, head of communications company 1&amp;1, complained that taxes to subsidise renewable energy sources were too high in Germany. Hoffman said he was looking at locations where \"green electricity exists without the extra costs\". German households pay twice as much for power than in France, where 80% of energy is generated by nuclear plants. Klaus Abberger, senior economist at the Ifo institute for economic research at the University of Munich, said energy prices had already gone up since plans to end nuclear power generation and would stay at high for at least the next five years. E.ON in effect issued three profits warnings as the company reduced its net profit forecast for this year by 30% to about €3.35bn and said it expected \"results in 2012-2014 to be on a much lower level than 2010\" as a result of the overhaul of the power generation industry. The company cut its full-year dividend target by 23% to €1 a share and announced plans to cut as much as % of its global workforce, mostly in administration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/nov/16/government-apologises-nuclear-workers-body-parts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-16T19:51:07Z","webTitle":"Government apologises over removal of body parts from ex-nuclear workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/16/government-apologises-nuclear-workers-body-parts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/nov/16/government-apologises-nuclear-workers-body-parts","fields":{"headline":"Government apologises over removal of body parts from ex-nuclear workers","bodyText":"The removal of organs and other tissues from the bodies of 76 former workers at nuclear plants over a 30-year period that began in the 1960s should not have happened and was the result of \"unacceptable working practices\" in the NHS, the coroners service and the nuclear industry, the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, said yesterday. Speaking in the Commons to launch the report that followed a three-year inquiry into the affair, Huhne confirmed that families' views had not always been obtained before organs had been taken, as required under the law. He offered assurances that the many concerns raised over organ retention for research had been addressed by changes to the law. The inquiry, led by Michael Redfern QC, was ordered in 2007 by the then trade and industry secretary Alistair Darling, when it emerged that organs had been removed from former workers from the nuclear facility at Sellafield, some without the permission of relatives. It was initially set up to look at post-mortems carried out on former workers between 1962 and 1991, but was later extended to cover former workers at nuclear establishments at Harwell, Aldermaston and Springfields. Redfern also examined research studies, sponsored by the Medical Research Council, on bones taken from more than 6,000 people, many of them babies, and spanning two decades. In these cases, researchers were looking for evidence of strontium 90, a radioactive element that accumulates in bones, which scientists in the 1950s thought might be absorbed in harmful amounts through the atmosphere or the food chain. The inquiry found that organs from 64 former Sellafield workers were removed by pathologists for analysis between 1960 and 1991. In addition, organs taken from 12 workers at other nuclear sites were analysed at, or at the request of, Sellafield. The inquiry also found evidence of other individuals whose organs were analysed at Sellafield. Tissue removed and retained for research included that taken from livers, lungs, vertebrae, ribs, lymph nodes, spleens, kidneys, femurs, testes, brains, hearts and tongues. \"The organs were actually removed from the body by the pathologist or a mortuary technician,\" Redfern said. \"No payment was made.\" Research on the tissue was carried out openly by doctors at Sellafield, and the results were presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. The central issue under consideration by Redfern was whether the studies carried out on the tissues was legal. According to the Human Tissue Act of 1961, pathologists were allowed to take organ and tissue samples as long as they had no reason to believe that the deceased person had not objected to this use when alive, or that any surviving relatives had not objected. Permission was not explicitly needed, only a lack of objection. In 2004, after an inquiry into the scandal at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where organs and other tissues were removed from hundreds of infants without adequate permission, the law was changed to require doctors to expressly ask for permission from relatives before retaining organs for research. \"The report finds that there was a lack of ethical consideration of the implications of the research work the industry was doing, that there was limited supervision undertaken, and that relationships between pathologists, coroners and the Sellafield medical officers became too close,\" Huhne said. In a statement issued today, Redfern said coroners had made several mistakes, including not communicating with the families of the deceased and failing to explain why a post mortem had been ordered or what it would entail. \"There is no time limit on grief, nor on apologies,\" Huhne said. \"I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt regret, and to apologise to the families and relatives of those involved. \"I hope that the publication of today's report goes some way toward providing the closure they deserve. The events described in the inquiry should never have happened in the first place. \"We have learned the lessons of the past. The law on human tissue has been reviewed, and there is now a rigorous regulatory system in place, in which both the public and professionals have confidence.\" Mike Clancy, the deputy general secretary of the nuclear union Prospect, said historic errors of judgment had been made, but that the Redfern inquiry provided safeguards against any repetition. \"Nobody would question the value of medical research into potential health risks to the industry's employees and close neighbours,\" he said. \"Such research is clearly in the public interest and there is nothing remotely sinister about it. But that does not in any way justify the removal of tissue without appropriate consent.\" Peter Furness, the president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said: \"We believe that the work was undertaken in good faith, in the understanding that it was work with potential to benefit the population of the UK as a whole. \"The report acknowledges that it was not done in secret and it helped to improve radiation protection procedures. It took place many years ago, when today's standards and procedures were not in place. \"Nevertheless, we fully acknowledge that post-mortem tissue should not have been removed in this way. We deeply regret that the discovery that tissue was removed without knowledge or consent has caused distress to the bereaved.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-power-stations-report-weightman-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-18T10:37:01Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear industry gets green light from government inspector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-power-stations-report-weightman-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-power-stations-report-weightman-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear industry gets green light from government inspector","bodyText":"The UK does not need to curtail the operation of nuclear power stations after the crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan, the nuclear chief inspector, Mike Weightman, said today. In an interim report on the lessons that could be learned from the disaster, which followed a 9-magnitude earthquake and a tsunami that battered the Japanese coast, Weightman said similar natural events would not happen in the UK. He also said existing and planned nuclear power stations in this country were of a different design from those at Fukushima, which were rocked by explosions and damage to the reactors after the tsunami shut down power to the plants, knocking out their cooling facilities. Also, flooding risks were unlikely to prevent the construction of new nuclear power stations at potential development sites in the UK, all of which are on the coast, he said. The government is planning a new suite of nuclear reactors on existing sites to maintain electricity supplies and cut greenhouse gas emissions as power stations of an older generation are shut down. Weightman said there was no need to change the current strategy for siting new nuclear power plants. But he said lessons could still be learned from the nuclear accident in Japan. The executive head of the Office for Nuclear Regulation was asked by the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, to prepare a report into the implications of the nuclear crisis in Japan. His initial assessment is published today, while the final report will be produced in September. The interim report made 25 recommendations for areas to be reviewed by the government, industry and regulators, to determine whether there were any measures that could improve safety in the UK nuclear industry. Weightman said: \"The extreme natural events that preceded the accident at Fukushima – the magnitude-9 earthquake and subsequent huge tsunami – are not credible in the UK. \"We are 1,000 miles from the nearest fault line and we have safeguards in place that protect against even very remote hazards. \"Our operating and proposed future reactor designs and technology are different from the type at the Fukushima plant. \"But we are not complacent. No matter what the differences are, and how high the standards of design and subsequent operation of the nuclear facilities here in the UK, the quest for improvement must never stop,\" he said. The report found no \"gaps in scope or depth\" in the safety assessment measures for nuclear facilities in the UK, or any \"significant weaknesses\" in the UK nuclear licensing regime. It also said there would be considerable scope for lessons about human behaviour in severe accidents, which would be useful for enhancing contingency plans and training in the UK for such events. Responding to the report, Huhne said: \"Safety is and will continue to be the number-one priority. I am pleased that today's report confirms that the UK's current safety arrangements are working. \"I want regulators and the industry to work together so that we continue to improve our safety regime.\" He said the report provided the \"basis to continue to remove the barriers to nuclear new build in the UK\". \"We want to see new nuclear as part of a low-carbon energy mix going forward, provided there is no public subsidy.

But this did not stop the \"Iron Lady\" from going ahead with the deal behind their backs. The cabinet were only told of the decision to buy the original Trident C-4 system when the details of the secret deal with Jimmy Carter leaked out in the US. The 1981 cabinet papers show that John Biffen, the trade secretary, privately warned Thatcher in March not to underestimate the electoral damage the anti-nuclear movement could inflict. He correctly predicted that the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was going to be bigger than its 1950s Aldermaston heyday. The first women's peace camp was set up at Greenham Common that September and in the same month more than 250,000 people joined a national CND rally. Disclosure of the scale of cabinet opposition is revealed in a note from a 10 February Downing Street meeting at which only John Nott, her defence secretary, and Lord Carrington, her foreign secretary, were present. Nott told Thatcher a full debate on nuclear defence policy was essential \"since two-thirds of the party and two-thirds of the cabinet were opposed to the procurement of Trident. Even the chiefs of staff were not unanimous.\" Nott, who supported the decision, went on to say he believed Britain would have to buy five rather than the four submarines envisaged and the bill would double to £10bn. Carrington harboured no such doubts: \"Failure to acquire Trident would have left the French as the only nuclear power in Europe. This would be intolerable.\" If Thatcher had any qualms about not telling the cabinet about her secret deal with Carter in July 1980 to buy Trident, her cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, was quick to reassure her. In a handwritten \"secret and personal\" note he told her that when Harold Macmillan negotiated the deal in Nassau with John Kennedy to buy Polaris, the cabinet \"ratified the decision and the agreement, but played no part in arriving at the original decision or in laying down the negotiating brief\". In a separate note he reminded her that the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, did not consult the cabinet in 1974 when he ordered the Chevaline missile system. Thatcher's biographer Hugo Young said Britain's possession of an independent nuclear deterrent was the aspect of her inheritance about which she countenanced least argument."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/may/22/energy-policy-government-nuclear-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T19:30:01Z","webTitle":"British energy policy is a dark underworld of fanatics | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/22/energy-policy-government-nuclear-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/may/22/energy-policy-government-nuclear-wind","fields":{"headline":"British energy policy is a dark underworld of fanatics","bodyText":"Anyone who claims to understand energy policy is either mad or subsidised.

I trust to science and am ready to believe there is some great mathematician, some Fermat's last theorem, who can write an equation showing where energy policy should turn. I have never met him. The equation would start with the current market price of coal, gas, oil, nuclear and so-called \"renewables\". That would give simple primacy to coal and gas. The equation would then factor in such variables as security of supply, which – being imponderable – can be argued from commercial interest and prejudice. Then it would have to take account of global warming and the virtue of lower carbon emissions. At this point the demons enter. We must consider CO2 reduction through substituting gas for coal, carbon capture, nuclear investment, biomass, wind, wave, solar and tidal generation. We must consider the application of fiscal policy to gas and petrol use, to energy efficiency and house insulation. Each has a quantity attached to it and each a fanatical lobby drooling for subsidies. As for achieving a remotely significant degree of global cooling, that requires world diplomacy – which has, as yet, proved wholly elusive. Britain's contribution to cooling can only be so infinitesimal as to be little more than gesture politics, yet it is a gesture that is massively expensive. Meeting the current EU renewables directive, largely from wind, would cost some £15bn a year, or £670 a household, and involve the spoliation of swaths of upland, countryside and coast. It is calculated to save a mere 0.2% of global emissions, with negligible impact on the Earth's sea level. Yet the government wants to commit a staggering £100bn to wind farm subsidies over the next decade, almost all to rich landowners. Northamptonshire, with England's most planned wind farms per acre (and least wind), will probably have turbines visible from horizon to horizon. Will this really so impress China and India as to persuade them to change their emissions policies? It is like a primitive tribe burning its wives and treasure to awe an enemy into submission. So complex is the mathematics of these calculations that it rapidly dissolves into naked prejudice: irrational fear of nuclear, urban hatred of landscape, leftwing loathing for oil companies. Yesterday the government was forced to pretend that it is not subsidising nuclear power at all, a fuel I can support but which is ruinously expensive on present, probably exaggerated, estimates of risk. Investing in it would require massive government intervention – with consumers paying some £200 a year above the market price of electricity – almost as much as does \"free\" wind power. The energy minister, Ed Davey, squirmed on the BBC yesterday morning, a politician who could not persuade people he was doing the right thing – and was therefore probably doing the wrong one. Energy policy is a dark underworld populated by fanatics and necromancers. Read through the literature and you will learn that nuclear means tsunamis, terrorists and Frankenstein monsters, or is as harmless as a local radiology clinic. Biomass is the new dawn, or threatens half the world's forests. Wind turbines are free energy, or they tear up peat and exhaust Mongolian minerals. We face a \"peak oil\" crisis, or we do not. We face a nuclear winter, or not. We can live for ever on shale gas, or it causes earthquakes. The world is doomed anyway (James Lovelock) or not doomed at all (Nigel Lawson). All Europe could be wired to the Saharan desert, or perhaps only in theory. We feel our way through this miasma by relying on gut instinct or on those we blindly trust. The public sums allotted in grants and price enhancements to green energy – with 8 million people facing fuel poverty – are so enormous they have bred an army of lobbyists clamouring to protect every programme for every resource under, and including, the sun. They pounce hysterically on any opponent of their favoured watt or therm. For my part, I must patiently await my mathematician. Until then I will never be persuaded that the beauty of the British landscape should be sacrificed for an insignificant reduction in global warming, one that is obliterated by a Chinese power station in minutes. My view is reinforced by the Welsh scientist, Sir Roger Williams, in his 2009 British Academy lecture. He remarked his \"greatest hope among renewables is of tidal power … both predictable and potentially substantial\". He supported the Severn barrage, a sacrifice of landscape preferable to putting the Cambrian mountains under wind turbines. Another trusty is Dieter Helm, Oxford professor of energy policy, who makes the seemingly obvious point that since gas is cheap and prevalent and has lower emissions than coal, the biggest carbon gain is won by a straight switch from coal to gas. As for preferring direct resources to the two most expensive energy sources, nuclear and offshore wind, that could appeal only to an institution now as befuddled and beset by lobbyists as the British Treasury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/apr/12/indonesia-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-12T12:47:19Z","webTitle":"Fukushima crisis fails to dampen Indonesia's nuclear ambitions | Gillian Terzis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/12/indonesia-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/12/indonesia-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima crisis fails to dampen Indonesia's nuclear ambitions","bodyText":"Japan has raised the level of its nuclear crisis to the same as Chernobyl 25 years ago. Yet the reverberations of the crises at Fukushima have scarcely cast a ripple in Indonesia's political quarters. Two weeks after Japan's nuclear crisis, the Indonesian government stated that it will continue to pursue an ambitious nuclear power programme of its own that will triple the country's electricity output by 2025. The most significant proposal is the planned construction of two nuclear power plants comprised of four nuclear reactors by 2022. The two plants would have a cumulative capacity of 18GW. The majority of officials have settled on a preferred location - Bangka – which sits between the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Supporters of Indonesia's nuclear bid are adamant that Bangka is far from active fault lines, thus minimising the potential for a Fukushima-style crisis. They emphasise that the technology used by Indonesia will be much more advanced than the 40-year-old reactors in Fukushima. Last week, Sri Setiawati , a deputy to the minister for technology and research, gave her assurances that out of the 10 Asean nations, Indonesia \"is the most ready to build a nuclear power plant\". Ferhat Aziz, a spokesman from the country's national nuclear agency, BATAN , says that Indonesia has the requisite expertise to go nuclear, with \"many experts who have been prepared [for a nuclear plant] for decades\" and numerous tests conducted at three research reactors in Bandung, Central Java and Banten. But a significant proportion of the Indonesia public, it seems, isn't as convinced. Plans to build a nuclear power plant in Muria in Central Java – nestled next to an inactive volcano – were eventually sidelined after vociferous protests by the local community. There has also been strident resistance from NGOs and environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace, who have consistently voiced their concerns over Indonesia's geological vulnerability - such as its ill-fated position atop the \"ring of fire\" - in addition to Indonesia's history of inefficiently coordinated responses to disaster. While Japan has demonstrated its extraordinary capacity for order and efficiency in a crisis,Indonesia's capacity to mobilise resources in an emergency is usually cuckolded by a well-entrenched preference for bureaucratic buck-passing. Then there's the pervasive culture of corruption in Indonesia. Nothing less than utmost stringency is required where nuclear power is concerned, but opponents fear a penchant for cutting corners could eclipse safety concerns. These fears are felt among some members of the country's National Energy Council (NEC), the advisory body that maps out power infrastructure in Indonesia, which has led to some members calling for the exploration of geothermal sources, hydroelectricity and biofuels before resorting to nuclear power. To its credit, the Indonesian government has recognised – with increasing urgency – the need for reform. The depletion of fossil fuels and ever-increasing oil prices means that initiatives promoting renewable energy are a necessity. Currently, ensuring a stable power supply is of foremost importance: only 65% of Indonesians have access to electricity; the government aims to increase this figure to 91% by 2019. Furthermore, blackouts in the nation's overburdened capital, Jakarta, occur with chronic frequency. This is compounded by the hucksterism of Indonesia's coal producers, who would prefer to export their product for a higher selling price to foreign markets instead of selling locally for a lower price to the state-owned electricity utility, PLN. At the heart of the problem is that the government continues to undervalue the price of electricity, which has subsequent ramifications for incentives for firms to invest in electricity infrastructure. It's a quandary that plagues many emerging economies: how does the government determine a price that ensures affordability of electricity to consumers while encouraging much-needed investment in the industry? It's not surprising, then, that advocates of nuclear power have found support in the Indonesian government, which is well aware that the only way electricity output can be stabilised and increased is if the country is self-sufficient in energy production; that is, it is no longer dependent on fossil fuels. Certainly, Indonesia is not the only developing nation with designs on developing nuclear power plants - although after Fukushima, it is certainly part of a select club. While the Philippines, Malaysia and China have temporarily halted their nuclear power plans, Vietnam - also bedeviled by the cumulative forces of increasing prosperity and unsustainable urban growth rates - is also to build a nuclear power plant. Both countries have been offered financial support from Russia to pursue nuclear power projects: Vietnam has already signed a deal with Russia to have a nuclear power plant ready by 2020. Indonesia has been more coy about committing to anything on paper, but will receive roughly $1.5m from Russia per year to jointly finance renewable energy initiatives. However, it is just as likely that all the talk of nuclear power in Indonesia will be simply that - talk. A cursory glance at Indonesia's chequered history of infrastructure projects suggests that significant movement on big capital and time-intensive proposals tends to be hamstrung by characteristically protracted decision-making processes. Indonesia is already on track to miss a target set by the government to have nuclear power online between 2015 and 2019. One member of the NEC, Herman Agustiwan, said that with a population of 240 million, nuclear option is a necessity for Indonesia as it has to \"consider [its] energy supply in the long-term ...[we] have no choice\". He may be right - but either way, one just hopes Indonesia's plans for a sustainable energy future aren't paralysed by governmental indecision. • Gillian Terzis is a freelance journalist based in Jakarta"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jan/23/tokyo-powerful-earthquake-four-years","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-23T12:18:12Z","webTitle":"Tokyo 'has 70% chance of powerful earthquake within four years'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/tokyo-powerful-earthquake-four-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jan/23/tokyo-powerful-earthquake-four-years","fields":{"headline":"Tokyo 'has 70% chance of powerful earthquake within four years'","bodyText":"Experts in Japan have warned that the chances of a powerful earthquake striking Tokyo in the next four years could be as high as 70%, a more alarming scenario for the city's 13 million people than predicted by the government. The earthquake research institute at Tokyo University said that in the worst case, a quake of magnitude 7 would hit the southern part of metropolitan Tokyo by 2016, while the chances of a similar disaster occurring within 30 years are as high as 98%. The government, by contrast, estimates the possibility of an earthquake that size striking the capital at 70% in the next three decades. The warning comes less than a year after a magnitude-9 earthquake off the country's north-east coast triggered a tsunami that left about 23,000 people dead or missing. The 11 March earthquake – the biggest in recorded history in Japan – and the tsunami that followed also triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents. Although newer buildings in Tokyo are built to withstand powerful earthquakes, a large quake in the city has the potential to cause widespread damage. According to the government, a magnitude-7.3 earthquake would kill about 5,600 people, injure 159,000 and destroy 850,000 buildings. Shinichi Sakai, an associate professor at the earthquake research institute, said that chances of a magnitude-7 earthquake striking Tokyo had increased since 11 March. \"The government, individuals and corporations should make preparations for that now,\" he said. Using data from Japan's meteorological agency, the institute said earthquakes of up to magnitude 6 had occurred five times more frequently than in normal years since the March disaster. The increased frequency has made it more likely that \"the big one\" could strike far sooner, it said. The government said the researchers had reached their more worrying conclusion because they had used a different computer model to calculate the risks. Days before the report was released, Tatsuo Hirano, the minister in charge of the recovery from the March disaster, said he was confident Tokyo could withstand a powerful quake. \"Please rest assured and don't flee Tokyo,\" he said. Hirano cited the lack of serious damage to Tokyo's buildings and transport infrastructure on 11 March as proof the city would be able to resist a large earthquake striking directly beneath or nearby. But he added that data from multiple sources suggested there was a \"high probability\" that the city and the wider Kanto region were due for a powerful earthquake. Last year's disaster caused widespread disruption to public transport in Tokyo, leaving tens of thousands of commuters stranded and unable to contact family and friends on overloaded mobile phone networks. Japan accounts for about a fifth of the world's quakes of magnitude 6 or higher. Safety standards for buildings improved after 1995, when an earthquake in Kobe killed more than 6,400 people, many of whom died in collapsed or burning buildings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/14/green-energy-investment-past-mistakes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-14T10:54:54Z","webTitle":"Green energy investment: let's not repeat past mistakes | Gordon Edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/14/green-energy-investment-past-mistakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/14/green-energy-investment-past-mistakes","fields":{"headline":"Green energy investment: let's not repeat past mistakes","bodyText":"The debate about how we replace the quarter of our electricity generation capacity shutting down over the next 10 years is a real and urgent one. Central to it is the challenge of doing so while cutting the amount of carbon dioxide the UK's power plants release into the atmosphere. A recent article in the Guardian by Guy Newey at Policy Exchange raises many important points – not least that the impact of lowering emissions on our economy should be a core consideration. Building new plant is expensive, and regardless of which option we choose to meet this short-term need, prices are going to rise. Until 2020, our options are simple: we can deploy new gas plant, or we can deploy a mixture of gas and new wind generation; these are the only technologies which can be deployed in time and in sufficient quantities. Onshore wind, as Policy Exchange recognises, is the cheapest form of low-carbon generation currently available, and its inclusion into our generation mix will displace gas generation while the wind is blowing, lowering overall demand and thus lowering gas prices – as well as emissions. Offshore wind, while more expensive, can also play this role. The amount of onshore wind we can deploy is limited by multiple planning constraints. Offshore wind is less restricted and can be deployed in greater quantities. Without it, we will be locked into higher gas demand up until the 2020s, when the Committee on Climate Change is recommending we rapidly decarbonise our electricity supply to keep us on the path to 80% cuts by 2050. Unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, are unlikely to provide much mitigation to consequential price rises. The lesson from the US is that even large quantities of shale gas present in, for example, the Bowland Shale, do not mean that significant quantities can be extracted economically. The cost of extraction rises substantially beyond a few core areas of a shale gas play. Policy Exchange's alternatives to renewables for cutting our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 depend in large part on the massive expansion of either nuclear power or carbon capture and storage. While both may form part of a future energy mix, it's not clear that in reality they will play as strong a role as Newey's recommendations require. The major utility Scottish &amp; Southern Energy has recently pulled out of a new nuclear plant project, with rumours of other utilities about to make similar decisions, while the only outstanding bidder for the government's CCS demonstration project is also rumoured to be pulling out. The economics of these technologies are not tested – no nuclear plant has been built in Britain in over 15 years, and CCS does not exist at a commercial scale anywhere in the world. In contrast, the economics of wind, both offshore and onshore, are well known. Moreover, nuclear power and CCS are certainly not market-based solutions, which Policy Exchange seem to prefer. The government's electricity market reforms provide support to all low-carbon technologies, not just renewable energy. The risk with Newey's approach is that both nuclear and CCS fail to deliver on the scale required, and in the wake of soaring gas prices we embark on a rush for offshore wind in the late 2020s – importing technology from abroad, having lost our first-mover advantage. With the prospect of over 70,000 jobs in the offshore wind industry if the UK chooses to move into the lead, this would be a lost opportunity. The UK has been here before. Our previous \"dash for gas\" in the 1990s has led to the very high increases in household bills we've observed over the past few years, as demand for gas has soared and wholesale prices have shot up. A second dash for gas could push up our bills by 52% over the next five years, according to Ofgem. Over the same period, a package of green measures would increase bills by 23%. More than that, instead of locking us into imports of gas, it would allow us to build a new domestic industry. Let's learn the lessons of our energy history. • Dr Gordon Edge is director of policy at trade association RenewableUK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/30/windfarms-bitter-fight-dividing-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-30T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"Windfarms: the bitter fight dividing the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/30/windfarms-bitter-fight-dividing-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/30/windfarms-bitter-fight-dividing-uk","fields":{"headline":"Windfarms: the bitter fight dividing the UK","bodyText":"On a sunny, blowy evening in September, a new single turbine was being unveiled in the Gloucestershire village of St Briavels. If you had been in the room, you would have been filled with optimism about the future. It wasn't that the community centre was heaving, because it wasn't, and frankly, most of the people in it were already converted (the couple behind the wind turbine, Sue and Andrew Clarke, are so committed to wind that if you ask them how they met, they will find a way to bring that back to the power routes of the National Grid). There was a local couple who'd already invested in the turbine, Norman and Mrs Fry; a few young men in a hurry; the guy from Co-operative Energy, Tom Hoines; James Greenwood, the Brideshead-ish local Green party candidate… I was struck by how sunny and dynamic they seemed, how different from the dour deep-greens that I'd free-associate with words such as \"sustainable\" and \"renewable\" and \"crowdsourced community energy project\". The Clarkes spent two decades working for multinational environmental consultancies, advising governments and large companies such as Exxon Mobil. Eventually, they simply knew too much about the future of energy supplies not to try to make a go of renewables. Which is when they set up the Resilience Centre. They've had no grant funding, and have sunk everything – time, energy, pensions – into wind. \"If we don't make this work,\" Andrew starts, \"we're going to be skint.\" \"We're skint, anyway,\" Sue says, in the brisk fashion of someone used to making stuff happen. Before I went to St Briavels, I'd concluded – from the powerful certainties of the anti-wind subsidy lobby – that, whatever else was true of it, wind energy was very expensive. But when I saw the modestly sized Great Dunkilns turbine, which can supply electricity for the whole village, for 20 years, the real value finally penetrated my thick skull. The cost argument is a red herring, based on energy markets that are set by finite fuels and yet which imagine those fuels to be infinite. Besides which, the monetary value doesn't ask any other questions, such as, \"How much does it cost the environment?\" The mood in St Briavels is powerfully optimistic. \"If we want to destroy the environment, we should destroy the bit we're living in, not somebody else's bit,\" Norman Fry says. He sounds so cheerful, using the word \"destroy\" to underline how little detriment it causes, the single, slightly surreal-looking turbine on the farm up the road. Greenwood muses: \"That thing out there powers this village. You never have to worry about another cubic metre of gas, coming from somewhere where you have to fight to get your hands on it, economically, militarily… How exciting is that?\" Tom Greatrex, the Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, points to this community model as a way out of the pro-/anti-wind deadlock: \"It's amazing the difference it makes when the people who live under it are involved and make money out of it. There's a good one in Cumbria, one in Stirling. In Gigha [in the Hebrides], they got a grid connection a couple of years ago, and most of the time they were meeting all their energy needs on their own island.\" I walked out of that squat, strip-lit hall believing that things could be different; that energy supply didn't have to be dominated by a few juggernaut, global providers, sucking money inexorably upwards to shareholders as people's bills got bigger. People could invest in their own infrastructure and reap their own rewards. Maybe we could live without feeling as though we constantly had to pit our comfort against the future of the planet, and perhaps it was possible to create a system in which a boom in Asia or an uprising in the Middle East had very little impact on electricity bills in the UK. Then I spoke to the residents of Montgomeryshire, where the community feels under siege. They talk about the plans for an expansion of grid capacity to deal with extra wind – from Scottish Power and the National Grid – in terms of sheer violence, ground gouged, landscape sliced open, fertile land out of commission for an unforeseeable time. So far, thanks to very successful opposition from Montgomeryshire Against Pylons (Map), the only change has been to the political landscape – pro‑wind candidates replaced by antis, from the county council to the MP. Jonathon Wilkinson, founder of Map, says, \"Before 2011, I had little idea about the scale of wind development in mid-Wales, and I'm in favour of renewables. I was in favour of wind. But what's proposed here is industrial in scale, it's 800 turbines to start, and we believe that once the National Grid link's in there could be 1,500 turbines. It's just wholly disproportionate.\" \"That's not really about wind,\" says Bruce Davis, co-founder of Abundance, which raises investment for green projects. \"They're just being screwed by the National Grid.\" There are options that would be less disfiguring, such as chasing the pylons underground, but Wilkinson says he's seen an underground pylon development in action, and he couldn't even countenance that, because it's so disfiguring and makes the land unworkable for such a long time. Such alternatives are unlikely to get beyond the drawing board at present anyway, because they are more expensive. \"It's called National Grid,\" Wilkinson points out, \"so everyone assumes that it's a national company, but it's an American company [see footnote] that happens to have a state monopoly in providing infrastructure for the UK. They will always choose the cheapest and easiest route they possibly can.\" (This is another great untold story of energy, that the assumptions we make of national ownership are wishful – the National Grid is American [see footnote]; E.ON and RWE npower are German; EDF are French; local electrical engineers are frequently digging up your roads on behalf of Li Ka-Shing or JP Morgan.) Pros and antis: it is disconcerting how decent they all seem. But there's apparently no middle ground, and the claims of the two camps are so wildly at odds that it's hard to conceive of what a middle ground would look like. Pros say we are the Saudi Arabia of wind; it is so blowy, we should be the envy of Europe. We should also, given our engineering and manufacturing background and potential, be making all our own turbines. Antis say windfarms destroy the environment and cause more CO2 damage than they relieve, with the infrastructure they demand, the extra roads, the turbines themselves, the peat bogs they destroy. They say (some of them) that the cost of supplementing wind energy with gas-fired generators is greater, in terms of CO2 emissions, than a gas turbine operating alone. They say windfarms kill birds and interfere with people's hearing and health. They say wind energy is pointless because you can't store it, and it always blows the most at times when nobody needs it. Vexingly, the two sides of this debate do not organise neatly along opposite straits: it's not as though the antis are fighting for the landscape, while the pros are fighting for the economy. Everyone's a conservationist; everyone's trying to secure a long-term energy future; everyone's trying to compete globally; everyone says they want to reduce energy bills. But things do organise pretty neatly along party lines and, says James Greenwood of the Green party, \"The division has got worse. Leftie liberals want wind turbines; the hard right hates them.\" Those who are anti – before you talk about where the farm will be, and how big, and how it will be funded – are against wind in principle. As Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative MP for Daventry, puts it, \"I only started looking at onshore wind because I'm a landlocked constituency. But now I have some quite big concerns about the future costs of energy, compared with our economic competitors, in affordability terms. And offshore is obviously almost twice as expensive as onshore. I'm vehemently opposed to onshore – to be quite honest, I'm probably coming round to being against wind altogether.\" Heaton-Harris is absolutely immovable on the cost of wind, and apparently cannot see the point of it at all: \"Wind energy is very expensive energy, at the end of the day. The intermittency and the inability to store the power causes all sorts of problems for the grid. When the wind blows, it's a must-take resource. Because you can never tell when it's likely to stop, and until recently it was difficult to dial down gas, it's a very inefficient way to use the gas-powered station.\" Now, this is partly true – we'll come to that in a second – but partly nuts, if only because it's unviable within his own party. Wind energy is an unavoidable element of Conservative green promises, but it is more and more understood that to be anti-wind is, like being Eurosceptic, a matter of conscience. The party can tell them how to vote, and they can vote in the opposite direction, and nobody will be kicked out. Heaton-Harris, however, was caught on camera by Greenpeace activists backing the ferociously anti-wind independent James Delingpole for the Corby byelection, against the Conservative candidate. \"Please don't tell anybody ever,\" Heaton-Harris can be heard begging the green moles. He figured it would finish him, if this got out, and we'll have to wait and see if he was right – but his hatred of wind, in the end, meant more than his party career. Undeniably, wind is intermittent – there probably isn't a country in the world that could get all of its electricity from wind, though it will help when countries have better interconnectivity, so that when it's windy in Norway, they can use the extra power in France (they're planning a European supergrid). In the UK, we hit an all-time high three weeks ago, by coincidence – at 3pm on Tuesday 6 November, 9.3% of the country's electricity use was from wind. In 2008, the National Grid said it could foresee us getting 25% of our energy from wind, with no great cost caused by its intermittency. All energy is intermittent anyway – power stations have planned and unplanned outages. Tidal energy is probably the only thing on Earth whose regularity can really be counted on. This is how it works. The entire cost of wind is the structure, so there is next to no cost at the point of use. Any wind power generated will go straight into the grid, ideally; whatever else we need will be made up with other fuels, in ascending order of expense, so basically you'll turn gas up and down according to how much wind you have. Heaton-Harris's argument is that this is so wasteful that it would be cheaper just to ignore wind and keep the gas at a constant level. It's not unlike the argument in the 90s that said you shouldn't turn your computer off at the end of the day, because powering it up and down used more energy than leaving it on all night. But many people argue that the situation calls for better technology, rather than premeditated waste. It seems to be only in the UK that people think these are good enough reasons to walk away from the idea altogether. Alexander Sewohl, from the German Wind Energy Association, says, \"We have more and more wind turbines that have to slow down because the grid is full. And we'll soon have this as an offshore problem, too – the grid capacity won't be enough until we build new grids. But our prognosis is that we'll have 25% of our electricity from wind by 2020, 47% from renewables. Most politicians know this is the future.\" Asked how Germany arrived at such harmony, Sewohl says: \"We have a strong wind industry and a good home market framework. Those are the most important things. A third is acceptance by the German people – everybody wants to get to 100% renewables, there is no more discussion about that. There is not much support for nuclear: if you look at France, they accept nuclear power and that has affected their wind industry.\" But what I think is crucial, and he doesn't dwell on, is the structure of ownership and taxation in Germany – 60% of farms are community owned (compared with 10% here). Whereas most companies are taxed in the region of their HQ, wind companies are taxed where their turbines are. Money goes into the community in rent, other companies are drawn into the area, employment goes up. People living in the shadow of the farms are those most in favour of them. It's the (local) economy, stupid. Matthew Spencer of the Green Alliance points out, mildly, \"They do have disagreement in Germany, too, you know. It's just their ruler for measuring polarisation is a lot shorter than ours\". At present, the government demands that the big six energy companies provide a certain amount of green electricity – either themselves, or by buying it from another generator. In return, they earn an ROC (Renewables Obligation Certificate). The cost of doing this – the \"subsidy\" – is passed on to their customers. Heaton-Harris argues, contentiously, that 40,000-50,000 cases of fuel poverty are attributable to subsidies on wind energy. The counterargument runs that ROCs affect only 10% of the average fuel bill. The fluctuations in the other 90% are mainly down to gas price spikes (recently caused by the Arab spring interrupting oil supply, and Fukushima setting Japan on a dash for gas). Wind does add about a tenner to an average bill, though – which is enough to tip over the edge those households already almost in fuel poverty. So the two sides manage to disagree in the most fundamental terms, without anybody being technically wrong. While there is broad public support for wind energy – a YouGov poll in October found 69% of people wanting wind energy increased or maintained – it depends very much who's asking the question, and whereabouts. Joss Garman, from Greenpeace, lays it out in this deliberate, controlled voice, as if to say, I'm prepared to be patient, but there's only so much time you people have left to understand. \"There are three questions facing Britain in terms of its energy future – how do we go low-carbon? How do we secure our supply? How do we reduce our bills?\" The answer emphatically isn't unabated gas, which, whatever its cost (pretty high at the moment, subject naturally to global undulations), is incompatible with emissions targets (by 2030, we'll be scarcely able to burn any gas and meet climate targets). George Osborne announced over the summer that he wants to make the UK a \"gas hub\"; it's not immediately clear what that means, but if it involves us using much of it, for any significant amount of time, then we will certainly have to tear up the 2008 Climate Change Act. With a backdraft of exasperation, Ed Davey, Lib Dem Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, said, \"Fifteen per cent of our energy has to be renewable by 2020. That's binding in law.\" And yet the government's line on wind remains bizarrely conditional. Abundance's Bruce Davis said in September, \"All this flip-flopping around and briefing and counterbriefing is just scaring away investment. Investors think, 'Why would we invest in a country that can't decide what it wants to do?'\" It was a remark that could have been pessimistic or prescient. Returning to Davey, I asked whether he had any anxiety about the threat posed to the energy bill by the Tory right. \"No,\" he said tersely. \"When the coalition government came into office, we were bottom of the European league for renewables. There were only two countries below us: Malta and Luxembourg. Labour had been in power for 13 years.\" (This was wishful thinking on his part – the energy announcement last week may have allayed uncertainties about the 2020 target, but it abandoned targets for 2030, effectively signalling that Osborne, and his dreams of unabated gas, were winning the argument.) When I spoke to Davey, on 2 October, he had already had a letter signed by 100 MPs – overwhelmingly Conservative – calling for an end to wind subsidies, but he was unruffled. \"When there's noises off, you can get distracted from what's going on, but we're really going somewhere. We're motoring,\" he said – an unfortunate metaphor for a good environmental policy. Then, for the rest of the month, the Conservative party went rogue. David Cameron announced, apparently on-the-hoof, that everybody should have access to the lowest energy tariffs. Some days later, John Hayes, the Conservative energy minister, declared that we had enough wind provision as we were and should stop building any more. Greenpeace sent more moles to talk to Osborne's father-in-law, Lord Howell, who claimed Osborne was positioning people in government deliberately to undermine the wind agenda. Heaton-Harris didn't help here, either, telling his moles, \"so actually Ed Davey's got the 'strategic stuff', so he can go and talk bollocks around the world, where[as] John Hayes is in charge of deployment\". And in the middle of all this, seven of the world's leading turbine manufacturers wrote to Davey to say they were \"reassessing the level of political risk in the UK\". So Davis was prescient; and really, who can blame them? We are still the Saudi Arabia of wind, but you have to imagine us as an oil-rich country with a very strong objection to the extraction of oil, for reasons that are absolutely self-evident to half our parliament and totally obscure to the other half. In a way, the coalition has been disastrous for the future of energy supplies, because it has turned the debate into soft, green Lib Dems like renewables; hard, business-minded Tories like gas. The simplicity plays to the sympathies of MPs too lazy to look any deeper, which is a dispiriting number of them; the Labour party are functionally irrelevant and the Conservatives, being more numerous, make sure gas comes out on top. But this is by no means how it had to look: the CBI is very pro-renewable, nearly a million jobs come from the low-carbon/environmental sector, the private sector invested more money in low-carbon projects than the public sector last year by a power of 10. There is no need for business and low-carbon to be ranged against one another. It's just the collateral damage in a political battle. So how expensive is wind? The simple cost was estimated by World Energy Outlook 2008 as around €60 per megawatt hour, which makes it quite similar to coal, cheaper than gas, more expensive than nuclear. It has got progressively cheaper with technology since 1987, climbing a bit in recent years as the raw materials for the turbines have got more expensive. That stuff is relatively uncontroversial. How it operates in terms of the market is where the complexity opens up to give people something to fight about. The central plank of the energy bill (well, until it turned into a novel scheme to price-cap energy bills) is to change from Renewables Obligation Certificates to a system whereby energy companies are guaranteed a minimum price for their green electricity. The minimum price for offshore wind will be higher than onshore, and nuclear will be higher than either, in all likelihood, but we won't know until the bill comes out. The system is meant to incentivise companies to build turbines or nuclear power stations (although, since the commitment to \"decarbonisation targets\" is now only until 2020, it's hard to see many companies getting excited about what will effectively amount to a five-year business plan). Jerome Guillet summed up the way different power sources work, in terms of cost, in the European Tribune: \"It is worth emphasising that 'letting the markets decide' is not a technology-neutral choice when it comes to investment in power generation: public funding (such as can be available to state-owned or municipal utilities) is cheaper than commercial fund of investment: given that different technologies have different sensitivities to the discount rate, preferred 'market' solutions will inevitably favour fuel-burning technologies, whereas public investment would tilt more towards capital-intensive technologies like wind and nuclear.\" There are a couple of points that aren't contested by anyone: first, as Matthew Spencer of the Green Alliance points out, \"For goodness sake, the energy bill should be just as much about reducing demand as it should be about creating new things to demand. We should have [subsidies] for nega-watts, the absence of energy use.\" Second, we've not talked about aesthetics, because they are so subjective, even though this is what most people who hate windfarms hate. In France, they build them along motorways, on the principle that they've already scarred the landscape. That seems like quite a good way of doing things, but of course requires a joined-up, collective agreement and forward planning that we are light years away from. Third, wind is not the only renewable, and shouldn't be invested in to the exclusion of hydro, solar and anaerobic digestion. Fourth, no fossil fuel is going to last for ever. Fifth, there is no evidence for the health problems caused by windfarms, though they do make a noise. Sixth, they do kill birds, but in tiny numbers compared with cats (who kill birds, I mean; not cats that are killed by windfarms). In the pub down the road from St Briavels, there was a small table of other people who had invested in the turbine. One, Matt Dunwell, said, \"I teach permaculture. I sell vegetables. When you talk to a lot of people, there's a patronising air: a) you're insignificant, b) that's never going to work on the main stage, and c) you're going to be trashed by multinationals anyway. This answers an energy question, it answers an investment question, it answers a resilience question. I can hold that up in the pub and say, 'This is happening in my village.'\" The parliamentary picture of diametric opposites has remained unchanged in tone since the 1980s and, from that perspective, resolution looks a long way off. But when the people in the pub support the turbine next door, there's a sense of quiet revolution, and it's hard to see what could stop it. • This article was amended on 3 December 2012.

The press release put out today makes clear the focus of the Tehran conference will be the nuclear powers and their alleged failure to carry out the disarmament part of the NPT. This is one of the talking points: Examination of nuclear doctrines and their inconsistency with the current world situation; the nuclear states regrettably continue to insist on the role of nuclear weapons in their military doctrines and, once in a while, threaten non-nuclear states with the use of such inhuman and destructive weapons. The calling of rival conferences will provide a timely test of strength between Washington and Tehran. In particular, it will be a measure of whether the US and Russia have done enough in the new START treaty, and whether Barack Obama has done enough to fulfil the disarmament promise of his Prague speech a year ago, to persuade the world's nuclear have-nots to stay away from Tehran. Iran is not invited to the Washington summit (although Israel is), and the Americans are similarly unwelcome in Tehran. The contest has started with an important win for Obama with President Hu's decision to attend the Washington summit, where the emphasis will be on ensuring stockpiles of fissile material around the world are properly secured against theft by terrorists. Meanwhile, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, has been in Beijing for a pre-arranged meeting with China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi, but Jalili's visit came hours too late to prevent China agreeing to begin negotiations in New York on a new set of UN sanctions. The Iranians have also been actively courting India and other Non Aligned Movement stalwarts. The diplomatic success of Tehran's conference will be judged on whether the likes of China, India, Brazil and South Africa show up and at what level. It will no doubt be the subject of a great deal of global arm-twisting in the coming days, with Washington and its allies warning other capitals not to allow Iran to use the disarmament cause as a pretext for diverting attention from its own NPT-compliance issues with the IAEA. For its part, Iran will be reminding sympathetic capitals of the inherent inequities of the NPT between nuclear haves and have-nots, and no doubt both sides are offering all manner of diplomatic and economic sweeteners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/23/wrong-direction-for-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-23T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Wrong direction for energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/23/wrong-direction-for-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/23/wrong-direction-for-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Wrong direction for energy policy","bodyText":"Professor Dieter Helm argues that policymakers shouldn't assume they know what the future will bring, but then says they should base policy on his assertion that cheaper gas prices will be available at least for the next couple of decades (The peak oil brigade is leading us into bad policymaking on energy, 18 October). In reality he is paddling against a tide of expert analysis warning of long-term gas price rises, particularly as demand from developing countries outstrips any new shale gas finds. The costs of nuclear power too have only increased since the Fukushima disaster. It may not fit with Dieter's world view, but if we are to bring energy bills under control in the medium term, we need to stop importing ever more expensive gas and start building \"fuel-free\" renewable energy, where costs are already falling and Britain can gain from jobs and export industry growth.

One lot simply can't wait for the day when retirement brings them release (and will rage at the thought that retirement ages are due to go up). The other dreads the day when it comes and a vacuum ensues. Those who belong in that second category will have reacted above all with envy to the news that some 200 pensioners who have volunteered to help tackle the nuclear crisis at Fukushima are confident that their wish will be granted. \"The skilled veteran corps\", they call themselves, and some restless pensioners would wish to see a similar unit established here. Many find an outlet in some kind of voluntary work, but will fret even so at the thought that skills they've acquired over 30 or 40 years must now go to waste. The one uncomfortable truth that deters them from agitating is the knowledge that, especially now, as unemployment climbs, by staying in the jobs they've long occupied or by getting selected for fresh ones they would stand in the way of young people with families and building societies to feed. But they also have to recognise a feature in the Japanese situation that mercifully will never affect them. The Fukushima volunteers are offering to carry out work they know to be dangerous, in the hope that younger workers with the same skills can be spared the dangers. Their prime mover, Yasuteru Yamada, who's 72, also points out that when you are old, malign conditions may develop more slowly. There are clear enough reasons why some are longing for what others long to avoid. Maybe it will simply reflect the kind of job in which they've developed their expertise. In some chosen callings, from deep mathematics to carrying hods, the brain or body or both are no longer so well equipped as you grow older. That judges are given a longer run than most reflects the traditional belief that age brings wisdom (an assumption that used to apply in politics, though today you can reach the top of the tree at half the age of Gladstone in his last term). Yet even judges can't go on for ever and have to be watched; in the past some remained on the bench when demonstrably senile. Still, it's clearly the case that many who now get chopped off at 65 are entirely capable of working for many years more. There's a new and subtler process too, which has recently been identified by the Time bureau chief in London, Catherine Mayer, in a book called Amortality, published last month. Since Mayer complained in a recent World Service interview that British press comment about it had sometimes simplified the thesis almost out of existence (reducing it to the level, she moaned, of \"women of 65 wearing miniskirts!\") let her speak for herself: \"Amortality – the term I coined for the burgeoning trend of living agelessly – is a product of the world many of us now inhabit, a sprawl of virtual Las Vegases, devoid of history and shorn of landmarks that might provide guidelines for what is expected of us as the years pass. Youth used to be our last hurrah before the onset of maturity and eventual dotage, each milestone – childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle age, retirement, golden years, decline – benchmarked against a series of culturally determined ideals. But as our life spans have lengthened – across the developed world, we are now living 30 years longer than we were at the beginning of the 20th century – the ages of man have started to elide.\" That's as true about working capacity as it is about lifestyle. Age, usually thought of as finite, is also relative. Nearly all of us know people whose birth certificates say they are 60 who seem in every way younger than others we know who are 40. The stereotype long since ceased to apply. How much simpler it was when the Beatles evoked an old age that set in at 64 – a life of doing the garden, digging the weeds, holidaying on the Isle of Wight when resources permitted. Paul McCartney is soon to be 69, and as with many of his coevals, that's not what he seems to be doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2009/aug/06/china-suspends-nuclear-power-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-06T09:18:50Z","webTitle":"China investigates nuclear power chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/china-suspends-nuclear-power-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/aug/06/china-suspends-nuclear-power-chief","fields":{"headline":"China investigates nuclear power chief","bodyText":"The head of China's nuclear power programme is under investigation for \"grave violations of discipline\", Chinese state media reported, citing the Communist party's top disciplinary body. There were no details of the allegations against Kang Rixin, the president and party secretary of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), but the phrasing usually indicates a corruption case. It is not clear whether the 56-year-old has been suspended from his post. The case comes as billions are spent on expanding the nuclear industry as China tries to move away from its dependence on oil and gas. The country has six nuclear power plants, all located on the east coast, and plans to build five more this year. According to its website, state-owned CNNC is the main investor and biggest owner of nuclear plants and is heavily involved in research and development. The state news agency Xinhua said the corporation had more than 100 subsidiary companies and institutes and made a profit of 4.8bn yuan (£413m) last year. Nuclear plants account for about 2% of China's power generation and the government wants that to double by 2020. Kang was elected as a member of the central party committee's discipline inspection panel – the body now investigating him – in 2002. The state council, China's cabinet, appointed him head of CNNC the following year. He is among several high-ranking officials caught up recently in disciplinary inquiries. Xu Zongheng, the mayor of Shenzhen – one of China's wealthiest cities – was fired for corruption last week.

The decision comes after a panel of experts advised that keeping the plants open was the only way of ensuring climate protection and economic goals were met and that electricity prices did not soar out of control. Merkel, who spent last week touring some of the country's 17 plants, said phasing them out by 2021 – as had been planned – was unrealistic if the country wanted to meet certain environmental goals. \"Nuclear power is desirable as a bridging technology,\" she said. Renewable energies will supply half the country's energy needs by 2050, according to the centre-right government's goals. Nuclear and coal power should continue to be central to the country's energy policy until all power supplies could be replaced by clean energy, the experts advised. Merkel's announcement, which has the backing of her coalition partner, the Free Democrats, is a heavy blow for the left. The nuclear phase-out was secured under the government of her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder of the Social Democrats (SPD), and was considered one its most significant achievements. Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the SPD, said his party was ready to launch a constitutional challenge to the extension and accused Merkel of being a pawn of the nuclear lobby. Gabriel said: \"The chancellor is selling off public safety by allowing ailing and ageing nuclear power plants to stay online longer and by taking money for it.\" He added that her plan showed her goal was clearly \"not to achieve a sustainable energy plan\". The Green party, which was part of the Schröder government when it struck the deal, announced an anti-nuclear demonstration in Berlin on Wednesday. Some politicians in favour of a nuclear extension, such as Norbert Röttgen of Merkel's Christian Democrats, said they nevertheless feared it might reduce the pressure on the energy industry to research into and develop renewable technologies. Merkel's decision is also likely to prove highly unpopular amongst the electorate. According to a recent poll, 56% of Germans are against extending the lives of nuclear power plants, citing fears of accidents and terrorism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/sep/23/ask-questions-yvette-cooper","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-23T13:45:00Z","webTitle":"You ask the ask the questions: Yvette Cooper | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/23/ask-questions-yvette-cooper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/23/ask-questions-yvette-cooper","fields":{"headline":"You ask the questions: Yvette Cooper","bodyText":"The Observer Lib Dem conference interview with Chris Huhne generated plenty of headlines.

But will we listen to them?","bodyText":"Sitting on my own in the bar of the Royal Court theatre on Wednesday with my orange juice and lightly sea-salted packet of crisps, I remembered that I was first here more than 50 years ago, as a teenager down on holiday from Scotland and determined to witness England's cultural revolution. In 1961 that still meant John Osborne, whose new play, Luther, had just opened at the Court with Albert Finney. I queued at the box office and got two tickets to stand at the back of the stalls, where my brother and I were so thrilled (so this is what the Reformation was like!) that when the play came to the Edinburgh festival later that year, I bought another ticket and stood through it all over again. The contrast between Luther and the performance I was about to see couldn't have been starker. Luther was intensely theatrical – as gorgeous as a pantomime – the stage filled sometimes with pious monks and at other times with flag-waving knights. Finney's Luther grappled loudly with his faith and his constipation, while a cynical huckster sold the weirdest of Papal indulgences. Comedy, seriousness, noise, colour and, above all, those biting monologues that were Osborne's trademark: they made for that thing called \"a wonderful night at the theatre\", but the play's message, whatever it was, would never have fitted under the rubric \"news you can use\". When you left the theatre, you stepped out of the Reformation and into the relevance of the present day. Ten Billion, on the other hand, is a piece of theatre only because it occurs in a theatre. The curtain rises on a reconstruction of a modern office; we hear the melancholy sound of a cello; a middle-aged man walks on stage, opens his laptop and begins to talk. He says he's a scientist and not an actor – that will become obvious – but that the set is a \"depressingly accurate\" reproduction of his office in Cambridge. His name is Stephen Emmott. He's head of computational science at Microsoft Research in Cambridge and professor of computational science at Oxford, and what he wants to tell us about is the future of life, particularly human life, on Earth. And for the next 75 minutes that's what he does, moving just a little around the set with the help of a stick (because a disc in his lower spine has popped out) as visuals appear on screens to illustrate what soon becomes a tide of frightening facts and predictions. Taken singly, few of these facts would be new to even the most casual Monbiot reader or the least faithful friend of the Earth, but their accumulation and the connections between them are terrifying. Rarely can a lay audience have heard their implications spelled out so clearly and informally: a global population that was 1 billion in 1800 and 4 billion in 1980 will probably have grown to 10 billion by the end of this century; the demand for food will have doubled by 2050; food production already accounts for 30% of greenhouse gases – more than manufacturing or transport; more food needs more land, especially when the food is meat; more fields mean fewer forests, which means even more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which means an even less stable climate, which means less reliable agriculture – witness the present grain crisis in the US. On and on he goes, remorselessly. It takes 3,000 litres of water to make a burger and the UK eats 10bn burgers a year. A world population of 10 billion will need 960 new dams, each of them the size of the world's largest in China's Three Gorges, plus 15,000 nuclear power stations and/or (my note-taking in the dark isn't up to his speed) 11m wind farms. The great objective of intergovernmental action, such as it is, has been to restrict the rise in average global temperature to no more than 2C, but a growing body of research suggests a warming by 6C is becoming more and more likely. In which case, Emmott says, the world will become \"a complete hellhole\" riven by conflict, famine, flood and drought. Go to a climate change conference these days, he says, and as well as all the traditional attendees there will usually be a small detachment of the forward-looking military. What's to be done? Emmott takes us through the ideas offered by \"the rational optimists\" who believe that, faced with the species' near extinction, human inventiveness will engineer a solution. Desalination plants, a new green revolution, seeding the oceans with iron filings to absorb more CO2: all of these threaten to produce as many problems as they solve. He believes the only answer is behavioural change. We need to have far fewer children and consume less. How much less? A lot less; two sheets of toilet paper rather than three, a Prius instead of a Range Rover – that kind of sacrifice won't really do it. And does he believe we're capable of making this necessarily far bigger curb on our desires? Not really. He describes himself as a rational pessimist. \"We're fucked,\" he says. If a large asteroid were on course to the Earth and we knew when and where it would hit – say France in 2022 – then every government would marshal its scientific resources to find ways of altering the asteroid's path or mitigating its damage. But there is no asteroid. The problem is us. Recently he asked one of his younger academic colleagues what he thought could be done. \"Teach my son how to use a gun,\" said the colleague. And there the performance ends. Emmott steps forward to take the applause and then the audience files down the stairs to Sloane Square, busy with taxis and young people standing on the pavement with plastic beakers of white wine, as though there would be infinite tomorrows. It isn't quite clear what we've seen – a lecture or a theatrical event – but what its ominous content most resembled, or so it seemed to me, was the kind of Protestant sermon brought about by the Reformation, in which humankind was told to repair its ways if it wanted to avoid damnation. In retrospect, this looks a relatively easy matter of regular churchgoing, refraining from obvious adultery and not doing the washing on Sundays. Light qualifications for entry to heaven compared to the levels of material renunciation needed to save the species. The speed at which our likely future has arrived is the frightening thing. How little we realised, leaving Luther in 1961, that the atmosphere's carbon content had been increasing since the industrial revolution, which you might argue was a Lutheran/Calvinist byproduct. We had our worries, of course, but the cold war and nuclear weapons didn't seem intractable threats. They produced protest rather than the fearful depression that touches some of us from time to time, when every distraction has failed. Emmott sees his performance as a wake-up call and it has apparently had that effect on its young audiences (its entire run is sold out). But it would be just as easy to see it as a well-articulated piece of despair, a scientist's soliloquy in front of the final curtain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/28/uk-bunkers-down-huge-storm-south","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-28T14:51:50Z","webTitle":"Three dead after St Jude storm lashes southern UK - live updates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/uk-bunkers-down-huge-storm-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/28/uk-bunkers-down-huge-storm-south","fields":{"headline":"Three dead after St Jude storm lashes southern UK - live updates","bodyText":"This is the latest summary: • Three people have died, hundreds of thousands of homes have been left without power and travellers suffered transport chaos after hurricane-force conditions battered Britain. • The Met Office lifted its amber warning as the heart of the storm blew away from Norfolk and over the North Sea, leaving a trail of destruction and disruption behind it. • Winds of up to 100mph had swept through the South West, South, South East, the Midlands and the East of England after first hitting land in the early hours. • Falling trees killed a man in his 50s from Harrow in north west London as he drove through Watford in Hertfordshire and a 17-year-old girl was killed as she slept in a static caravan in Hever, Kent.

Station manager Matt Burrows described the \"scene of utter devastation\" found at the scene. • A double-decker bus \"rolled over\" in Suffolk, injuring the driver and several passengers. Witnesses told police the vehicle blew over at 8am in Hadleigh, rolling on to its side and coming to a stop in a field. • In central London, Whitehall was closed both ways between Parliament Square and Horse Guards Avenue after a crane collapsed on to the roof of the Cabinet Office. • A ferry carrying 1,000 people from Newcastle to Amsterdam was forced to return to sea after the storm caused officials to close the port of IJmuiden, near Amsterdam. Here's our latest news story. This live blog will be closing now. Thanks for all your comments and pictures, and than you for reading. Following the gas explosion and toppled tre in Hounslow, the Met police have found a man in the remains of the house. A woman has also been hospitalised. A second woman is unaccounted for. Sussex police have posted this on the teenager swept out to sea yesterday evening: The search continues today, Monday 28 October, for the 14-year-old local boy who was swept out to sea from West Beach, Newhaven, at 4.15pm on Sunday. Emergency services were called to the beach after the boy had been swept away while playing at the shore with friends. An immediate and intensive search was begun involving police, Coastguard and the Newhaven in-shore lifeboat, and was only called off late in the evening after darkness had fallen and the sea became ever more dangerous. The friends were not swept off and were safe. The Coastguard will carry out further searches on Monday whenever new information is received. The Newhaven in-shore lifeboat is carrying out a further search of the shoreline and a police helicopter has been checking the shoreline for several miles each side of Newhaven. Local police officers have also been searching along the beach and helping reassure the local community. Chief Inspector Katy Woolford of Sussex Police said; \"All agencies are continuing to do everything possible to find the boy, and our thoughts are very much with the family at this time.\" If you're concerned about insurance claims and how to go about claiming for storm damage, this piece here by our consumer affairs team will help. The St Jude storm has felled the 128 year old \"tree of heaven\" at Bishop's Palace in Wells, Sommerset. Planted in 1885 the palace said the tree was a \"firm favourite, taking centre stage on the south lawn and was the backdrop to many outdoor theatre events and a favourite shady picnic spot for a lot of visitors.\" Surveying the damage head gardener James Cross said: It’s incredible to see how the base of the trunk has snapped. We’ve got a good view of a hollow interior and some rotten sections so we’re feeling relieved no-one was in the area at the time. Once we have cleared up we will plant a semi mature Tree of Heaven to replace it and it will take about 100 more years for it to grow to the size of this one. As the Tree of Heaven crashed down it sadly destroyed part of a neighbouring Mulberry Tree that was planted in 1897, so we will have to remove that too and replace it. Standing up on the ramparts and looking down at the Tree of Heaven is quite a sight and we expect many will be fascinated to see it over half-term. The clean-up will begin over the coming week – our wood shed will certainly be over-flowing with logs now. The St Jude storm appears to be wreaking a lot of havoc in the Netherlands. This video purports to be of a tree falling on a car in the northern Dutch town of Leeuwarden. This from the Press Association newswire: The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in south-west London was closed today because of damage caused by the weather. A spokeswoman said: \"Early indications are that we have lost between 10 and 15 mature trees, and a number of others have suffered loss of limbs or smaller branches. \"A dedicated team is assessing the site and we expect to be able to give an update on the full extent of the damage by the end of the day.\" Conservative MP Greg Hands has taken a cheeky swipe at Cabinet Office: Our transport correspondent also reports this: It might not be storm related per se but it a burst water main is adding to travel havoc in West London. Looks like power might be bacck on for some in Dorset A giant beachball escaped from a roof in Old Street, London around 6.45 this morning. The brightly-coloured 10 metre diameter ball was seen rolling around east London's Silicon Roundabout: The sphere was erected to mark the spot of a £200 million development by Derwent London earlier this year. There were no reports of any injuries or destruction caused by the runaway ball, but it came to an unfortunate end: Did you spot the runaway beachball?

The London Fire Brigade say that three houses have collapsed and two others have been damaged following a gas explosion on Bath Road in Hounslow in west London. Three people escaped from the properties before firefighters arrived and an elderly woman has been taken to hospital by London Ambulance. Twelve people were evacuated from surrounding properties as a precaution. Fire crews rescued a dog from one of the houses. Urban search and rescue fire crews, who are trained to deal with collapsed buildings such as those affected by major disasters like earthquakes, are working to make the area safe. Station Manager Matt Burrows, who is at the scene, said: “When I arrived on the scene I was greeted by a scene of utter devastation and three houses had been completely destroyed. Debris was scattered over an area of about 50 metres and the roof of one of the houses was in a tree across the road. “Highly trained search and rescue crews are now searching through the rubble and sniffer dogs are being used to establish whether or not there is anyone inside any of the affected homes. “We’re still investigating whether the fallen tree caused the gas explosion or whether the gas explosion caused the tree to fall. It’s likely firefighters will be on scene for much of the rest of the day. “My thoughts, and those with everyone at the London Fire Brigade, are with all of the people who have been affected by this awful incident.” Six fire engines were at the scene at the height of the incident, along with a number of specialist vehicles. There are currently (as of midday on Monday) four fire engines and over 20 firefighters at the scene. The Brigade was called at 0735 and the incident is expected to be protracted. As the storm moves to the continent, this tweet has been sent (amongst many others) from Hoorn, north Holland. My colleague Richard Adams, offers an update on events in Oxfordshire. The County council says that it had crews up at 3am this morning clearing trees, and says that it has responded to 40 incidents involving trees blocking roads. Meanwhile train services out of Oxford are still disrupted with many services canceled or delayed. Power firm EDF say that have partially shut down two nuclear reactors in Kent due to the storm. We are trying to get more information on this. \"The shutdown was weather-related. The plant reacted as it should and shut down safely,\" an EDF Energy spokeswoman said. Aviva and Direct Line insurance have said that it is too early to start estimating the potential costs of the storm but they may have some figures later today. Direct Line informs us that their emergency plans are underway as planned and they have extra staff to man phone lines. Claire Foster, spokesperson at Direct Line, comments: We take the current severe weather and flood warnings extremely seriously, and have put our emergency action plans into place. We have people on the ground and on the phones ready to help customers make a claim. Our priority is reassuring householders with Direct Line home insurance policies and getting them back in their home as quickly as possible. An update on the Whitehall crane incident. Stephen Abbott has sent us a good close up of the damage it has caused to the facade and balustrade of the building. It appears that another crane has now been brought in to salvage the first crane: This is from one of our GuardianWitness community, taken outside the yet to be completed Francis Crick Institute in Euston. More on the gas explosion in Hounslow, London Ambulance services tweet this: The BBC are reporting that a man in his 50's died after debris struck his car in Watford, North of London at 6:50am. Kent Police have also reported that after a tree fell on to a caravan at 7.18am, they attended the scene of an injured 17-year old girl but were unable to save her. This from PA: Virgin Trains advised passengers not to attempt to travel unless absolutely necessary on services on the southern end of the West Coast Main Line. Southend Airport in Essex was able to announce the resumption of flights shortly before 9.30am, while the port of Dover in Kent reopened at 9.10am, although passengers were warned to expect delays to sailings. Greater Anglia said it would not be running any trains until 12 noon. The London to Tilbury and Southend train company c2c said the power was out between Fenchurch Street station and Barking in east London, while there was a fallen tree at Upton Park in east London, overhead wires were down at Purfleet in Essex and there were obstructions on the line at Thorpe Bay and Southend in Essex. And this visual addition from the FT's deputy news editor: When you need it most - it seems many people are having difficulty with the National Rail website. The port re-opened at ten past nine. \"We are pleased to confirm that the Port of Dover is now open (at 09:10 Hours) and the ferry services have resumed,\" a spokeswoman said. Very tragically Kent police report that a 17-year-old girl died today after a tree fell onto the static home she was sleeping in at Hever. We've already had some interesting responses to our call out on GuardianWitness. Here are a few of them including a video of the Brighton sea front from our own Laura Oliver - who is currently stuck there. This from London fire services, appears to be the scene of a pretty serious event in Hounslow, west London. My colleague Richard Adams reports: The worst of the storm hit Oxford just before 6am, with Thames Valley police reporting about 20 trees downed, mostly on minor roads around the city. Meanwhile a reduced rail service has seen buses replacing trains between Oxford and Bicester. Trains to Reading and London were either canceled or delayed from around 7.30am onwards. This tweet from David Lammy MP, from Tottenham in North London. This just in from PA: Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) said more than 38,000 customers were left without power in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, while Western Power reported more than 3,800 power cuts in the same areas. My colleague Andrew Culf reports on the latest disruption in Kent: In Kent, police said the storm-force winds had brought down more than a 100 trees. They were advising motorists not to travel in the county unless necessary. There were power cuts in Maidstone and Canterbury. There was widespread travel disruption on major routes in the county: the Queen Elizabeth II bridge was closed, resulting in huge tailbacks as motorists were forced to use the Dartford Tunnel, where a contraflow system was operating. The Sheppey crossing was also shut as a precaution and winds gusting up to 60 knots forced the closure of the port of Dover around 6.30am. Southeastern trains said that it was not running trains until the tracks had been checked by National Rail. A Dartford to Cannon Street service struck debris on the line near Slade Green, while there were branches and trees on many lines. Blockages were also reported at Orpington, Sevenoaks and a telegraph pole was obstructing the line at Deal. High-speed services into London St Pancras International would remain functioning. There would also be a hourly shuttle service between Ramsgate and Deal and between Ashford International and Dover Priory. This bus in North London is a little worse for wear. For those non Brits looking in, wondering what all this \"storm\" fuss is about, it's worth noting that we have a very peculiar relationship with both weather and our sense of triumphing in the face of adversity. We also like irony. So despite the seriousness of the situation this morning, this tweet (well actually the pictures which make up the compilation) has proved very popular. Looking out the window, it's all very quiet (well actually it's pretty sunny) at Guardian towers in Kings Cross. In Ipswich - they even have rainbows: This from the Brighton and Hove area: London Mayor Boris Johnson will chair an emergency resilience meeting involving all emergency services and relevant agencies later this morning. He added this: Clearly this has been a difficult night for many Londoners, and continues to be an incredibly trying morning. Transport for London, the boroughs and the emergency services are working flat out in an effort to keep London moving and minimise disruption as far as is possible. I want to thank all the agencies for their professional response in incredibly testing conditions, and I'd urge Londoners to check before travelling by going to tfl.gov.uk for the latest information.\" Looks like a pretty big tree... 130 flights have been cancelled at Heathrow. Gatwick have cancelled just 4 according to their latest update. UK power networks spokesperson has just told Radio 4 Today that 140,000 homes and businesses are without power now across the South East and the East Anglia region. More reported damage in the South West: In Sussex where there have already been reports of over 120 fallen trees , police have said it has been a very busy night for them and again warned people not to play on the seafront and risk repeating the tragedy of a 14-year-old boy feared dead after he was swept into the sea at Newhaven. Superintendent Grenville Wilson said: \"At 3.30am, I was watching people on CCTV on Brighton Beach dancing around at the waves' edge, occasionally being overtaken by the advancing water. One slip and they could have found themselves in real danger, along with the people who would try to rescue them. \"We witnessed the tragic power of the sea at Newhaven yesterday and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the young lad who is sadly still missing. I don't want to see that repeated.\" Transport for London (TfL) has said there is disruption to six Underground lines due to debris from the storm on the tracks. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Metropolitan, Northern and Piccadilly lines are all partially closed while workers removed fallen trees and other obstructions, a TfL spokesman said. North west London, where more tracks are above ground, was the area most heavily affected by disruptions. Overground services were also disrupted, with services not likely to get under way until 9am as TfL scrambled to clear trees from the lines in the north of the capital. Whilst some jest about \"travel chaos\": The BBC are now reporting that 40,000 homes are without power now. We will hopefully get more reports soon but this from the Political Pictures Twitter account: Dover authorities have closed their port and will re-open only when it is safe to do so: Due to adverse weather conditions (strong winds gusting at 65 knots) the Port of Dover is currently closed (as of 6.30hrs). The primary concern of the Port and ferry operators is the safety of our customers and staff. We are monitoring the weather situation closely and liaising with the ferry operators with an aim to re-open the Port once it is safe to do so. Please note that there may be delays to services when the Port re-opens. We apologise for any delays or inconvenience as a result of this closure but you will appreciate that the safety and security of everyone is of the utmost importance. Robin Gisby, Network Rail’s managing director of network operations has just put out a statement saying all is going as planned despite at least 40 incidents on the tracks including a disabled train in Devon: Network Rail is dealing with this severe weather in exactly the way that we and the train operators planned over the weekend. We have had several hundred staff on duty through the night and into the morning to monitor conditions and react to any damage or disruption caused by hurricane-force winds. Safety remains our top priority. Already this morning we have found and cleared more than 40 line blockages caused by falling trees and we expect to find more as we complete our checks this morning. In four cases the train being sent through to inspect the line has hit a fallen tree and we have one train in Devon which is currently disabled following a collision with a fallen tree. We are also dealing with a landslip in the New Forest area. As the storm passes from west to east we will be carrying out safety assessments as quickly to clear routes and get trains running safely. We now expect to start services into Waterloo before 9am. Routes from Sussex, Kent and Anglia will follow. Services elsewhere into London are running but at reduced capacity and speed. Our South West correspondent, Steven Morris has sent us this update from one of the worst hit places in the UK: • The lights have gone out for around 7,000 homes, according to Western Power Distribution, which covers the south-west of England, south Wales and Midlands. • Gusts of 99mph reported on the Isle of Wight; 77mph in Southampton, 75mph-80mph in parts of Wiltshire • Both Severn motorway bridges in south Wales shut – 80mph diversion in place there. • Scores of trees down, including one across a dual carriageway in Plymouth. • Forty one flood alerts in place in the south-west of England (flooding possible); 16 warnings – flooding likely. • But where I am (close to Bristol) it already feels like the worst of it may have passed. Impressively, my newspaperman made it through to deliver my papers. Some London underground problems. TfL says there is no service between Northfields and Heathrow, and between Acton Town and Rayners Lane on the Picadilly line due to obstructions on the track. Services are also suspended on the Bakerloo line between Stonebridge Park and Harrow &amp; Wealdstone due to obstruction on the line at Kenton. The BBC reports that a train has collided with a tree near Ivybridge in Devon – no passengers on board and driver is unhurt. Here's an excellent map tweeted by MetDesk showing the extent of rain in the past 24 hours. The Plymouth Herald reports 28mm of rain in seven hours there yesterday, \"a similar amount to the level which caused flooding mayhem last year\". But police are already hailing their operation a \"great success\", which sounds suspiciously as though things may not have been quite as bad as expected. Three flood warnings have been added in the south-east to the 16 in the south-west previously referred to. Details here from the Environment Agency, and a handy ready-reckoner for all current warnings and alerts. About 6,000 homes were reported to be without power in the Plymouth and Exeter areas, but BBC local radio reports Western Power now says the number is down to about 2,000, with Crewkerne in Somerset the area worst affected. Heathrow, London City, Stansted and Gatwick are reporting \"severe\" disruption, others outside London expecting only \"medium\" according to the BBC airports website. All advise passengers to contact their airline before setting out. Here are the current flood warnings issued by the Environment Agency - 16 of them, all in the south-west. More to the point this morning: at least 60 trees reported down on Sussex roads overnight. Some helpful sources of information given out last night by David Cameron's office. BBC weather reports the overnight winds were \"slightly quieter than we thought\", but still developing and there are concerns as they pick up inland. Worst of the conditions are likely to peak in London pretty much exactly in the middle of the morning rush-hour. But after that there will be a \"dramatic improvement by mid-morning\" and maybe even a relatively pleasant autumn day. Met Office reports a new top wind speed of 99mph at the Needles Old Battery on Isle of Wight. But elsewhere a good 20mph or so less. During the 1987 storm winds got up to about 115mph. Some more detail on train delays and cancellations from the Press Association. First Capital Connect: no service expected until 9am. Southeastern: amended timetable with the possibility of services not starting until 9am or 10am. Greater Anglia and Stansted Express: no services until after 9am, then reduced service and significant disruption expected East Coast: amended timetable, with the first train leaving London's Kings Cross at 7.35am and the first arriving there at 8.56am. c2c: will run an amended service, with no trains until at least 9am. First Great Western: amended timetable until 10am, with just one train an hour between London Paddington and Swansea and Bristol Temple Meads, while Southern and Gatwick Express services will not run before 9am, and only with amended services after that. South West Trains: amended timetable, with no trains before 8am Transport for London: no service on the Overground line until 9am West Coast main line: an amended service may run before 9am but with delays and speed restrictions likely. Chiltern Railways: service \"as near to normal service as possible\". Eurostar: no cross-channel rail services until at least 7am. Last night the Newhaven RNLI posted a video of the monstrous seas during the search for the 14-year-old boy who was swept into the sea on Sunday. Twitter overnight has experienced a hail of lame jokes about the storm, but more serious updates are now coming more frequently. Still plenty of doubt out there about whether the most dire predictions will come to pass. Here's the Met Office map of the storm's likely path and extent. • The search for a 14-year-old boy swept out to sea at Newhaven, East Sussex, was called off for the night in conditions described as \"atrocious\". The Newhaven Lifeboat team tweeted: \"Our thoughts go to the boy's family and friends at this sad time.\" • An amber warning remained in place for southern England, south Wales, the midlands and eastern England • Winds reached a maximum of 93mph at the Needles Old Battery on the Isle of Wight at 1am. • About 60 flights have been cancelled at Heathrow airport, with other airports urging passengers to check the situation on Monday morning, especially as many train services to the airports will not be running until at least 9am. • Many train services have been cancelled or amended, especially before 9am. No London overground services are planned before that time, but most London underground services expected to run as normal. Check National Rail details here. • The Environment Agency issued four flood warnings in the south-west and 144 flood alerts across England and Wales. Flooding had already been reported in the early hours in parts of the south of England, including Cornwall, Sussex and parts of London. • Bridge and road closures due to strong winds included the M4 Severn crossing, the Dartford crossing southbound, the Orwell bridge in Suffolk and the Sheppey crossing in Kent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-german-anger-at-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-05T14:02:19Z","webTitle":"Günter Grass and changing German attitudes towards Israel | Hans Kundnani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-german-anger-at-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-german-anger-at-israel","fields":{"headline":"Günter Grass and changing German attitudes towards Israel","bodyText":"The anti-war poem published by Günter Grass is a subtle but straightforward example of a tendency in Germany that the historian Dan Diner has called \"exonerating projection\": the relativisation of the Holocaust through the implicit equation of Israel with Nazi Germany. In the poem, What Must Be Said, the 84 year-old Nobel prize-winner who was a member of the Waffen SS as a teenager imagines himself as a \"survivor\" of an Israeli nuclear strike on Iran. What must be said, according to Grass, is that \"the nuclear power Israel\" – rather than Iran – \"endangers an already fragile world peace\". Grass says he had not spoken out previously because his nationality \"forbade\" it: any German breaking the silence on the Israel nuclear programme may be accused of antisemitism. But, Grass goes on, the recent agreement to sell a sixth German Dolphin submarine to Israel meant Germany would now be partly responsible for \"a crime that can be foreseen\". It could not therefore make \"any of the usual excuses\" – presumably a reference to excuses made by Germans about the Holocaust. Grass thus felt he must break his silence \"with my last drop of ink\" – suggesting that this is the writer's last word. He says he hopes the poem will prompt others to \"liberate themselves from silence\" about Israel's nuclear weapons. The publication of the poem in the Süddeutsche Zeitung and other European newspapers has already prompted furious reactions in Germany and Israel. Josef Joffe writes in Die Zeit that Grass's poem was more about self-exoneration than about submarines. In an interview with Der Spiegel, the Israeli historian Tom Segev says that the poem seems to be more about Grass's long silence about his own Nazi past than about German silence about Israel's nuclear programme. However, what makes the publication of the poem significant is that it expresses a sense of anger against Israel that – justified or not – many Germans seem increasingly to share. This anger is partly a response to Israel's rightward shift during the past decade. But it seems also to be a product of developments in Germany and in particular the way that the Holocaust has receded in significance during the last decade. Increasingly, Germans seem to see themselves as victims rather than perpetrators. A poll in January 2009 – during the Gaza war – suggested that German attitudes to Israel were in flux. Nearly half of respondents said they saw Israel as an \"aggressive country\" and only around a third of respondents said they felt Germany had a special responsibility towards Israel. Sixty per cent said Germany had no special responsibility (the figure was even higher among younger Germans and among those living in the former East Germany). This anger against Israel is exacerbated by the sense some Germans have of not being able to say what they really think – as Grass suggests in the poem. This has created a pent-up resentment towards Israel that could at some point explode. It will be interesting to see whether Grass's poem leads in the next few weeks and months to the debate about Germany's \"special relationship\" with Israel that he seems to hope it would. Angela Merkel – who has declined to comment on Grass's poem – is personally committed to the Jewish state but is under increasing pressure on this issue, on which she is unusually out of step with German public opinion. Last year, Germany voted in favour of a UN resolution demanding a halt to Israeli settlement expansion – an unusual break with Israel. Later in the year, Germany opposed the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN. But according to one poll, 84% of Germans supported Palestinian statehood and 76% believed Germany should act to recognise it – an even higher proportion in each case than in France or the UK. An Israeli military strike on Iran could create a sudden rupture between Germany and Israel in the way that the Iraq war did between Germany and the US. My sense is that were Israel to launch a military strike on Iran, what remaining sympathy there is in Germany for Israel would evaporate almost overnight. A military strike would prompt another competition in Germany between the two principles of \"Never again war\" and \"Never again Auschwitz\", like the one that took place during the Kosovo war in 1999. At that time, Germans seemed to choose \"Never again Auschwitz\". But my instinct is that, a decade later, they would choose \"Never again war\". • Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"law/2012/mar/14/pacific-atomic-test-survivors-mod","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-14T13:43:00Z","webTitle":"Pacific atomic test survivors cannot sue Ministry of Defence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/14/pacific-atomic-test-survivors-mod","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2012/mar/14/pacific-atomic-test-survivors-mod","fields":{"headline":"Pacific atomic test survivors cannot sue Ministry of Defence","bodyText":"Survivors of Britain's 1950s atomic tests in the Pacific, who claim they suffered ill-health through exposure to radiation, have been prevented from suing the Ministry of Defence. By the narrowest of margins – four justices to three – the supreme court ruled that their action should be time-barred because it had been brought too late. Although the judgment relates to nine test cases, lawyers for the veterans say they will soon lodge high court compensation claims on behalf of hundreds of others, involving those who were more recently diagnosed with illnesses. Dismissing the nine test cases, Lord Justice Wilson said: \"It must be bad enough for the nine veterans together … to learn that they have lost their final round, but to learn that they lost by the narrowest of margins must make it even worse. \"Putting aside the law for one moment, all seven members of the court would wish to record their personal sympathy for the veterans.\" One of the nine died last weekend. The majority of justices found that the former servicemen had been aware of their illnesses since they formed a campaign group to press for compensation in the 1980s. The judges said that, under the Limitation Act 1980, their cases should have been brought within three years. The Ministry of Defence has always denied liability for the veterans' condition, insisting that low dose ionising radiation could not cause such injuries. The cases, Wilson added, \"rest on a false hope and should be brought to an end now and not later\". The veterans had contended that they did not have proper knowledge that their illnesses were connected to the atomic tests until medical research was published in 2007. Wendy Brothers, 73, a veteran's widow, said outside the court: \"I'm very disappointed. The MoD say that we have known about it for too long but they continue to say that nothing happened.\" Rose Clark, 71, whose husband, Michael, died of bone and lung cancer in 1992, said the case had not been \"about money, but getting official acknowledgement that the men had been put at risk\". She added: \"I lost my oldest grandson at the age of eight through leukaemia. I believe it was due to genetic damage. Michael was 19 at the time he was on Christmas Island, and witnessed five atomic bombs. \"He said he was so close he could see the bones of the people on the beach beside him. It was like an x-ray, he said. The army simply told him to turn away when the explosion occurred.\" The UK carried out 21 thermonuclear tests in Australia and the Pacific between 1952 and 1958, involving more than 22,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen. Of those, 1,011, or their surviving relatives, have lodged claims for compensation. Neil Sampson, the solicitor representing the veterans, said the government should follow the lead of other countries and set up a \"fair and just\" compensation scheme. \"The approach that this government takes is to waste resources on fighting veterans rather than co-operating with them,\" he said. \"Every other single nuclear power has established ways to recognise and compensate veterans. \"There are some things in life that are wrong. The approach of the government to this issue is one of those things.\" A spokesman for the MoD said after the ruling: \"The Ministry of Defence recognises the debt of gratitude we have to the servicemen who took part in the nuclear tests. \"They were important tests that helped to keep this nation secure at a difficult time in terms of nuclear technology. \"All the [supreme court] justices recognised that the veterans would face great difficulty proving a causal link between illnesses suffered and attendance at the tests. The supreme court described the claims as having no reasonable prospect of success and that they were doomed to fail. \"Where individual veterans are able to produce reliable evidence to raise a reasonable doubt that their illness is related to their service, they may be entitled to a war pension.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/29/gas-rebranded-green-energy-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-29T12:52:35Z","webTitle":"Gas rebranded as green energy by EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/29/gas-rebranded-green-energy-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/29/gas-rebranded-green-energy-eu","fields":{"headline":"Gas rebranded as green energy by EU","bodyText":"Energy from gas power stations has been rebranded as a green, low-carbon source of power by a €80bn European Union programme, in a triumph of the deep-pocketed fossil fuel industry lobby over renewable forms of power. In a secret document seen by the Guardian, a large slice of billions of euros of funds that are supposed to be devoted to research and development into renewables such as solar and wave power are likely to be diverted instead to subsidising the development of the well-established fossil fuel. The news comes as a report from the respected International Energy Agency predicted a \"golden age for gas\" with global production of \"unconventional\" sources of gas (notably shale gas extracted by hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking') tripling by 2035. The resulting drop in gas prices though risks stopping the development of renewable energy in its tracks, unless governments take action to support renewable technologies such as solar and wave power. \"Renewable energy may be the victim of cheap gas prices if governments do not stick to their renewable support schemes,\" said the IEA's chief economist, Fatih Birol. The insertion of gas energy as a low-carbon energy into an EU programme follows more 18 months of intensive lobbying by the European gas industry, which is attempting to rebrand itself as a green alternative to nuclear and coal, and as lower cost than renewable forms of power such as wind and sun. But green groups warned that relying on gas would raise energy prices and fail to tackle climate change, and could fatally stunt the growth of the renewables industry. Gas is a fossil fuel – but because it generates less carbon dioxide when burned than coal, gas industry lobbyists have been touting the fuel as a lower-carbon alternative to coal. The gains of switching from coal to gas are shortlived – any gas-fired power stations constructed today would be expected to continue in operation for at least 25 years. That would mean decades of carbon poured into the atmosphere – while scientists and industry experts warn that global emissions must peak by 2020 in order to avoid the worst manifestations of climate change. \"A golden age for gas is not necessarily a golden age for the climate,\" warned Birol. The document seen by the Guardian has been agreed by member states and sets out the framework for Horizon 2020, billed as a €80bn programme for research and innovation for the years 2014 to 2020. Of the funds available, more than €30bn are supposed to flow to \"address major concerns shared by all Europeans such as climate change, developing sustainable transport and mobility, making renewable energy more affordable, ensuring food safety and security, or coping with the challenge of an ageing population\", according to the European Commission. As part of this mission, Horizon2020 will dispense billions of euros in funds to research and development projects, and is intended to \"support research and innovation activities, strengthen the European scientific and technological base and foster benefits for society\". Clean energy is a key part of this, according to the document: \"The specific objective is to make the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system, in the face of increasingly scarce resources, increasing energy needs and climate change.\" But the original document has been altered by officials to include explicit references to funding for gas – despite gas being a fossil fuel and a mature technology. The document refers to an EU roadmap published last year that showed emissions from the power sector would have to be cut by 90% by 2050, to meet the EU's targets. To this has been added a new sentence: \"The roadmap also shows that gas, in the short to medium term, can contribute to the transformation of the energy system.\" The document carries on to include gas as a low-carbon source of power: \"To achieve these ambitious reductions, significant investments need to be made in research, development, demonstration and market roll-out of efficient, safe and reliable low-carbon energy technologies, including gas, and services.\" The reference to gas has been added. Though it is impossible to tell which member state asked for the amendment, Brussels insiders said it was likely to have needed the support of several member states. This reference shows that gas is now being considered in an official EU programme as a \"low-carbon\" form of energy, equivalent to renewables or nuclear power – despite its status as a fossil fuel. Finally, the last paragraph of the document shows that the R&amp;D funding programme originally intended only to support renewables has been altered to explicitly include fossil fuels. It reads: \"Activities [of the research and development programme] shall focus on research, development and full scale demonstration - of innovative renewables, efficient and flexible fossil power plants (including those using natural gas) and carbon capture and storage technologies.\" The reference to fossil fuels has been inserted. While the Horizon2020 project is likely to result in several billions of spending on R&amp;D between 2014 and 2020, the significance of the changes goes much further, according to Brussels experts. The changes show that the gas industry has succeeded in its aim of having gas considered a low-carbon fuel, at least in some parts of the European Commission – and this is likely to be disastrous for the renewables industry, as well as having massive implications for greenhouse gas emissions and the fight against climate change. Renewables compete with fossil fuels such as gas for investment, and if investors see that gas - which is a mature technology with low risks and high returns on investment - is favoured, they are likely to prioritise gas investment over renewables."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2009/nov/30/research-funding-cuts-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-30T15:42:11Z","webTitle":"Research funding cuts could jeopardise UK nuclear power programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/30/research-funding-cuts-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2009/nov/30/research-funding-cuts-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Research funding cuts could jeopardise UK nuclear power programme","bodyText":"Britain's plans to rebuild its ageing nuclear power infrastructure could be jeopardised by deep cuts that are due to be announced across university physics departments, scientists warn. Nuclear physicists said the entire field could be \"wiped out\" in British universities if research grants are slashed to fill a £40m hole in the finances of the major physics funding body. Researchers told the Guardian that nuclear physics is vulnerable to severe funding cuts because it is a minority group in a branch of science dominated by larger fields such as astronomy, cosmology and particle physics. \"We are worried that the STFC [Science and Technology Facilities Council] doesn't realise even minor cuts in nuclear physics could kill the subject in Britain at a time when we are embarking on a new nuclear power programme,\" said Professor Jim Al-Khalili, a physicist at the University of Surrey. A report published by the STFC last week reviewed the status of nuclear physics and engineering in Britain and found the workforce was adequate for only a minimal nuclear power building programme. If the government embarked on a more ambitious plan to build around 30 nuclear power stations over the next two decades, \"the present level of nuclear engineering research and development activity in the UK would be wholly insufficient both in terms of scope and volume,\" the report concluded. Some scientists believe the funding council decided not to publicise the report because it highlights the importance of nuclear expertise, which is central to the government's energy plans and plays a vital role in counterterrorism, healthcare, and radiological safety issues. The STFC has ordered a major review across all of the projects and facilities it funds with a view to prioritising science that turns a profit and closing down other research. The cuts in less favoured areas will be announced after a council meeting on 15 December. \"We don't know how the cuts will fall, but there is a real danger the entire field of nuclear physics research at universities in this country could be wiped out,\" said Professor Paul Nolan, a physicist at Liverpool University. \"You can't start decommisioning nuclear power plants and building new ones to run for another 50 years if you don't have people trained up to know what's going on,\" he added. Astronomers are also bracing themselves for cuts that could threaten international collaborations, including an agreement that gives them time on the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii. Physicists are still recovering from cuts imposed last year after the STFC discovered an £80m shortfall in its budget soon after it was formed by the merger of two other research councils in 2007. The STFC said it could not comment on which areas will lose funding before its review is completed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/31/burying-electric-pylons-cheaper-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-31T15:51:03Z","webTitle":"Burying electricity power lines 'cheaper than National Grid claims'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/31/burying-electric-pylons-cheaper-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/31/burying-electric-pylons-cheaper-government","fields":{"headline":"Burying electricity power lines 'cheaper than National Grid claims'","bodyText":"Countryside campaigners fighting hundreds of miles of 50-metre tall electricity pylons said on Tuesday that they have been vindicated by an independent report, which says burying cables is far cheaper than has been claimed by the National Grid. The report by engineering consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff into the comparative costs of routing transmission lines was commissioned by government planning body the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC). It found that underground cabling was 4.5-5.7 times more expensive than traditional overhead pylons. This compares with the claim of being 10-20 times more expensive, which is often made by the National Grid company in planning applications. The National Grid has been the monopoly supplier of UK pylons for 60 years. When costs are calculated over 40 years, overhead cables were found to cost between £2.2m/km and £4.2m/ km to install and maintain, compared with between £10.2m/km and £24m/km for those buried. Costs varied according to the technology used and the voltage of the lines. Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said the latest figures made it feasible for the government to insist that cables are buried when crossing national parks, or protected areas like areas of outstanding national beauty. Calling for a new study to consider environmental and social costs, a spokesman for the group said: \"We are not saying that you should bury all cables, and we accept that this is a more expensive option, but we think people would be prepared to pay a few extra pounds a year to have them buried in treasured landscapes like national parks and areas of outstanding beauty.\" The report's authors considered several ways to bury the cables, including putting them in tunnels, directly into the ground and in gas-insulated pipes. On every count, it was far cheaper to use overhead lines. The report did not try to calculate the social and environmental costs of the pylons, which have been deeply resented when proposed in some areas. However, it concluded that there may be visual intrusion, community disruption, loss of property values and concerns about radiation. However, National Grid said the study's findings were broadly in line with the costs it had been quoting. David Mercer, National Grid's major infrastructure development manager, added: \"This report will be a valuable contribution to the public debate on the right balance between visual impact and costs that must ultimately be paid for by consumers.\" More than 200 miles of new transmission lines are expected to be demanded in the next 10 years, in order to connect new nuclear power stations and onshore and offshore windfarms to the grid. The masts have been strongly opposed in Scotland, the Lake District and mid-Wales. Some of the proposed lines would cut through England's finest landscapes like the Mendip Hills, Somerset, and the Dedham Vale on the Essex-Suffolk border. The Campaign for National Parks (CNP) welcomed the report's findings. Its deputy chief executive, Ruth Chambers, said: \"We welcome the report's conclusion that underground solutions for electricity transmission are cheaper than previously thought. There will now be a more level playing field between overhead and underground technologies, making it easier for solutions that respect England's finest landscapes to be implemented.\" \"This is only part of the jigsaw. We wanted to give the IPC a tool to apply to future applications,\" said Mark Winfield, consultant with Parsons Brinkerhof and lead author of the report. Last year, a Danish \"T-Pylon\" design by Copenhagen-based practice Bystrup won a competition by the Department of Energy and Climate Change to design new pylons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-24T14:35:20Z","webTitle":"Stuxnet worm is the 'work of a national government agency'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency","fields":{"headline":"Stuxnet worm is the 'work of a national government agency'","bodyText":"A computer worm which targets industrial and factory systems is almost certainly the work of a national government agency, security experts told the Guardian – but warn that it will be near-impossible to identify the culprit. The \"Stuxnet\" computer worm, which has been described as one of the \"most refined pieces of malware ever discovered\", has been most active in Iran, says the security company Symantec – leading some experts to conjecture that the likely target of the virus is the controversial Bushehr nuclear power plant, and that it was created by Israeli hackers. Speaking to the Guardian, security experts confirmed that Stuxnet is a targeted attack on industrial locations in specific countries, the sophistication of which takes it above and beyond previous attacks of a similar nature. Latest figures, from August, show 60% of computers infected by Stuxnet are located in Iran – dramatically up from July, when it accounted for less than 25% of infections, research by Symantec shows, with the graph below (from 4 August) showing the prevalence in other countries by comparison. The company estimates that the group building Stuxnet would have been well-funded, comprising between five and 10 people, and that it would have taken six months to prepare. Alan Bentley, senior international vice president at security firm Lumension, said Stuxnet is \"the most refined piece of malware ever discovered\", and that the worm was significant because \"mischief or financial reward wasn't its purpose, it was aimed right at the heart of a critical infrastructure\". However Graham Cluley, senior consultant with the online security company Sophos, warned against jumping to conclusions about the target of the attack, saying \"sensationalist\" headlines were \"a worry\". Clulely is wary of reports linking Stuxnet with Israel: \"It's very hard to prove 100% who created a piece of malware, unless you are able to gather evidence from the computer they created it on – or if someone admits it, of course.\" But he said that its characteristics did not suggest a lone group. \"I think we need to be careful about pointing fingers without proof, and I think it's more appropriate – if true – to call this a state-sponsored cyber attack rather than cyber terrorism.\" Stuxnet works by exploiting previously unknown security holes in Microsoft's Windows operating system. It then seeks out a component called Simatic WinCC, manufactured by Siemens, which controls critical factory operations. The malware even uses a stolen cryptographic key belonging to the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer RealTek to validate itself in high-security factory systems. The worm then takes over the computer running the factory process – which for WinCC would be \"mission-critical\" systems which have to keep functioning under any circumstance – and \"blocks\" it for up to a tenth of a second. For high-speed systems, such as the centrifuges used for nuclear fuel processing being done by Iran, that could be disastrous, experts suggested. US army forces are aware of the threat posed by Stuxnet, general Keith Alexander confirmed this week, saying early indications showed that the worm was \"very sophisticated\". Clulely told that Guardian that Siemens has \"astonishingly\" advised power plants and manufacturing facilities not to change the default password that allows access to functions, despite it being exploited by Stuxnet and being \"public knowledge on the web for years\". Alan Bentley, SVP International at Lumension, told the Guardian: \"There is a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Iran was the target of Stuxnet. We know that the worm was designed with a specific target in mind – its makeup and the way it executes render the tell-tale signs. \"Combine this with the fact that the worm was identified by a Belarusian security firm working for an Iranian client and the fact that the nuclear power plant was not working properly for months, it is understandable that speculation points towards Iran as the target. But, without being inside the walls of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, we can't be certain.\" Rik Ferguson, senior security adviser at Trend Micro, said: \"Initially, it looks like a targeted attack. It saw a high percentage of infections concentrated in the Middle East. Iran being one. There's every possiblity that the [other countries affected] may have been collateral damage.\" Asked whether a nation state was behind the attack, Ferguson said: \"The truth is we don't know. But we can look at the concentration [of the attacks]. I don't think we can call this cyberwarfare, I would call it modern espionage. Countries have been spying on their neighbours for years – as the technology has improved, espionage has always improved, and this is step in that direction. \"It's significant because it's not just the malware but the vulnerability to infect machines – if this had been in more traditional, criminal hands it could have been more widely used, like Conficker was. This was a powerful vulnerability it exploited and usually either you sell it for a lot of money or use it for mass criminality.\" David Emm, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, told the Guardian: \"We think that Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state. \"This is a very sophisticated attack – the first of its kind – and has clearly been developed by a highly skilled group of people intent on gaining access to SCADA [supervisory control and data acquisition] systems – industrial control systems for monitoring and managing industrial infrastructure or facility-based processes. In contrast to the bulk of indiscriminate cybercrime threats on the internet, this has been aimed at very specific targets. It's different also because there's no obvious financial motivation behind the attack – rather the aim seems to be to sabotage systems.\" However, John Pescatore, vice president for internet security at Gartner, said it was \"definitely not the case\" that Stuxnet would have required state sponsorship. \"We've seen similarly targeted software going after credit card readers for financial gain in the past,\" he said. \"Governments have no monopoly on the talent. We've seen attacks that looked like they were state-sponsored in the past launched by hackers for attention or citizens' groups. You cannot tell just by looking at where it landed.\" The experts agree that Stuxnet marks a shift away from malware deployed for financial gain to controlling critical machinery. We are now moving into a \"third age\" of cyber crime, Clulely said, where the intention of making money from technical exploits is replaced by an intention to bring down critical infrastructure. \"We're entering this third age as well, where there are political, economic and military ways in which the internet can be exploited – and malware can be used – to gain advantage by foreign states. \"I think we will see more and more attacks which will be blamed on state-sponsored cyber attacks. There have been numerous attacks in the past which could be said to have possible military, political or economic motives, but it is very difficult to prove that a hack was ordered by Mossad or instead dreamt up by a Macclesfield student.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jun/12/iran-nuclear-moscow-ashton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-12T18:19:00Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear talks: Moscow meeting salvaged but real progress remains elusive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jun/12/iran-nuclear-moscow-ashton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jun/12/iran-nuclear-moscow-ashton","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear talks: Moscow meeting salvaged but real progress remains elusive","bodyText":"After a week of acerbic fencing between Tehran and Brussels, tempers appear to have been assuaged for the time being by an hour-long Monday night phone call between the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton and the chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili. In the course of that conversation Jalili dropped his insistence on a technical meeting before Moscow, which Ashton's office had opposed on the grounds that there had been countless meetings and conversations about the shape of the table and very little on what was going to be put on the table. Ashton's office issued a statement saying that Jalili had \"agreed on the need for Iran to engage\" on the proposals put forward last month in Baghdad by the six-nation group of negotiators (known in Brussels as the E3+3) for whom Ashton acts as coordinator. That is a step forward from last week when Jalili's deputy, Ali Bagheri, denied having seen those proposals. Jalili now at least acknowledges their existence, according to European diplomats. The Ashton statement 'also conveyed the E3+3's readiness to respond to the issues raised by the Iranians in Baghdad.' The Iranian media presented this as a reluctance western readiness to discuss Iran's five-point proposal. But it is not clear what those five points are. Jalili did not enumerate then in Baghdad. It was only when Iranian news reports claimed such a proposal had been made that the E3+3 diplomats and Ashton's officials hastily parsed the Iranian's remarks to try to separate out five distinct ideas. Some of what Jalili had to say had nothing to do with the nuclear issue. He presented a position paper on Syria and Bahrain for example. The only concrete demand he made was for the world to recognise Iran's right to enrich uranium, but as far as the E3+3 are concerned, that would be an end-point of negotiations and would depend on Iran being a lot more transparent about its programme to shore up trust that it is not pursuing nuclear weapons. One of the more hopeful signs of the day was a quote attributed to Jalili on Press TV saying that he would clarify his five points in Moscow. For example, Jalili did not mention sanctions relief at the Baghdad talks. If he puts them on the table in Russia, the ball would be in the other court, and meaningful negotiations could get going. Trita Parsi and Reza Marashi argue in a Huffington Post today that Europe should postpone its oil embargo, due to take effect on July 1, by six months, in return for a freeze on the production of 20%-enriched uranium. That would give all parties breathing space until after the November US presidential elections. If Barack Obama is reelected, he would have a freer hand to do deals. European governments are however nervous about offering more and more concessions as a response to Iranian inscrutability. They want Iran to put a clear proposal on the table and then bargain. Jalili may make a step towards clarity on Wednesday in a report to Iran's parliament, the Majlis, although it's not a forum famous for plain speaking. At the same time, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will be in Tehran to put more pressure on the theocratic government to frame a coherent proposal bargaining position. Jalili is in an unenviable position. His marching orders come in the form of ambiguous and somewhat ethereal pronouncements from the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and his job is to try to interpret those utterances at the bargaining table, well aware that he will be pilloried back in Tehran if he gets it wrong. It is not surprising he is nervous about making concrete statements, and reprimanded his deputy, Ali Bagheri, when he appeared to stray into specifics in Baghdad. Until now, Jalili has taken refuge from his dilemma in opaque declaratory rhetoric. In Moscow, he will have to be coaxed out of that blurry haven. It helps that Russia is playing host. Of all the six nations negotiating with Iran Russia has the closest relations with the Islamic Republic and has the most leverage. Vladimir Putin is presumably keen that Moscow should not go down in history as the end of the road for Iranian nuclear diplomacy. The political directors of the six powers have been huddling in Strasbourg this week rehearsing tactics. There had been reports from Washington that the Obama administration might try an ambitious new gambit of 'going big', taking a short cut to a comprehensive settlement and abandoning the step-by-step strategy followed until now. There seems to have been little sign of that in Strasbourg. One European diplomat said the Americans had told him they had simply been rehearsing scenarios in case the Iranians arrive in Moscow and suddenly put everything on the table. If there was an attempt to fast-track to a comprehensive settlement, it would presumably involve Iran accepting a more intrusive regime of IAEA inspections, known as the Additional Protocol, and cooperating fully with the IAEA's investigation of evidence that Iran had a weapons programme in the past. (Talks on that investigation broke down on the weekend). Once international confidence was deemed to be restored, the UN security council would reverse its demand for Iran to stop enriching uranium at all and endorse low level enrichment, suitable for fuel for modern nuclear power stations. Taking such big steps, however, involves mutual trust, which is why the negotiations this year have focused on small reciprocal confidence-building measures. Judging by the acrimony of the past few days, this approach has ceased to be very productive, despite some early hopeful signs. What we have instead on the road to Moscow is a messy game of chicken with each side daring the other to bring the talks to a halt and thereby risk Israeli military action. It is not a recipe for success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/17/gas-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-17T05:30:00Z","webTitle":"Go-ahead for fracking is not the start of a golden age for gas | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/17/gas-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/17/gas-gas","fields":{"headline":"Go-ahead for fracking is not the start of a golden age for gas","bodyText":"Do not be distracted by the UK government's modest pause for consultation, its scientific report on the Blackpool earthquakes caused by gas fracking gives the go-ahead for drilling. \"We see no reason why [it] should not be allowed to proceed,\" concluded the experts. \"We are pleased the experts have come to a clear conclusion that it is safe to allow us to resume,\" echoed Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla, the company drilling the holes. The deeper question is whether gas driven from shattered underground strata will rock the UK's energy scene as violently as it has in the US. There gas prices have plummeted, in direct contrast to the huge hikes seen in UK home energy bills. The short answer is no. The report fails to put to bed all concerns over seismic safety. But more importantly the crowded island we inhabit is very different to the wide open spaces of America, even if the gas fracker's heroic guesses on how much gas may be under our feet turn out to be correct. The scientists rightly point out that tremors resulting from subterannean meddling are nothing new. Half of all the UK's earthquakes in the last 100 years were caused by coal mining. They also rightly highlight that the biggest tremblors likely to result from gas fracking - about magnitude three - might crack the plaster in a house unlucky enough to be overhead, but it will not rend Lancashire asunder. The report did not consider all potential problems, however. \"The government also needs to pay attention to the earthquake risks of disposing of flow-back water by injection underground after fracking,\" said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh. That is significant, because getting rid of the vast quantities of dirty water produced by fracking by squirting it underground is precisely the reason why magnitude three and greater earthquakes in the US have more than quadrupled since 2008. Will these tremors damage the wells and allow gas and fracking chemicals to contaminate drinking water? Probably not, say the scientists, if the drilling is performed perfectly. But drilling perfection is hard to achieve, as BP found on the Deepwater rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Even if the gas could be sprung from the ground safely, how much is down there? Cuadrilla reckons a reserve of 200 trillion cubic feet. If correct, that would send Blackpool from the periphery of the UK tourist industry to the centre of the global gas market. This small patch of Lancashire would be the biggest single reserve in the world. The figure is 40 times the estimate the British Geological Survey made for an area 15 times larger than Cuadrilla's licence area. Geologists say reliable estimates need hundreds of wells: Cuadrilla have two. Nonetheless, there is gas there, and some cheap gas would definitely warm the hearts of homeowners who have seen their bills blow up in recent years. The good news is that the wholesale price of gas in the US is half of that in Europe. The bad news, according to Deutsche Bank, is that European shale gas will cost twice as much to produce. The earthquakes may have shaken public awareness, but this is the true shock: that the downwards jolt to gas prices promised by shale fracking appears built on weak foundations. \"Those waiting for a shale gas 'revolution' outside the US will likely be disappointed, in terms of both price and the speed at which high-volume production can be achieved,\" concluded Deutsche Bank's analysts. The International Energy Agency expects negligible production before 2020 in Europe. The bankers also warned of the opposition of local residents and environmental groups in the UK, where population density is over seven times that in the US. \"The impact to the landscape and quality of life of drilling operations will likely be felt more acutely ... This may make it difficult and time-consuming to acquire local planning permission,\" they wrote. Developers of wind farms and incinerators would scare prospective gas frackers with their despatches from the planning wars. Lastly, all of the above ignores the fundamental reason energy policy has emerged from its policy wonk cave: climate change. Gas is lower carbon than coal, but it is not low carbon. The government believes we can dash for gas once more - while we wait for new nuclear power, and carbon capture and storage technology to bury our pollution - and still fulfil our our legally binding cuts in carbon emissions. That may be possible, at the expense of pipelining bill payer's cash into gas companies, to compensate them for shutting their power stations early. Unlike fracking, the alternative put forward by green campaigners does not involve moving the Earth, but would instead require a seismic shift in policy. \"We should be developing the huge potential of clean British energy from the sun, wind and waves, not more dirty and dangerous fossil fuels, \" said Friends of the Earth's head Andy Atkins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/may/22/iran-nuclear-talks-optimism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear talks: signs of cautious optimism emerge | Gabrielle Rifkind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/22/iran-nuclear-talks-optimism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/may/22/iran-nuclear-talks-optimism","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear talks: signs of cautious optimism emerge","bodyText":"A tone of cautious optimism has crept into the flurry of diplomatic activity taking place in the shadows ahead of the Iran nuclear talks in Baghdad on Wednesday. For once, it looks as if there is a real prospect of launching serious negotiations. There is immense pressure on these talks and should they fail, there will be a risk of an all-out war in the region. The mood music is changing, with the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, reiterating his fatwa condemning nuclear weapons and calling them a cardinal sin. Interestingly, this coincided with the reissue of a book in Tehran on the importance of negotiation in Shia history; the final two words of the book's title are \"flexibility and compromise\". In parallel, President Obama's statements have more been conciliatory in tone, emphasising diplomacy above military threats and stating that Iran had not decided to construct a nuclear weapon. This is complemented by the statement by the Israeli chief of general staff, Benny Gantz, who said that Iran is a \"rational actor\" and will not produce a nuclear bomb, although there is no meeting of minds with his bosses, defence minister Ehud Barak and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. A looming deadline with a threat of new sanctions coming into effect by the end of June puts pressure on the parties to yield results. This may have contributed to the change of stance in Tehran, but trust takes much longer to build and a sustained long-term process will need to be established, not least because there will be \"spoilers\" who have a vested interest in seeing the talks fail. The Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, recently said: \"A house can burn to the ground in minutes but takes a long time to build. Similarly, trust can easily and rapidly be broken, but it takes a long time to build, dialogue is a process and not an event.\" The Oxford Research Group (ORG) recently engaged in a series of high-level consultations with individuals close to the decision-making process on the Iranian nuclear file, with the aim of finding a workable and realistic solution to the impasse. The consultation clarified the key areas of agreement that would allow for a successful negotiation between Iran and the west – see our report, Iran's Nuclear Impasse: Breaking the Deadlock. There are now optimistic signs seeping from the official talks process: it is the first time the parties have agreed to frame the negotiations within the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This matters to the Iranians as previous negotiating positions by the so-called E3+3 (Britain, France and Germany, plus the US, Russia and China) have demanded that Iran suspends uranium enrichment and this has proven an obstacle for progress in the talks. For a successful negotiation, the E3+3 will want a clear commitment from Iran that it is not producing nuclear weapons, and assurances that the Iranian nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. This will require much wider intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in which it can be verified that Iran is a non-nuclear state. For Iran, it will be important that its legitimate right to enrich uranium under the NPT is respected and, that a lifting of the full set of UN security council sanctions is carried out once a settlement is reached. This will be a gradual process and a wider framework will need to be established to address the regional security issues. While there is little appetite for a \"grand bargain\", regional security will depend on respecting the regional security concerns of the multiple parties involved. Driving the fear in Tehran, and of enormous importance, is the belief that the international community's real motivation is regime change. There will need to be assurances that the future of the domestic regime in Tehran is a matter for its own people. Mirroring this fear is Israel's concern about Iran's desire not to see the survival of the Israeli state. These fears run deep and will also need to be addressed. It is these insecurities that lie behind the aggressive behaviour of both governments. It will take time to create a climate in which the motives of the other are not viewed with suspicion and mistrust, and where proposals are not seen as tricks with the only purpose to cheat the other side, and saying \"yes\" is not portrayed as an admission of weakness. Previous negotiations have been structured in such a way that meetings are piecemeal and fragmented. While technical agreements have been proposed, they broke down in the past because of the mistrust and suspicion that exists on all sides. Official processes often do not have the time to examine the nature of the relationships and therefore we need a parallel track to support negotiations to build the trust. Because we see a regime as unfriendly, we assume the worst motives and intentions, fuelling our perception of threat. If the Pahlavi family had remained on the Peacock throne in Iran, there would probably have been as many as 20 nuclear power plants in Iran today, based on plans the Shah had drawn up with US and Europe in the 1960s. Political expediency allows our allies to do dangerous things while we chastise and punish our non-allies for doing the same. The real challenge is now to set the frame for a serious negotiation, which builds on the area of potential common agreement, addresses both the politics and deals with the climate of mistrust. A long, hard path lies ahead, but without a sustainable process agreed and built into the negotiations it will empower those who have an interest in undermining a successful outcome. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2011/apr/05/tokyo-electric-power-company-turns-toxic","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T19:25:00Z","webTitle":"Tokyo Electric Power Company turns toxic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/05/tokyo-electric-power-company-turns-toxic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/apr/05/tokyo-electric-power-company-turns-toxic","fields":{"headline":"Tokyo Electric Power Company turns toxic","bodyText":"As engineers continue to fight to prevent catastrophe at the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant, executives at its controversial operating company are also struggling to prevent a financial meltdown. Shares in the Tokyo Electric Power Company plunged again on the Nikkei stock index yesterday. They fell 18% to a 60-year low of ¥362 and the company said it was delaying publication of its annual earnings report due to the crisis. In Tokyo, the air is thick with talk that Tepco might have to be nationalised as losses mount and investors brace themselves for compensation claims running into billions. Government intervention could leave investors out of pocket, sparking outrage in a country where capital has been king since the end of the second world war. The omens aren't looking good as the human and environmental tragedy grows worse by the day and the Japanese lose faith in their nuclear industry. Japanese media report that ministers are considering nationalisation to prevent a dramatic loss of investor confidence on world markets. The government and the company have played down that idea, but what happens next depends on how quickly the plant can be made safe and confidence restored. Tepco faces huge costs for replacement power, the construction of new generation capacity to replace its damaged plants and the decommissioning of at least four and possibly all six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi facility. Factor in unquantified damages to local residents and businesses affected by radiation leaks, not to mention the possibility of lawsuits rumbling in the background, no wonder investors are dumping the shares. Yusuke Ueda, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Tepco could face compensation charges of more than ¥10tn (£74bn) if the crisis runs for more than two years. The price of insuring Tepco debt against default has soared as more investors bet the company will struggle to pay creditors. \"I think the company will survive, but … financial aid … will be necessary,\" said Koichi Ogawa at Daiwa SB Investments. \"If Tepco were to default on its debt that would be a worry to the financial system so I don't think that's going to happen,\" he adds. Tepco is being supported by the Bank of Japan and other major Japanese banks. Three institutions – Sumitomo Mitsui Financial, Mizuho Financial and Mitsubishi – are lending ¥1.9tr to help it deal with the crisis. But question marks over whether the group can meet the costs of the disaster without outside help have prompted credit rating downgrades by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Moody's said: \"Tepco will remain highly leveraged and unprofitable for an extended period of time and will face substantial risk regarding nuclear liability.\" S&amp;P said: \"Tepco will face significant deterioration in its operating and free cash flows over the next couple of years as a result of higher operating costs as it moves to oil and LNG [liquefied natural gas].\" According to a note from UFJ Morgan Stanley: \"If we think about all the people and businesses affected by the incident, and the compensation that would have to be paid, there is no way shareholders can be fully protected.\" BP faced a similar nightmare after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill debacle, but earns around $20bn(£12bn) in a good year and had a portfolio of valuable businesses to sell to meet a bill of $30bn. Not so Tepco, which made a profit last year of £1bn and has few assets to put on the auction block. Then there is the reputational damage, which is much harder quantify in monetary terms. The Japanese government has lambasted Tepco for its handling of the nuclear disaster. The utility has sown anxiety among the public by giving confusing radiation readings, being slow to admit to the seriousness of the situation and plodding in its response. Many Japanese people no longer trust what its officials say. Recent US embassy cables released by the Wikileaks website revealed deep unease about all the different nuclear power companies operating in Japan, of which Tepco is the largest. Taro Kono, an MP, claimed in talks with US diplomats that these firms were \"hiding the costs and safety problems associated with nuclear energy.\" Although Tepco wasn't named, a report a few years ago found that Tepco falsified nuclear safety data at least 200 times between 2000 and 2007. Not surprisingly, Japanese anti-nuclear campaigners have Tepco in their sights and are demanding the government take decisive action to shut it down and mothball its plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/aug/24/us-election-2012-romney-obama-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-24T13:39:42Z","webTitle":"US election 2012: Romney and Obama avoid the climate change elephant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/aug/24/us-election-2012-romney-obama-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/aug/24/us-election-2012-romney-obama-climate","fields":{"headline":"US election 2012: Romney and Obama avoid the climate change elephant","bodyText":"The Republicans roll into Tampa next week – hurricanes permitting – for their national convention where Mitt Romney will be officially confirmed as the party's candidate for president. The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by the highly controversial \"legitimate rape\" remarks made by Todd Atkin, a congressman from Missouri, and his subsequent refusal to quit his bid for re-election despite pressure from the party's leadership. But while the US media has largely focused on this unedifying internal battle, Mitt Romney has laid out his all-important energy plans for the country. The headline is that, if elected as president, he will make the US \"energy independent\" by 2020 and, by doing so, create three million jobs. To eliminate the nation's reliance on imported oil and gas, Romney says he will lift many offshore drilling restrictions and free up states to use federal lands for energy production. By contrast, there was little focus in his plan on renewables, such as wind and solar. In essence, he has merged George W Bush's \"we're addicted to oil\" remarks with Sarah Palin's \"drill, baby, drill\". (It's possibly not a coincidence that his plan was announced just hours after he had raised $7m from oil industry executives at an election fundraiser in Texas.) But Obama hasn't exactly moved heaven and earth to differentiate himself from Romney on energy. Yes, he certainly talks up renewables more – his latest campaign ad shows him next to solar panels – but at his own fundraiser on Wednesday, he said: Oil production is up. Natural gas is up. But we're also doubling the energy that we get from wind and solar. That is clean, it's renewable, it's homegrown, it's creating jobs all across America. Nowhere amid all this talk of energy independence was any explicit reference to the climate implications of increased exploitation of \"homegrown\" fossil fuels. While the subject remains utterly toxic for Republicans, even Obama rarely raises the topic these days. This week, an Obama spokesman indicated that climate change would not be a major campaigning issue for Democrats: Clearly [climate change] is something that is important to the administration, but right now we are obviously going to be focusing on jobs and the economy and talking about what our contrast is. Signalling the intense frustration of environmental groups on this matter, the League of Conservation Voters has even launched an online petition urging PBS's Jim Lehrer, who will moderate the first presidential TV debate on 3 October, to ask a climate-related question. Even more revealing, a document will be released next week at the Republican convention that will likely shine a light on just how far down the political radar climate change has fallen over the past few years in the US since the heady days when Obama routinely mentioned it during his previous election campaign. At each convention, the political parties publish their \"platform\" document. In essence, it is a manifesto that has been discussed and signed-off by a committee of party representatives from across all the states. During previous presidential election, the platform has been a largely symbolic and bureaucratic exercise. But the US media is signalling this year that the platform documents will be more intensely scrutinised than before, in part due to the internal wrangles triggered by Todd Atkins. On Monday and Tuesday, the Republican platform committee met in Tampa in advance of the convention to finalise the document. Very little has been leaked to the press – bar the section on abortion – but one member of the platform committee from West Virginia has given a teaser. Conrad Lucas, the state's Republican chairman, said in a report in the Charleston Daily Mail: \"Once the platform is released, I think the voters in West Virginia are going to be very interested because of the pro-coal and natural gas positions that are in it\"… Lucas also offered an amendment during committee meetings this week to include a formal statement opposing Obama's cap-and-trade energy policy. \"I was happy that we got opposition to cap-and-trade reinserted in the platform, which it wasn't in 2008,\" he said. \"It was unanimously approved, which I was excited about.\" West Virginia is well known as \"coal country\", but further south in Texas, where the oil industry dominates, the state's Republican platform document has been released online (pdf). It provides an eye-popping insight into Republican thinking in that part of the country. It will certainly be interesting to see how much of it feeds into the national platform document, when it is finally published next week. It would be easy to be distracted by the extraordinary sections on homosexuality (\"contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God\") and the teaching of \"controversial subjects\" in schools (\"we believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced\"), but let's stick to those tightly focused on energy and the environment... Protection from Extreme Environmentalists – We strongly oppose all efforts of the extreme environmental groups that stymie legitimate business interests. We strongly oppose those efforts that attempt to use the environmental causes to purposefully disrupt and stop those interests within the oil and gas industry. We strongly support the immediate repeal of the Endangered Species Act. We strongly oppose the listing of the dune sage brush lizard either as a threatened or an endangered species. We believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be abolished... Energy Strategy – We encourage a comprehensive energy policy that allows more development of domestic energy sources and reduces our need for foreign energy. Energy policy should be cooperative, economically viable without taxpayer funded subsidies, and environmentally safe, but not restricted by overzealous environmental activism. Alternative Energy Sources – We encourage economically viable use of wind, coal-fired plants, solar, and nuclear power, and bio-sources without government subsidies. Government Restrictions – We support immediate removal of government barriers to free market solutions to production and distribution of energy including restrictions on: drilling and production operations on public and private lands and waters refineries electric power generation and distribution federal gas mileage standards (CAFÉ standards) and fuel blends. Cap and Trade – We oppose Cap and Trade (\"Cap and Tax\"). U.S. Department of Energy – We support the elimination of the Department of Energy. Incandescent Light Bulbs - We support the freedom to continue to use and manufacture incandescent light bulbs. Keystone XL Pipeline – We support the immediate approval and construction of the Keystone XL and other pipelines that will reduce our reliance on imported oil and natural gas from unstable or unfriendly countries. Deep Water Drilling – We support immediate resumption of deep water drilling and production in the Gulf of Mexico. Land Drilling – We support land drilling and production operations including hydraulic fracturing. Ethanol – We support the repeal of legislation mandating ethanol as fuel additives and/or primary fuel. Natural Gas - Alternative Fuel - We urge the use of natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel and as complimentary fuel to gasoline and diesel. We support the manufacture of vehicles that utilize natural gas as an alternative fuel and/or a complimentary fuel. We support and encourage the conversion of existing private fleets to natural gas as a dual use fuel. We support the use of natural gas in electric power generation and other industrial uses... United Nations – We support the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations and the removal of U.N. headquarters from U.S. soil. United Nations Agenda 21 -The Republican Party of Texas should expose all United Nations Agenda 21 treaty policies and its supporting organizations, agreements and contracts. We oppose implementation of the UN Agenda 21 Program which was adopted at the Earth Summit Conference in 1992 purporting to promote a comprehensive program of sustainable development projects, nationally, regionally and locally. We oppose the influence, promotion and implementation of nongovernmental organizations, metropolitan and/or regional planning organizations, Councils of Government, and International Council for Local Environmental initiatives and the use of American (Texas) citizen's taxes to promote these programs. Remember that these are the official policy positions of the Republican party in one of the US's most populous and influential states. It remains to be seen next week how much of this Tea Party-type of thinking filters through into the Republican's national platform document, but the statements above certainly provide a somewhat unpalatable hors d'oeuvre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/nov/17/iran-want-nuclear-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-17T18:16:04Z","webTitle":"If you lived in Iran, wouldn't you want the nuclear bomb? | Mehdi Hasan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/17/iran-want-nuclear-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/17/iran-want-nuclear-bomb","fields":{"headline":"If you lived in Iran, wouldn't you want the nuclear bomb?","bodyText":"Imagine, for a moment, that you are an Iranian mullah. Sitting crosslegged on your Persian rug in Tehran, sipping a cup of chai, you glance up at the map of the Middle East on the wall. It is a disturbing image: your country, the Islamic Republic of Iran, is surrounded on all sides by virulent enemies and regional rivals, both nuclear and non-nuclear. On your eastern border, the United States has 100,000 troops serving in Afghanistan. On your western border, the US has been occupying Iraq since 2003 and plans to retain a small force of military contractors and CIA operatives even after its official withdrawal next month. Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation, is to the south-east; Turkey, America's Nato ally, to the north-west; Turkmenistan, which has acted as a refuelling base for US military transport planes since 2002, to the north-east. To the south, across the Persian Gulf, you see a cluster of US client states: Bahrain, home to the US Fifth Fleet; Qatar, host to a forward headquarters of US Central Command; Saudi Arabia, whose king has exhorted America to \"attack Iran\" and \"cut off the head of the snake\". Then, of course, less than a thousand miles to the west, there is Israel, your mortal enemy, in possession of over a hundred nuclear warheads and with a history of pre-emptive aggression against its opponents. The map makes it clear: Iran is, literally, encircled by the United States and its allies. If that wasn't worrying enough, your country seems to be under (covert) attack. Several nuclear scientists have been mysteriously assassinated and, late last year, a sophisticated computer virus succeeded in shutting down roughly a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Only last weekend, the \"pioneer\" of the Islamic Republic's missile programme, Major General Hassan Moghaddam, was killed – with 16 others – in a huge explosion at a Revolutionary Guards base 25 miles outside Tehran. You go online to discover western journalists reporting that the Mossad is believed to have been behind the blast. And then you pause to remind yourself of the fundamental geopolitical lesson that you and your countrymen learned over the last decade: the US and its allies opted for war with non-nuclear Iraq, but diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea. If you were our mullah in Tehran, wouldn't you want Iran to have the bomb – or at the very minimum, \"nuclear latency\" (that is, the capability and technology to quickly build a nuclear weapon if threatened with attack)? Let's be clear: there is still no concrete evidence Iran is building a bomb. The latest report from the IAEA, despite its much discussed reference to \"possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme\", also admits that its inspectors continue \"to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material at [Iran's] nuclear facilities\". The leaders of the Islamic Republic – from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to bombastic President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – maintain their goal is only to develop a civilian nuclear programme, not atomic bombs. Nonetheless, wouldn't it be rational for Iran – geographically encircled, politically isolated, feeling threatened – to want its own arsenal of nukes, for defensive and deterrent purposes? The US government's Nuclear Posture Review admits such weapons play an \"essential role in deterring potential adversaries\" and maintaining \"strategic stability\" with other nuclear powers. In 2006, the UK's Ministry of Defence claimed our own strategic nuclear deterrent was designed to \"deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against our vital interests that cannot be countered by other means\". Apparently, what is sauce for the Anglo-American goose is not sauce for the Iranian gander. Empathy is in short supply. As leading US nuclear policy analyst George Perkovich has observed: \"The US government never has publicly and objectively assessed Iranian leaders' motivations for seeking nuclear weapons and what the US and others could do to remove those motivations.\" Instead, the Islamic Republic is dismissed as irrational and megalomaniacal. But it isn't just Iran's leaders who are unwilling to back down on the nuclear issue. On Tuesday, around 1,000 Iranian students formed a human chain around the uranium conversion facility in Isfahan, chanting \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\". Their protest may have been organised by the authorities but even the leaders and members of the opposition Green Movement tend to support Iran's uranium enrichment programme. According to a 2010 University of Maryland survey, 55% of Iranians back their country's pursuit of nuclear power and, remarkably, 38% support the building of a nuclear bomb. So what is to be done? Sanctions haven't worked and won't work. Iranians refuse to compromise on what they believe to be their \"inalienable\" right to nuclear power under the Non-proliferation treaty. Military action, as the US defence secretary Leon Panetta admitted last week, could have \"unintended consequences\", including a backlash against \"US forces in the region\". The threat of attack will only harden the resolve for a nuclear deterrent; belligerence breeds belligerence. The simple fact is there is no alternative to diplomacy, no matter how truculent or paranoid the leaders of Iran might seem to western eyes. If a nuclear-armed Iran is to be avoided, US politicians have to dial down their threatening rhetoric and tackle the very real and rational perception, on the streets of Tehran and Isfahan, of America and Israel as military threats to the Islamic Republic. Iranians are fearful, nervous, defensive – and, as the Middle East map shows, perhaps with good reason. As the old adage goes, just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not out to get you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2013/jun/19/barack-obama-berlin-speech-full-text","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-19T15:23:45Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama's Berlin speech – full text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/19/barack-obama-berlin-speech-full-text","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/jun/19/barack-obama-berlin-speech-full-text","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama's Berlin speech – full text","bodyText":"Hello, Berlin! Thank you, Chancellor Merkel, for your leadership, your friendship, and the example of your life – from a child of the East to the leader of a free and united Germany. As I've said, Angela and I don't exactly look like previous German and American leaders. But the fact that we can stand here today, along the fault line where a city was divided, speaks to an eternal truth: No wall can stand against the yearning of justice, the yearnings for freedom, the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart. Mayor Wowereit, distinguished guests, and especially the people of Berlin and of Germany – thank you for this extraordinarily warm welcome. In fact, it's so warm and I feel so good that I'm actually going to take off my jacket, and anybody else who wants to, feel free to. We can be a little more informal among friends. As your Chancellor mentioned, five years ago I had the privilege to address this city as senator. Today, I'm proud to return as President of the United States. And I bring with me the enduring friendship of the American people, as well as my wife, Michelle, and Malia and Sasha. You may notice that they're not here. The last thing they want to do is to listen to another speech from me. So they're out experiencing the beauty and the history of Berlin. And this history speaks to us today. Here, for thousands of years, the people of this land have journeyed from tribe to principality to nation-state; through Reformation and Enlightenment, renowned as a \"land of poets and thinkers,\" among them Immanuel Kant, who taught us that freedom is the \"unoriginated birthright of man, and it belongs to him by force of his humanity.\" Here, for two centuries, this gate stood tall as the world around it convulsed – through the rise and fall of empires; through revolutions and republics; art and music and science that reflected the height of human endeavor, but also war and carnage that exposed the depths of man's cruelty to man. It was here that Berliners carved out an island of democracy against the greatest of odds. As has already been mentioned, they were supported by an airlift of hope, and we are so honored to be joined by Colonel Halvorsen, 92 years old – the original \"candy bomber.\" We could not be prouder of him. I hope I look that good, by the way, when I'm 92. During that time, a Marshall Plan seeded a miracle, and a North Atlantic Alliance protected our people. And those in the neighborhoods and nations to the East drew strength from the knowledge that freedom was possible here, in Berlin – that the waves of crackdowns and suppressions might therefore someday be overcome. Today, 60 years after they rose up against oppression, we remember the East German heroes of June 17th. When the wall finally came down, it was their dreams that were fulfilled. Their strength and their passion, their enduring example remind us that for all the power of militaries, for all the authority of governments, it is citizens who choose whether to be defined by a wall, or whether to tear it down. And we're now surrounded by the symbols of a Germany reborn. A rebuilt Reichstag and its glistening glass dome. An American embassy back at its historic home on Pariser Platz. And this square itself, once a desolate no man's land, is now open to all. So while I am not the first American President to come to this gate, I am proud to stand on its Eastern side to pay tribute to the past. For throughout all this history, the fate of this city came down to a simple question: Will we live free or in chains? Under governments that uphold our universal rights, or regimes that suppress them? In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will, or in closed societies that suffocate the soul? As free peoples, we stated our convictions long ago. As Americans, we believe that \"all men are created equal\" with the right to life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And as Germans, you declared in your Basic Law that \"the dignity of man is inviolable.\" Around the world, nations have pledged themselves to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all members of our human family. And this is what was at stake here in Berlin all those years. And because courageous crowds climbed atop that wall, because corrupt dictatorships gave way to new democracies, because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say, here in Berlin, here in Europe – our values won. Openness won. Tolerance won. And freedom won here in Berlin. And yet, more than two decades after that triumph, we must acknowledge that there can, at times, be a complacency among our Western democracies. Today, people often come together in places like this to remember history – not to make it. After all, we face no concrete walls, no barbed wire. There are no tanks poised across a border. There are no visits to fallout shelters. And so sometimes there can be a sense that the great challenges have somehow passed. And that brings with it a temptation to turn inward – to think of our own pursuits, and not the sweep of history; to believe that we've settled history's accounts, that we can simply enjoy the fruits won by our forebears. But I come here today, Berlin, to say complacency is not the character of great nations. Today's threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity – that struggle goes on. And I've come here, to this city of hope, because the tests of our time demand the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago. Chancellor Merkel mentioned that we mark the anniversary of President John F Kennedy's stirring defense of freedom, embodied in the people of this great city. His pledge of solidarity – \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" – echoes through the ages. But that's not all that he said that day. Less remembered is the challenge that he issued to the crowd before him: \"Let me ask you,\" he said to those Berliners, \"let me ask you to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today\" and \"beyond the freedom of merely this city.\" Look, he said, \"to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.\" President Kennedy was taken from us less than six months after he spoke those words. And like so many who died in those decades of division, he did not live to see Berlin united and free. Instead, he lives forever as a young man in our memory. But his words are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country. They demand that we embrace the common endeavor of all humanity. And if we lift our eyes, as President Kennedy called us to do, then we'll recognize that our work is not yet done. For we are not only citizens of America or Germany – we are also citizens of the world. And our fates and fortunes are linked like never before. We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe. We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered. We may enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the world, but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment, we're not truly prosperous. I say all this here, in the heart of Europe, because our shared past shows that none of these challenges can be met unless we see ourselves as part of something bigger than our own experience. Our alliance is the foundation of global security. Our trade and our commerce is the engine of our global economy. Our values call upon us to care about the lives of people we will never meet. When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears,we do things that no other nations can do, no other nations will do. So we have to lift up our eyes today and consider the day of peace with justice that our generation wants for this world. I'd suggest that peace with justice begins with the example we set here at home, for we know from our own histories that intolerance breeds injustice. Whether it's based on race, or religion, gender or sexual orientation, we are stronger when all our people – no matter who they are or what they look like – are granted opportunity, and when our wives and our daughters have the same opportunities as our husbands and our sons. When we respect the faiths practiced in our churches and synagogues, our mosques and our temples, we're more secure. When we welcome the immigrant with his talents or her dreams, we are renewed. When we stand up for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and treat their love and their rights equally under the law, we defend our own liberty as well. We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness. And as long as walls exist in our hearts to separate us from those who don't look like us, or think like us, or worship as we do, then we're going to have to work harder, together, to bring those walls of division down. Peace with justice means free enterprise that unleashes the talents and creativity that reside in each of us; in other models, direct economic growth from the top down or relies solely on the resources extracted from the earth. But we believe that real prosperity comes from our most precious resource – our people. And that's why we choose to invest in education, and science and research. And now, as we emerge from recession, we must not avert our eyes from the insult of widening inequality, or the pain of youth who are unemployed. We have to build new ladders of opportunity in our own societies that – even as we pursue new trade and investment that fuels growth across the Atlantic. America will stand with Europe as you strengthen your union. And we want to work with you to make sure that every person can enjoy the dignity that comes from work – whether they live in Chicago or Cleveland or Belfast or Berlin, in Athens or Madrid, everybody deserves opportunity. We have to have economies that are working for all people, not just those at the very top. Peace with justice means extending a hand to those who reach for freedom, wherever they live. Different peoples and cultures will follow their own path, but we must reject the lie that those who live in distant places don't yearn for freedom and self-determination just like we do; that they don't somehow yearn for dignity and rule of law just like we do. We cannot dictate the pace of change in places like the Arab world, but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it. We cannot shrink from our role of advancing the values we believe in – whether it's supporting Afghans as they take responsibility for their future, or working for an Israeli-Palestinian peace – or engaging as we've done in Burma to help create space for brave people to emerge from decades of dictatorship. In this century, these are the citizens who long to join the free world. They are who you were. They deserve our support, for they too, in their own way, are citizens of Berlin. And we have to help them every day. Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons – no matter how distant that dream may be. And so, as President, I've strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduced the number and role of America's nuclear weapons. Because of the New START Treaty, we're on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s. But we have more work to do. So today, I'm announcing additional steps forward. After a comprehensive review, I've determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies, and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent, while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third. And I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures. At the same time, we'll work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe. And we can forge a new international framework for peaceful nuclear power, and reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking. America will host a summit in 2016 to continue our efforts to secure nuclear materials around the world, and we will work to build support in the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and call on all nations to begin negotiations on a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. These are steps we can take to create a world of peace with justice. Peace with justice means refusing to condemn our children to a harsher, less hospitable planet. The effort to slow climate change requires bold action. And on this, Germany and Europe have led. In the United States, we have recently doubled our renewable energy from clean sources like wind and solar power. We're doubling fuel efficiency on our cars Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down. But we know we have to do more -- and we will do more. With a global middle class consuming more energy every day, this must now be an effort of all nations, not just some. For the grim alternative affects all nations – more severe storms, more famine and floods, new waves of refugees, coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise. This is the future we must avert. This is the global threat of our time. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. That is our job. That is our task. We have to get to work. Peace with justice means meeting our moral obligations. And we have a moral obligation and a profound interest in helping lift the impoverished corners of the world. By promoting growth so we spare a child born today a lifetime of extreme poverty. By investing in agriculture, so we aren't just sending food, but also teaching farmers to grow food. By strengthening public health, so we're not just sending medicine, but training doctors and nurses who will help end the outrage of children dying from preventable diseases. Making sure that we do everything we can to realize the promise – an achievable promise – of the first AIDS-free generation. That is something that is possible if we feel a sufficient sense of urgency. Our efforts have to be about more than just charity. They're about new models of empowering people – to build institutions; to abandon the rot of corruption; to create ties of trade, not just aid, both with the West and among the nations they're seeking to rise and increase their capacity. Because when they succeed, we will be more successful as well. Our fates are linked, and we cannot ignore those who are yearning not only for freedom but also prosperity. And finally, let's remember that peace with justice depends on our ability to sustain both the security of our societies and the openness that defines them. Threats to freedom don't merely come from the outside. They can emerge from within – from our own fears, from the disengagement of our citizens. For over a decade, America has been at war. Yet much has now changed over the five years since I last spoke here in Berlin. The Iraq war is now over. The Afghan war is coming to an end. Osama bin Laden is no more. Our efforts against al Qaeda are evolving. And given these changes, last month, I spoke about America's efforts against terrorism. And I drew inspiration from one of our founding fathers, James Madison, who wrote, \"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\" James Madison is right – which is why, even as we remain vigilant about the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond a mindset of perpetual war. And in America, that means redoubling our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo. It means tightly controlling our use of new technologies like drones. It means balancing the pursuit of security with the protection of privacy. And I'm confident that that balance can be struck. I'm confident of that, and I'm confident that working with Germany, we can keep each other safe while at the same time maintaining those essential values for which we fought for. Our current programs are bound by the rule of law, and they're focused on threats to our security – not the communications of ordinary persons. They help confront real dangers, and they keep people safe here in the United States and here in Europe. But we must accept the challenge that all of us in democratic governments face: to listen to the voices who disagree with us; to have an open debate about how we use our powers and how we must constrain them; and to always remember that government exists to serve the power of the individual, and not the other way around. That's what makes us who we are, and that's what makes us different from those on the other side of the wall. That is how we'll stay true to our better history while reaching for the day of peace and justice that is to come. These are the beliefs that guide us, the values that inspire us, the principles that bind us together as free peoples who still believe the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr – that \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" And we should ask, should anyone ask if our generation has the courage to meet these tests? If anybody asks if President Kennedy's words ring true today, let them come to Berlin, for here they will find the people who emerged from the ruins of war to reap the blessings of peace; from the pain of division to the joy of reunification. And here, they will recall how people trapped behind a wall braved bullets, and jumped barbed wire, and dashed across minefields, and dug through tunnels, and leapt from buildings, and swam across the Spree to claim their most basic right of freedom. The wall belongs to history. But we have history to make as well. And the heroes that came before us now call to us to live up to those highest ideals – to care for the young people who can't find a job in our own countries, and the girls who aren't allowed to go to school overseas; to be vigilant in safeguarding our own freedoms, but also to extend a hand to those who are reaching for freedom abroad. This is the lesson of the ages. This is the spirit of Berlin. And the greatest tribute that we can pay to those who came before us is by carrying on their work to pursue peace and justice not only in our countries but for all mankind. Vielen Dank. God bless you. God bless the peoples of Germany. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-inspector-report-reactors-all-clear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-18T14:51:54Z","webTitle":"Nuclear inspector accused of complacency as he gives reactors get all-clear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-inspector-report-reactors-all-clear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/18/nuclear-inspector-report-reactors-all-clear","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear inspector accused of complacency after reactors get all-clear","bodyText":"An enormous row broke out on Wednesday after the chief nuclear safety inspector gave Britain's reactor fleet the all-clear and made modest \"recommendations\" to be incorporated in the planned new plant design. Critics immediately accused Mike Weightman of rushing to judgment and \"complacency\" in his interim report on the lessons to be learned from the Fukushima atomic crisis. The safety boss said there was no need to curtail the operations of atomic plants in Britain, given that conditions in Japan were so different, but wanted a review of backup power supplies, ventilation procedures and plant layout. \"We are not complacent. No matter what the differences are, and how high the standard of design and subsequent operation of the nuclear facilities here in the UK, the quest for improvement must never stop,\" Weightman argued. The chief nuclear inspector denied he was under political pressure to keep the atomic bandwagon rolling in Britain, and said energy companies would need to take on board his list of 26 recommendations. \"We are independent and do not operate under government auspices... We need to be open to the UK public,\" he argued. \"We are not just asking them [plant operators] to do things. We put the onus on the industry... Make no mistake: while I will seek reassurances from the industry, if I am not satisfied, they will not operate,\" he added. The interim report – to be followed by a fuller report in September, following Weightman's own visit to Japan, was demanded by the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, in the aftermath of the 9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that battered the Japanese coast and caused an explosion at a nuclear plant, leading to radioactive releases. Weightman's report was welcomed by Huhne, EDF, the French company at the forefront of plans to build new reactors, and the nuclear workers' union, Unite, but came under attack from Greenpeace and other nuclear sceptics. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, said the regulator's review of safety essentially concluded that the industry should go away and think about it. \"Many people will regard that as complacent, given the huge cost and misery inflicted by the Japanese accident, and this cannot inspire confidence in Britain's nuclear regulators. Even as the struggle to control Fukushima reactors continues, it appears Huhne has rushed to judgement on the safety of reactors to keep the timetable for new nuclear power on track,\" he added. Paul Dorfman, an academic and member of the Nuclear Consultation Group, said it was an \"outrage\" that conclusions on Fukushima had been made while facts from Japan remained so sketchy and the crisis was far from over. He added: \"There is really not enough information around yet to base any rational decisions on.\" But Weightman, insisting he could still amend the recommendations in his final report, concluded that it was \"not credible\" to expect a Japanese-style earthquake in the UK, and he pointed out that existing and planned nuclear power stations in this country were of a different design from those at Fukushima. Flooding risks were unlikely to prevent the construction of new nuclear power stations at potential development sites in the UK, all of which were on the coast, he added. The government is reviewing plans by EDF and others to develop a new suite of nuclear reactors on existing British sites to maintain electricity supplies and cut greenhouse gas emissions as power stations of an older generation are shut down. Huhne made it clear that the report paved the way for new reactors. \"I am pleased that today's report confirms that the UK's current safety arrangements are working. We want to see new nuclear as part of a low-carbon energy mix going forward, provided there is no public subsidy. The chief nuclear inspector's interim report reassures me that it can,\" he added. Unite, which represents 40,000 workers in energy and utilities, said the positive interim report from the UK's chief nuclear inspector was the green light for fast-tracking newbuild. \"The government must now publish its national energy policy statements without delay and get on with the job of creating the right environment for creating a low-carbon energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century,\" said Kevin Coyne, Unite's national officer for energy. \"This includes commissioning the first newbuild nuclear power station for a generation at Hinkley Point.\" On Tuesday, Germany's environment minister, Norbert Röttgen, said the results of post-Fukushima safety checks on its nuclear reactors showed there was no need to switch plants off now. Röttgen said there was \"no argument to say that we must get out of [nuclear power] in a hurry, overnight for safety reasons.\" But he added that Germany was committed to phasing out nuclear, as announced by chancellor Angela Merkel in March: \"It remains the case that we should find a way to give up nuclear energy as soon as is sensible,\" he said. The end was approaching for Germany's seven oldest nuclear plants, because they would not be able to withstand a large plane crash he said. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, said last week that the country was starting from scratch on its energy policy and was likely to abandon plans to increase the amount of Japan's electricity provided by nuclear from the existing 30% to 50%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/22/germany-nuclear-uk-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-22T12:02:02Z","webTitle":"Germany's nuclear phase-out will cause UK emissions to fall, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/22/germany-nuclear-uk-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/22/germany-nuclear-uk-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Germany's nuclear phase-out will cause UK emissions to fall, report says","bodyText":"The UK's greenhouse gas emissions are likely to fall and the cost of carbon emissions for industry will rise as a result of Germany's decision to shut down its nuclear power plants, a new analysis has shown. Germany's own carbon emissions will rise, because the phase-out of nuclear power between now and 2022 will force an increased reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal and gas. But this in turn is likely to push up the price of carbon permits within the European Union's emissions trading scheme – by about €5 (£4.60) a tonne, according to research to be published on Wednesday by Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, an analyst company. If that happens, generators in many countries will switch from coal-fired power generation to gas, which produces less carbon, predicts Daniel Jefferson, author of the research. \"German nuclear closures will put pressure on the carbon price,\" he told the Guardian. \"That means it will be more economic to run gas [fired power plants] than coal.\" Current prices for EU carbon permits are about €15 a tonne. Jefferson said the UK, Spain and Italy were prime candidates to switch more generation from coal to an even greater reliance on gas. \"In those countries where there is scope for a fuel switch from coal to gas, that is what we would expect to see happen,\" he said. He said the use of renewables was also likely to increase as a result of the changes. Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power, over safety fears in the wake of the Fukushima incident in Japan was announced by chancellor Angela Merkel last month. The country plans to increase its use of renewables and push for greater energy efficiency, but its use of fossil fuel power is also likely to rise. Point Carbon estimates that the result will be an increase in German emissions of 493 megatonnes in total by 2020. Emissions will not rise overall across the EU because of Germany's decision, however, as under the EU emissions trading scheme there is an absolute cap on emissions from energy-intensive industry until 2020. But within Europe, countries where generators switch away from coal are likely to see their emissions dip. The EU's emissions trading scheme imposes a cap on the amount of carbon that can be emitted from heavy industry, including power generation. Under the scheme, companies are awarded a quota of permits, each representing a tonne of carbon dioxide, and if companies wish to emit more they must buy spares from cleaner companies. This is supposed to spur the take-up of clean technologies, and spur greater energy efficiency. In the case of fossil fuel generators, a higher price on carbon will make it more costly to burn coal, and encourage companies to switch to gas and renewables. Following the German decision to shut its nuclear plants, eight plants that were closed during the previous moratorium will remain permanently closed, and lifetime extensions for the remaining nine plants will be abandoned, with all reactors will be phased out by 2022. Point Carbon calculated that the eight plants that have been permanently closed amount to more than 8GW of generating capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/audio/2011/sep/12/science-weekly-podcast-dava-sobel","type":"audio","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-11T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Science Weekly podcast: Dava Sobel on Copernicus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2011/sep/12/science-weekly-podcast-dava-sobel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/audio/2011/sep/12/science-weekly-podcast-dava-sobel","fields":{"headline":"Science Weekly podcast: Dava Sobel on Copernicus","bodyText":"This week Alok Jha meets the historian Dava Sobel, author of the worldwide bestseller Longitude to discuss her latest adventure into science history A More Perfect Heaven, How Copernicus Revolutionized the Cosmos.

So much so that while the home markets of EnerNOC and Comverge (the two big US demand response companies) near saturation point, forcing them to look elsewhere for new business (including Europe), DR in Europe is only just beginning to get off the ground. Demand response is a process that can help maintain the supply-demand balance of energy on the grid without the need for costly, carbon-emitting peak power infrastructure. It does this by managing the consumption of energy on the customer side (that is, those participating in demand response programs) in response to the supply requirements of the grid. The potential for DR in Europe is thought to be comparable to the US. Currently, peak clipping capabilities are roughly estimated to be in the 5% to 11% range, depending on the profile of commercial/industrial and residential resources available in each market. This represents a huge opportunity for Europe's DR players – and their investors. These companies are not multimillion-market-cap public entities like their US counterparts, but small and venture-backed. Regulation, however, is standing in their way. So the threat of invading Americans isn't bothering them too much – not Oliver Stahl anyway. Stahl is the CEO of Entelios, a German company and one of the first to offer demand response programmes in Europe. Others include Kiwi Power and Flexitricity, both in the UK, and CyberGrid in Austria. Entelios is currently focused on the German commercial and industrial sector offering DR services to utilities and grid operators. Stahl says in terms of potential MW under management the sector represents – technically – around 8,000MW. That's equivalent to eight nuclear power stations. He says an additional 15,000MW are available in the residential sector, although this will be much harder to access. The extra capacity these markets can offer will be even more important to Germany now that it has announced it will close all of its nuclear power stations by 2022 and aims for 80% renewable energy by 2050. Stahl is at the forefront of the DR policy agenda in Europe and is one of founding members of the Smart Energy Demand Coalition (SEDC), a group of 45 utilities and energy-related companies campaigning for regulatory change. Together they represent more than 150 million end-use consumers. Obviously, the European commission is committed to implementing energy efficiency measures. Its proposed new energy efficiency directive aims to help the EU achieve its 20/20/20 objective: a 20% cut in emissions of greenhouse gases, compared with 1990 levels; a 20% increase in the share of renewables in the energy mix; and a 20% cut in energy consumption – by 2020. Stahl has his own: 20% of Europe's C&amp;I sector participating in DR programmes in some capacity by 2020, and he hopes the coalition's campaign will clear the path and open up the market. \"I can make revenues now,\" he told me at our recent energy efficiency-focused investment conference in London, \"but we can only realise the full potential of all energy reduction assets if we have a better regulatory framework.\" Stahl wants a European-wide action plan on demand response comparable to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's National Action Plan on Demand Response in the US. Currently in Europe, policy is written assuming that capacity is only provided by the generators and, consequently, tenders are written for them only, essentially blocking demand side resources from participating. They want policy-makers to recognise the demand side as a valuable resource which is able to participate in the balancing and/or capacity markets. The SEDC says that 20 out of 27 member states have residual historic regulation along these lines, inhibiting the development of DR across the C&amp;I and residential sectors. And although progress is being made, particularly in the UK, Ireland and France, local DR companies are still struggling to scale up. EnerNOC has been deploying an aggressive acquisition strategy to gain access to new markets. It hasn't bought up any Europeans yet but the company is now operating in the UK. Stahl says competitors help to build a market, and he has a couple of key advantages anyway: knowing EU-specific policies and the regulatory frameworks, industry networks and an ICT technology that is capable of controlling loads in a fully automated manner. In the US, DR is still quite often a manual process managed by phone. As one of Entelios' investors, Albert Fischer from Dutch venture capital firm Yellow &amp; Blue, said: \"Europe is already working to higher energy efficiency standards than many other regions, so we expect the best European technologies to attract wider attention as they mature.\" So even though the DR market in Europe has some catching up to do, the technology doesn't.

The Japanese authorities publish annual \"hazard maps\" to highlight parts of the country deemed at risk from major earthquakes, but there is no reliable scientific basis for the technique, the researcher said. Had the government considered global tremor activity and historical tsunami records instead, they would have appreciated the risk of a magnitude nine earthquake in the area and designed the Fukushima power plant to withstand such an event, said Robert Geller at the University of Tokyo. His comments were made as residents and business owners who were forced to leave their homes amid radiation fears on Wednesday demanded immediate damages from the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis. About 20 people who have been evacuated from areas near the Fukushima Daiichi plant protested outside the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) headquarters, calling for a quick decision on possible compensation. The company's president, Masataka Shimizu, apologised during a rare public appearance and said he would compensate the tens of thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted by the nuclear emergency. In an article in the journal Nature, Geller calls on Japan to scrap its system for predicting major earthquakes and make it clear to the public that the whole of the country is at risk from major tremors. \"They might have been forced into using a more expensive design than they could have afforded, but a lot of people might have appreciated that, especially the people in Fukushima who have been evacuated,\" Geller told the Guardian. \"If the cost was too much to design for, they would have had to go without the nuclear reactor.\" The government's faith in the system means some areas take precautions in anticipation of an emergency, while others are left woefully under-prepared, he said. \"It is a waste of time and money, but worse than that, if the public think you can predict earthquakes, it tends to lull them into a false sense of security. Because of the limitations of our knowledge and data, we really cannot do more than say the whole place is dangerous,\" Geller said. In 1978, the Japanese government enacted a law that effectively requires the national meteorological agency to run an earthquake detection system capable of providing an early warning of a long-feared but hypothetical earthquake in the Tokai district, 100 miles west of Tokyo. The programme led the government to publish maps annually that give a probability of major earthquakes across the country. But since 1979, every earthquake that caused 10 or more deaths has struck in regions claimed to be at low risk. Meanwhile, global records show there have been five subduction zone earthquakes of the kind possible near Japan that measured a magnitude nine or more in the past 100 years, and that large tsunamis have frequently battered the Tohoku region of the country where the Fukushima plant is situated. \"If global seismicity and the historical record in Tohoku had been used as the basis for estimating seismic hazards, the 11th March Tohoku earthquake could easily have been 'foreseen' in a general way, although not of course its particular time, epicentre or magnitude,\" Geller wrote. \"Countermeasures for dealing with such events could and should have been incorporated in the intial design of the Fukushima power plants,\" he added. The Fukushima nuclear power plant was crippled last month when the tsunami breached sea walls designed to protect the site and inundated basement buildings where generators were providing back-up power to the station. Japanese authorities have since admitted that the power plant was not designed to withstand such a major natural disaster. \"These decisions should have been made in a more transparent way. The public should have been clearly informed what were the risks, what design decisions had been made and so on. But the government took the stance that these things were completely safe, that there was no risk whatsoever,\" Geller said. This article was amended on 14th April. The original referred to concerns over a hypothetical earthquake in Tokai, 75 miles north of Tokyo. This has been corrected to Tokai district, 100 miles west of Tokyo."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-12T20:30:22Z","webTitle":"Radiation from Fukushima spreads, but threat to rest of world is low","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-nuclear-fukushima-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Radiation from Fukushima spreads, but threat to rest of world is low","bodyText":"Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima power plant has been carried around the world and far out to sea, adding to fear and confusion over the danger posed by the leaked material. Japanese officials have taken steps to evacuate residents from five villages outside the exclusion zone around the beleaguered plant, where the severity of the crisis was upgraded to the worst rating possible on an international nuclear disaster scale. The move, which comes as firefighters worked to extinguish a fire at a seawater sampling station at the plant, puts the incident at the crippled power station on a par with Chernobyl in 1986, the only previous nuclear disaster to be given the highest ranking. Michael Mariotte, head of the Nuclear Information Research Service, an advocacy organisation, said those living in the villages were leaving for good. \"The people are not being evacuated because of the threat of a large fast release, or releases that could cause acute symptoms. It is because radiation in these areas is too high to stay over the long term. It is not an evacuation per se. It is a permanent relocation. That is why they are not rushing it.\" The upgrading resulted in differing opinions from Japanese officials, with the Nuclear Safety Commission estimating the total amount of leaked radiation to be only one tenth of that released at Chernobyl. Meanwhile an official for Tepco, the utility company that runs the plant, admitted the radiation leak could eventually top that of the Ukrainian disaster. Monitoring stations around the globe have picked up small amounts of radioactive iodine and caesium that have carried on the wind from the power station and landed on the ground and in water courses, but the levels are considered far too low to be dangerous to human health. \"The releases into the atmosphere will travel around the world, but we have incredibly sensitive detection systems. If there had been a major release we would know about it,\" said Gerry Thomas, a molecular pathologist and director of the Chernobyl tissue bank at Imperial College London. \"They have re-evaluated the incident on the grounds that there has been leakage into the environment, but this is nothing like Chernobyl,\" she added. But measurements of radiation levels in Europe have led at least one group to raise concerns over safety. A French NGO, the Commission for Independent Research and Information on Radioactivity, said levels of radiation were no longer negligible, a claim Thomas dismissed as \"absolutely ridiculous\". Japan's location has helped lessen the effect of radiation from the damaged plant reaching other countries. The prevailing winds are westerlies, so the radioactive plume has typically blown out over the sea and had to cover thousands of miles before it reaches landfall in the US. Trace amounts of iodine-131 were discovered in drinking water in Idaho and Washington in the US last week, but were so low that the Environmental Protection Agency said an infant would have to drink around 7,000 litres to receive a radiation dose equivalent to one day's worth of natural background radiation. Other measurements of the air, drinking water, rainfall and milk have all been far below the levels for concern, according to the EPA. The most contaminated drinking water clearly linked to Fukushima was found in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 28 March, but even in that case, an infant would need to drink 900 litres of the water to receive a dose of radiation they would normally receive in a day from living in the area. The direction of the wind currents mean the radioactive plume has had to blow the long way around the world to reach the UK, covering thousands more miles along the way. In Britain, the Health Protection Agency has begun publishing weekly updates that cover radiation in the air, on grass and in the water from sites around the country. The levels detected in the air last week gave a dose equivalent to roughly one ten thousandth of that received from natural background sources. According to the Met Office, a complex interplay of factors determine where the radiation goes and how soon it arrives, a situation being modelled continuously by the organisation, using the same computer tools that were brought to bear on the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud that brought air travel to a standstill last summer. The Met Office simulations feed into the Cobra emergency committee and the chief scientist's Science and Engineering Advice in Emergencies group and are shared internationally with the IAEA and other meteorological offices that are working to track the spread of the radiation. The danger posed by the airborne plume falls with time and distance from the power plant. Unlike the Chernobyl disaster, which saw vast amounts of highly radioactive material blasted high into the atmosphere, the airborne leaks from Fukushima have been low down, where the air mixes quickly and wind speeds are relatively low. As the plume moves out over the ocean it becomes steadily more dispersed. At the same time, the radiation ebbs as the contamination decays. This is more significant for some elements than others. Iodine-131 halves in radioactivity every eight days, leaving more long-lived radioactive substances behind, such as caesium-137. Computer models of the marine environment show the large amounts of radioactive water that escaped into the sea from Fukushima drifted south along the coast of Japan before being caught in one of the largest warm water currents on the planet, the Kuroshio, which drives out to sea at a rate of 75 miles a day. Simulations created by ASR Ltd, an international marine consulting firm, suggest that water leaking from Fukushima would have swept many hundreds of miles out to sea in the past few weeks, spreading out and dispersing in huge eddies. The Kuroshio is comparable to the Gulf Stream that warms western Europe and takes the form of a 70-mile wide body of water that pushes almost directly east from Japan into the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. \"As soon as the plume gets entrained in the Korushio current, it gets shot out into the Pacific, but it is unlikely to have reached any other countries. It is still out in the Pacific and being diluted rapidly,\" said Jose Borrero, a consulting oceanographer who worked on the model."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/28/windfarms-and-pylons-opposition-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Opposition groups kick up storm over windfarms in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/windfarms-and-pylons-opposition-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/28/windfarms-and-pylons-opposition-wales","fields":{"headline":"Opposition groups kick up storm over windfarms in Wales","bodyText":"Opposition to wind power in rural Wales is said to be \"total\", with communities threatening peaceful direct action and at least 20 groups fighting plans for 870 of the largest turbines in Powys alone. \"It's only in the last few months that people have begun to understand the scale of what is happening. Even the business community is shocked. We can call on at least 5,000 people now for meetings,\" said Richard Bonfield, former chair of mid-Wales Confederation of British Industry (CBI), who has helped organise protest rallies at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff and elsewhere. \"This is one of Wales's biggest ever infrastructural projects and no one is now in favour except a few farmers. In the past we had a few small farms and turbines: we could accept them. But now we're talking 120-metre-tall turbines and giant pylons. It is an environmental disaster.\" According to protesters, it is the applications by the National Grid company to build a 7.5-hectare (19-acre) substation at Abermule to link several major new windfarms in mid-Wales to the grid, and plans to erect possibly 25 miles of 46-metre, 400,000v pylons across lowland areas of Powys, Shropshire and Snowdonia, that have done the most to inflame passions. \"The pylons have made people sit up. A few years ago it was really only the people who could see the farms who were in opposition. It has now broadened out as people see the true scale of the developments,\" said Caroline Evans, of the Brechfa Forest Energy Action Group near Carmarthen. She expects her village to be surrounded by four windfarms and dozens of pylons: \"Everyone is now affected. People are very fed up.\" Anger in mid-Wales at pylons and farms has spread north to Snowdonia and Anglesey, where hundreds of people have packed recent meetings called by protest groups to debate applications for more than 50 turbines. Glyn Davies, the Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, was heavily criticised last year for backing a Welsh anti-pylons direct action group. He said the entire region was now \"up in arms\" against the pylon and turbine plans. \"They will industrialise the uplands with wind turbines and desecrate our valleys with hideous cables and pylons. The scale is almost impossible to comprehend,\" he said. National Grid says it will need to erect a 15-mile row of Britain's biggest pylons to connect a huge offshore windfarm off Anglesey to the grid, as well as a second nuclear reactor at Wylfa. Another line of pylons will be needed to Trawsfynydd. \"No one knows the full implications of these developments or what they will do to tourism. The opposition is total and very impressive,\" said Welshpool campaigner Richard Jones. \"I was broadly in favour of wind power until I saw the scale of the pylon developments.\" According to National Grid, 215 miles of the largest 400,000v pylons will be needed by 2020 in England and Wales, as well as new sub-sea cables down the east and west coasts of England and others linking Scottish islands. The new 400,000v pylon lines will affect Kent, Lincolnshire, East Anglia and Somerset as well as Wales. Tens of thousands of people opposed giant pylon plans now being erected through Scotland. David Mercer, National Grid's head of major infrastructure, said hundreds of miles of pylons erected in the 1960s would have to be replaced, possibly with bigger ones, to accommodate new windfarms as well as a generation of new nuclear power. \"We only build where we have to. We work very closely with communities, and have had umpteen forums. But it's hard to please everyone,\" said Mercer. \"Ultimately, society must decide what is appropriate to spend. It's not for us to decide whether the lines go above or below ground. In sensitive areas, it's likely to be a mix. If all 345km [215 miles] of new lines were to go on overhead cables, it is likely to cost £700m, but it could be £6bn if it were all to be buried. That has to be a decision for government. We are not trying to make a profit from this.\" New figures released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) expect the cost of adapting the grid to the new generation of nuclear and wind power to be £14bn between 2013 and 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2012/oct/11/wendell-berry-environmental-campaigner","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-11T15:36:58Z","webTitle":"A conversation with environmental campaigner Wendell Berry | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2012/oct/11/wendell-berry-environmental-campaigner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2012/oct/11/wendell-berry-environmental-campaigner","fields":{"headline":"A conversation with environmental campaigner Wendell Berry","bodyText":"Wendell Berry doesn't come to New York very often. The 78-year-old lives in Kentucky, where his family has farmed for five generations. When he flies to the city next week, it's to collect a Leadership Award from the James Beard Foundation for over half a century of campaigning for better methods of food production. During his career, Berry has demonstrated against everything from Vietnam to nuclear power, from mountain-top coal mining to the death penalty. Most famously, he has campaigned against what he sees as bad farming methods, particularly industrialized farming. \"I'm a writer more than I am a talker,\" he says when I call him prior to his trip. In a life of extraordinary productivity, as well as his campaigning, Berry has authored more than 40 books of fiction, poetry and essays – he is most frequently compared to William Faulkner. And, in 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal. Berry is still a committed activist, arguing these days for a 50-Year Farm Bill to address such deeply unfashionable issues as soil degradation and sustainable agriculture. Here are some of his thoughts on the state of the environment, and how the US, at any given moment, is nearer to a food crisis than most people imagine. EB: Did you see Roger Cohen's very hostile New York Times op-ed piece about organic food last month? WB: Yes. EB: He called it the \"the romantic back-to-nature obsession of an upper middle class able to afford it.\" I'd love to know your response to that. WB: All right. Well, organic has never been a word I have willingly used. My label is just \"good farming\", which isn't something you can put on a t-shirt. My objection to organic is that it has always been defined negatively. That is, in terms of things that you don't do. And I think good agriculture is always going to be defined in terms of things you do do: you make the farm provide as much of its own fertility and operating energy as you can. If you have an organic monoculture of several thousand acres, as I think some California vineyards have, and you're importing all of the fertility, then that's not good farming. I don't care how organic it is. EB: And the accusation of elitism? WB: That calls for a lot of careful criticism. If we can't afford to take good care of the land that feeds us, we're in an insurmountable mess. And at present, we're not affording it. Cheap food is a great accomplishment of industrialization, but I think Michael Pollan makes a very good point: that if people eat healthy food, they will save enough to compensate for the food price being healthier and spending less on healthcare, so-called. For people just to wave good agriculture away as something only an elite can afford – as if it were some kind of a prissy fashion – is just missing the whole point. EB: That's how the organic movement came to be regarded by its critics: as a lifestyle choice. WB: Industrialization advances on the same theme. If you don't have the latest technology, you're out of it. It's largely fashion. The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology. EB: How do you get consumers to give more thought to what they're buying in the supermarket? At the end of a long day, that can be a tough sell. WB: They think the way they breathe: they just take in whatever's handiest. Well, this effort I've been involved in all these years has a couple of questions hanging over it. So, you know there's not a mountainous pile of food anywhere that people can draw on if production fails for some reason? Food has to be kept coming; it's more analogous to the flow of blood in our body than to a large bank account that can be drawn upon in an emergency, or an insurance policy. It has to be kept coming. We know how quickly famine could happen in the cities, where people are helpless to do anything for themselves. Look at Phoenix, for instance; a large city in the desert where all the things they need are going to have to be trucked to them. Suppose that became difficult or impossible? People can be persuaded very quickly if there are shortages. Hunger is a powerful persuader if it happens, and it's conceivable that it could happen. Country people have always known this. I'm not exactly dodging your question on how do you persuade consumers: I'm saying that people are persuadable. Persuasion works. Whether it's working fast enough, we don't know. We have to do it because we know it's right. I tell the young: you can't get into this on the assumption that you're going to win, even in your lifetime. You have to get into it because you know it's right and have all the fun you can while you work. EB: You can actually envisage severe food shortages occurring in this country? Because farming methods are exhausting the resources? WB: Yes. People sit around out here in the country and say, what are people going to eat? There's a letter in my local newspaper this morning from a dairy farmer's wife, writing in to say what do people think is going to happen to us? We're buying stuff on an inflated market, and selling our milk for what we sold it four years ago. People like that find it very easy to ask: what are people going to do when we're all gone? We don't know what's going to happen in the future. I'm only saying that we have finite supplies from a finite acreage that we are abusing by erosion, toxicity and so on. And a finite number of producers we are abusing, and there are fewer of them all the time – fewer than 1% in this country. Their vote doesn't matter to anybody. EB: What would you like the role of government to be in all of this? WB: I'd like to see the subsidies to big industrial agriculture stop. The government could make soil conservation a priority, which would act as a kind of permission-giver to people to take it seriously. No one is talking about the land economy at all. The economists I read in the newspapers and magazines: it never occurs to them to speak of it. Paul Krugman, for instance, thinks that the economy is the same thing as the financial system. And he couldn't be more wrong. So, the first thing people have to do is examine their own economies and see how little control they have over it in terms of quantity and quality. The next thing is, you've got to change the standard. The industrial standards are productivity and profitability. And people like Sir Albert Howard [English botanist and organic farming pioneer], J Russell Smith and Liberty Hyde Bailey said, on good scientific grounds, that the standard has to be ecological. The standard has to be health. To put it in more practical terms: you have to use the land in a way that doesn't do more permanent damage to the local ecosystem. EB: I think that, for many, the assumption is that the only way to provide enough food for a country this size is through industrial methods. WB: But that's exploiting ignorance. Plus, you have the reluctance of the genetic engineers to label food. They need people to be ignorant. EB: How would you change labeling laws in the US? WB: If a manufactured food or even a singular food product has genetic engineering involved in its production, then there ought to be a label that says so. That's not too hard. There's a terrific fight in this country to keep that from happening. And this is simply an acknowledgement that we want the consumer to be ignorant. EB: Has Obama had a sympathetic ear to these arguments? WB: Well, in the political climate that we now have, nobody is going to put soil conservation or the land economy at the top of their list. If Obama did that now, he'd go down as a kook. He could do it if he gets elected again. But what we need is politicians who are willing to educate the public, even at the cost of losing an election. EB: Has Michelle Obama's White House garden had some symbolic value? WB: Oh, yes, I think that has some symbolic value and some force. She's given that conversation a public status that it didn't have before. She's helped. There's no question of that. That little old garden up there on the White House lawn has some authentic historical significance, probably. She's come out for physical health. She can do that because she's not running for office. I imagine her husband has to distance himself from that. We wrap up the conversation and I ask Berry for his email address, to which he replies, \"I don't have a computer. I have a solar collector; three panels,\" and laughs loudly. He is honoured to be receiving the James Beard Foundation award, he says, but the city can be a chore. He really does prefer to go his own way. \"I can't hear,\" he says, \"in the midst of a crowd.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/16/japan-fukushima-lessons-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T21:44:43Z","webTitle":"Lessons for Japan from the Chernobyl catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/16/japan-fukushima-lessons-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/16/japan-fukushima-lessons-chernobyl","fields":{"headline":"Lessons for Japan from the Chernobyl catastrophe","bodyText":"The worsening crisis at the Fukushima power station in Japan has led to inevitable comparisons with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster that killed workers at the plant instantly, caused cancers in the surrounding population and spread radioactive contamination so far that livestock restrictions are still in place at some farms around the UK. The situation at Fukushima – which the French nuclear agency estimates to be a level six \"serious accident\" (two up from the one at Three Mile Island in 1979) – is certainly grave and immediately dangerous for those at the site who are fighting to make the crippled reactors and fuel storage ponds safe. But whatever warnings are now being issued by foreign governments to their citizens in Japan, there are significant differences that set this apart from the catastrophe in Ukraine, even as the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned that a pool of spent fuel rods at Fukushima had boiled dry. At Chernobyl the nuclear reactor exploded after a surge in power that blew the top off the power plant and sent hot fuel – and importantly, its more radioactive fission products – high into the upper atmosphere, where it floated across national borders. A fire that broke out in the graphite core forced more radioactive material into the air, helping it spread further. The reactor had no containment facility to even slow the release of radiation from the plant. The Fukushima boiling water reactor is a 40-year-old power plant and it has some glaring design flaws, but the reactors have been switched off for five days, so there is less fresh radioactive material around, and each core is contained within a 20cm-thick steel container, which is then protected by a steel-lined reinforced concrete outer structure. Even in the case of a meltdown, these measures should at least limit the amount of radiation released. The engineers at the site are working in swift changeover shifts to limit their own exposure to radiation. After a peak in radioactivity during the release of steam from the plant this week, one worker received a radiation dose of 106 millisieverts, according to Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. That is a dangerous level, but the dose corresponds to less than a 1% risk of fatal cancer in the worker's lifetime, said Richard Wakeford, an expert in radiation epidemiology at the Dalton Nuclear Institute at Manchester University. But what of the population beyond? The risk from radiation falls off substantially with distance. The authorities have already imposed an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the power station, introduced food bans and dispensed potassium iodide pills to those in the surrounding area. Those pills are to be taken only if a major leak of radiation spills out from the plant and reaches people at high levels. The radiation is lower at a distance because the particles become dispersed and their radioactivity continues to fall. Radiation levels have already risen above background levels in Tokyo and the US navy has measured higher levels off the coast, but these are far below the levels that can harm health. Any danger ahead will come from a major and sustained release of radiation. There are a number of disaster scenarios that the authorities must contend with that could produce a severe radiation leak. The most obvious is that one or more of the reactors goes into meltdown. That can occur if the fuel rods in the core are not cooled enough, and the rods and surrounding cladding melt. Because this molten material forms a blob it is much harder to cool than when the rods are spaced apart, so it can heat up further and ultimately melt through the bottom of the reactor vessel. If it then causes an explosion and ruptures the secondary containment, it can release radiation into the environment. The latest nuclear power reactors due to be built in Britain have a built in \"core-catcher\" that comprises a chute down which the molten core flows until it reaches a reservoir in the ground, said Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Institute. Another doomsday scenario – and one the engineers are battling now – is that one or more of the huge water pools used to store spent fuel boils dry, exposing the fuel rods to the atmosphere where they catch fire. These fuel rods are heavily contaminated with radioactive fission products that could be released directly into the air. If either of these happens, more radioactive material will be spewed out of the power station without doubt. At the site, the greatest danger would be from short-lived products of the fission reactions that fizzle out quickly in a burst of gamma rays. These burn out so fast that they are not a major problem further afield. \"As time goes by, much of the early short-lived radioactivity dies away and you're in a much happier position,\" said Wakeford. Any explosion could launch uranium and plutonium fuel – the latter from reactor 3 – into the air. These would remain as particles and would settle near the plant. They are grim environmental contaminants, and could see vast areas ruled out of bounds, but they are only a serious problem to people if they are ingested or inhaled. For the more distant population, the most serious radioactive substances that would be released are caesium-137 and iodine-131. These are extremely volatile, so can be carried a long way. But dangerous doses are not likely to travel far on the wind. \"Unless you're right next to the plant, the vast amount of the dose would be from what you eat and drink,\" said Neil Crout, who models environmental contaminants at the University of Nottingham. The danger comes when radioactive iodine and caesium rain down on the ground, on pastureland, for example, and livestock eat it. Cows concentrate radioactive iodine in their milk. Radioactive caesium accumulates in muscles, and in the past has built up in grazing sheep. The threat to humans then comes from drinking milk and eating contaminated meat. Both can raise the risk of cancer – iodine especially by being absorbed into children's thyroid glands. The iodine pills work by flooding the thyroid with stable iodine so the gland cannot absorb the radioactive form. \"The principal concern the authorities are worrying about, and it is why they have evacuated the area, why they are banning food stuffs, and why they are issuing stable iodine tablets, is that if there is a serious release, you have radioactive iodine. We know from Chernobyl that you've got to limit the dose to the thyroid glands of young children,\" said Wakeford. A recent report from the UN's scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation found that a rise in thyroid cancer was the only substantial medical legacy of Chernobyl in the general population. \"What happened at Chernobyl, which was a much more serious accident than this, was that the local Soviet authorities were in denial, they didn't get people out of the area, they didn't evacuate quickly enough, and they allowed children to continue to drink heavily contaminated milk, and as a consequence, many children received high doses of radiation, a sievert and greater, to the thyroid and we've seen thousands of thyroid cancers as a consequence,\" Wakeford said. \"In 1957 radioiodine was released in the Windscale fire in Cumbria . They monitored it and tipped the milk away. If they had done that at Chernobyl they could have prevented much of the problem.\" • This article was amended on 17 March 2011 to correct a misspelling of Neil Crout's name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/may/12/nuclear-japan-frugal-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-12T10:41:23Z","webTitle":"How nuclear disaster forced Japan to be frugal with energy | Jonathan Watts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/may/12/nuclear-japan-frugal-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/may/12/nuclear-japan-frugal-energy","fields":{"headline":"How nuclear disaster forced Japan to be frugal with energy","bodyText":"Japan's decision not to build more nuclear reactors is understandable given the explosions and leaks at the Fukushima power plant. But how will the country make up the massive energy shortfall? Prime minister Naoto Kan says supply can be sustained by investing more in renewables like wind, solar and geothermal. But there is a far simpler, cheaper and cleaner solution: use less power. As I learned on a trip to Tokyo and Tohoku last week, this is already happening. In the wake of a disaster that knocked out six reactors, Japan's businesses and people have been forced to scale back their electricity consumption. To conserve power, the utilities scheduled rolling power cuts, but many have not been necessary because considerable energy has been saved simply by promoting frugality. In shopping malls and stations, many automatic doors and escalators have been switched off, which means – shock, horror – that people are forced to push open doors and walk up stairs (there are still elevators for wheelchairs). In several places, neon signs and restaurant lights have been dimmed from their normal blazing levels. (I recall one of the first Japanese textbooks I used in the 1990s boasting the country's eateries had the brightest lighting in the world, which was apparently a sign of modernity). In the places I dined this time, the lower wattage created a mood that was moody rather than gloomy. Convenience stories – which do not usually close for even a minute a year – have scaled back business hours so they do not burn as much energy through the quiet night hours. Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara has joined criticism of the country's 5.5m vending machines, which use several nuclear reactors' worth of electricity to keep soft drinks refrigerated and coffee hot twenty-four hours a day. He said they may be switched off in the summer, when hundreds of millions of air conditioners put peak pressure on the grid. Several Japanese friends entered the spirit of conservation by not leaving the television on in the background, switching off lights in empty rooms and wearing extra layers of clothing rather than turning up the dial on the heating. All basic stuff, but the results are impressive. One woman I met estimated her monthly electricity bill had fallen to 11,000 yen, compared to 18,000 during the same period last year. \"This disaster has given us a better understanding of electricity use,\" office worker, Aki Taniguchi told me.\"Japanese people have grown accustomed to a convenient life of vending machines and 24-hour stores, but I now feel that was not real.\" It remains to be seen whether such fragality is a blip or a trend. Japan tightened its energy belt during the oil shocks of the 1970s and then – thanks largely to nuclear power – returned to a path of ever greater electricity consumption, albeit used more efficiently than in Europe, the US or China. There will be a partial return to normality, but my guess is the cuts this time will be longer lasting. In Fukushima, many people have turned against nuclear power, which has ruined their livelihoods. Renewables might make up the gap, but that will need time, land and money that Japan will struggle to find after a disaster and an economic crisis. While my colleagues, George Monbiot and Damian Carrington have discussed which forms of energy are most desirable, I think Japan's disaster should also prompt us to look more closely at how much energy we use. In a previous blogpost, I have speculated that we are in or approaching the era of \"Peak Human\", with regards to the size of our population and consumption of resources, after which both will fall back to sustainable levels. That could still lead to qualitative improvements in our lives, but most of us are reluctant to accept quantative limits. Disasters, such as the one at Fukushima, remind us we may not have a choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jul/01/fukushima-emails-government-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-01T12:30:01Z","webTitle":"Fukushima spin was Orwellian | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/01/fukushima-emails-government-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/01/fukushima-emails-government-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima spin was Orwellian","bodyText":"It was an open secret that Britain's decision to back nuclear power in 2006 was pushed through government by a cosy group of industrialists and others close to Tony Blair, and that a full debate about the full costs, safety and potential impact on future generations was suppressed. But the release of 80 emails showing that in the days after the Fukushima accident not one but two government departments were working with nuclear companies to spin one of the biggest industrial catastrophes of the last 50 years, even as people were dying and a vast area was being made uninhabitable, is shocking. What the emails shows is a weak government, captured by a powerful industry colluding to at least misinform and very probably lie to the public and the media. When the emails were sent, no one, least of all the industry and its friends in and out of government, had any idea how serious the situation at Fukushima was or might become. For the business department to then argue that \"we really need to show the safety of nuclear\" and that \"it's not as bad as it looks\", is shameless. But to argue that the radiation was being released deliberately and was \"all part of the safety systems to control and manage a situation\" is Orwellian. An ignorant government that relies for its information on companies it is planning to reward with contracts for billions of pounds smacks of corruption. These guys were not just cosy. They were naked, in bed and consenting. Their closeness now raises questions such as what influence could the industry have had on the chief nuclear inspector's report on Fukushima, and whether speeches by David Cameron, Chris Huhne and other ministers were informed or even written by the industry. Can we ever trust government to tell us the truth on nuclear power, or should we just accept that the industry and government are now as one. Until now the players in this drama must have been reasonably happy with the way the debate in Britain has gone. While the public has marginally shifted its position against nuclear power, little serious pressure has been put on the coalition. Unlike in Germany, Switzerland, Italy and many other countries, where the debate has been furious and governments have clearly had to think again, here the industry and its friends have managed to narrow the debate down to one about the medical safety of radiation and the impossibility of Britain being hit by a tsunami. There has been no major debate on nuclear costs, the legacy or the waste – which is just how government and industry wants it. Instead, the news from Japan gets worse by the day. Tepco, the nuclear company which owns Fukushima, has admitted that the accident may release more radioactive material into the environment than Chernobyl; an area of around 966 square kilometres near the power station is now probably uninhabitable for generations; there is a strong likelihood that children living in or near Fukushima were exposed to radiation internally; the costs run possibly to hundreds of billions of dollars. We now know Fukushima was on the same scale as Chernobyl, and likely to be the most expensive accident in the history of industrial accidents. Yet industry and government here want to dismiss it as \"not as bad is it looks\". Much more than the facts coming out of Japan, the emails now make the situation far worse for the industry caught with government trying to manipulate the truth. • This article was amended at 17:18 on 1 July 2011.

The history of atomic power has always been one of huge costs overruns, massive government bailouts and the running problem of what to do with the toxic waste – in other words, it is the history of taxpayers handing over cash to giant nuclear companies. The atomic lobby sometimes tries to pass off this woeful track record as ancient history, but it is not – just ask the Finns. A nuclear reactor was meant to open on the Finnish island of Olkiluoto this summer, but – after four years of building, countless defects and at least a €2bn rise in the original costs – the thing will not be working until 2012 at the earliest. Remind us, what is the Finnish for \"trebles all round\"? The company building the Finnish reactor, Areva, plans to set up at least four of them in the UK. As if that thought were not cheering enough, Lord Mandelson's officials have already promised Areva, EDF Energy and the other nuclear power firms that they will get a public subsidy. This flies in the face of ministers' public assurances, and shows up all those attempts (by politicians and energy companies alike) to justify what Gordon Brown terms the \"nuclear renaissance\" on economic grounds as so much wishful thinking. If ministers want to make an honest case for the adoption of nuclear power, they will have to simply admit that it will cost a fortune, much of which will be borne by the consumers. Indeed, so will energy from offshore wind farms, clean coal (whenever that arrives) and any other form of low-carbon power. Businesses do not tend to build large, expensive bits of infrastructure that will take a long time to make back their investment without some form of upfront inducement. And unless carbon prices are raised, there is very little incentive for customers to be weaned off coal or gas. An honest case for nuclear would also admit that the alternatives are not tempting. The old nuclear and coal stations are shutting down, while renewable energy cannot yet produce a large and constant supply. And some of the most attractive sources of clean energy, such as wave, are decades away from being either big or dependable enough. It is right there, in that unhappy last resort, that nuclear power belongs. Combined with much greater energy efficiency and heavier investment in renewables and microgeneration, atomic power can play a part in meeting Britain's low-carbon energy needs. But this will be a costlier and riskier journey than politicians are currently willing to countenance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2012/mar/19/cameron-plan-improve-britain-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-19T13:37:44Z","webTitle":"Cameron faces battles on two fronts over infrastructure plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/19/cameron-plan-improve-britain-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/mar/19/cameron-plan-improve-britain-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Cameron faces battles on two fronts over infrastructure plans","bodyText":"David Cameron set the scene yesterday for battles with Tory traditionalists and Liberal Democrats by pledging to take bold action to build up Britain's infrastructure. In a sign of No 10's anxiety over accusations that it has struggled to promote growth, the prime minister pledged to tackle a \"failure of nerve\" by holding a consultation on whether to build a Thames estuary airport and to reform \"bureaucratic\" planning laws. The consultation on a \"Boris Island\" airport, which is a victory for Boris Johnson, the London mayor, raises the prospect of a general election clash between the Tories and Liberal Democrats in the south-east. The Lib Dems are standing by their general election manifesto pledge in which they said they would oppose \"any expansion\" of airports in the south-east. The prime minister is allowed under the terms of the coalition agreement to hold the consultation because the Tories and Lib Dems agreed only to rule out expansion of existing airports. The Tories could go into the next election with a commitment to build a new airport, though sources stressed that the prime minister had an open mind. In his speech, the prime minister cited the consultation as an example of his bold thinking on building up Britain's infrastructure. \"We need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel. Not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai. Yes, this will be controversial. We will need to take decisions for the long term.\" He also confirmed that he would publish a new national planning policy framework that would lead to the biggest simplification in 60 years of \"bureaucratic, top-down planning laws\". The National Trust and the Daily Telegraph have been running a campaign against the planning reforms on the grounds that they will undermine the green belt. Cameron said: \"We must get our planning system fit for purpose. It needs to be quick. It needs to be easier to use. And it needs to better support growth, jobs and homes.\" Cameron set out his plans to rejuvenate Britain's infrastructure in a speech at the Institution of Civil Engineers in which he confirmed that the government was looking to invite sovereign wealth funds to lease trunk roads and motorways in England. This would be modelled on the funding system for water mains and sewerage, which has led to improvements. But Cameron insisted no tolls would be introduced on existing capacity. \"This is not about mass tolling – and as I've said, we're not tolling existing roads,\" he said. \"It's about getting more out of the money that motorists already pay.\" He said the time had arrived to strengthen and rebuild Britain's infrastructure as he invoked the memory of Victorian pioneers. \"We are falling behind our competitors,\" he said. \"And falling behind the great, world-beating, pioneering tradition set by those who came before us. There is now an urgent need to repair the decades-long degradation of our national infrastructure and to build for the future with as much confidence and ambition as the Victorians once did. \"Our national heroes include men of iron and steam like Brunel, Stephenson and Telford – all commemorated in Westminster Abbey alongside former prime ministers and great authors like Charles Dickens. Our inheritance includes daring bridges and soaring stations – structures built with Victorian swagger and intended to last like Norman castles.\" The prime minister promised to \"blast through the vested interests and bureaucratic hurdles\" as he said he would: • Work with the private sector to replace Britain's nine nuclear power plants, which are due to come to the end of their lives between now and 2030. There will be no state subsidy. • Ensure that 90% of properties have access to high-speed broadband by 2015. The remaining \"hard-to-reach\" properties will have at least \"functional broadband\" of two megabits per second. George Osborne, the chancellor, will announce 10 \"superconnected cities\" with access to 100Mb broadband. • Auction the 4G network to ensure that it covers 99% of the population. The prime minister said he was braced for protests. \"I'm not dogmatic about this. There will be costs and protests. And I am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage. I can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already.\"But rather than give in we should ask instead: what is it that people want for the future? Reasonable things. A decent home. A clean environment. Jobs for their children. The ability to get around without hassle, huge costs or endless jams. And then we should take the necessary steps to make these things a reality, not leave future generations to deal with the consequences of our cowardice.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-17T10:47:26Z","webTitle":"Charismatic outsider Toru Hashimoto tipped as future leader of Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader","fields":{"headline":"Charismatic outsider Toru Hashimoto tipped as future leader of Japan","bodyText":"Depending on who you ask, Toru Hashimoto is either a dangerous populist bent on returning Japan to its militarist past, or a charismatic radical leading a crusade to breathe life into the country's stagnant politics. Still in his early 40s, and with no experience of national office, Hashimoto is not only the most talked-about politician in Japan, he is now being tipped as its future leader. As mayor of Osaka, he has built a reputation for controversy, openness and a self-belief that has delivered stunning victories in local elections – qualities that could soon be tested on the national electorate. As the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, battles to keep his Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) intact after a recent defection by its largest faction, Hashimoto is priming as many as 300 hand-picked candidates to run in what some analysts expect will be a snap general election this year. \"The next election is our last chance to change Japan,\" Hashimoto said recently. \"If there are voices calling for Osaka's example to spread across Japan, [we] will respond firmly to those calls. Japan's old politics has to be swept away and a new politics built in its place.\" The established parties have much to fear from Hashimoto, who became mayor of Japan's second biggest city in December after three years as governor of Osaka prefecture. The prospects for an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa, the influential \"shadow shogun\" who left the DPJ to form a new party, have dimmed. But behind Ozawa is a queue of leaders from minor parties – as well as Tokyo's rightwing governor, Shintaro Ishihara – who are expected to consider a pact with Hashimoto's upstarts from Osaka. With his policies yet to be tested on the national stage, much of Hashimoto's appeal lies in his style and unconventional background. He was born in Tokyo, and after his parents divorced was raised by his mother in a poor district of Osaka, home to the buraku – an \"untouchable\" underclass – since the 17th century. He never knew his father, a member of the yakuza, who committed suicide after becoming indebted to underworld associates while his son was still young. Despite his origins, Hashimoto went on to study at Waseda, a prestigious private university in Tokyo, and became a familiar face on TV offering his views as a celebrity lawyer before entering politics. His Osaka Ishin no Kai (Osaka Restoration Group) party has positioned itself as an alternative to politics as usual which, after the appointment of six prime ministers in as many years – during which there have been only two elections – resembles a power-sharing agreement between a political elite with an unshakeable sense of entitlement. In style and substance, Hashimoto could not be more of a departure from that. Critics say his high-profile tussles with teachers' unions and his ban on public servants with tattoos are proof that he is an autocrat in the making. But from his power base in Osaka, a port city faced with huge debts, failing schools and the highest proportion of welfare recipients in the country, the 43-year-old has won over despondent voters with attacks on inept national politicians and calls for a more presidential style of leadership. His contempt for consensus building is matched by an enthusiasm for tearing up Japan's US-authored pacifist constitution, prompting one commentator to liken him to Hitler and nickname his movement \"Hashism\". After months of speculation, Hashimoto has said 200-300 Ishin no Kai members will run in the next general election, selected from 2,000 students at the political finishing school he opened in Osaka in March. \"Become warriors,\" he told them during a recent address. \"Let's fight together. Let's change Japan.\" As support slips away for the ruling and main opposition parties, Hashimoto and Ishin no Kai have a deep well of popular disillusion from which to draw. Nearly 80% of Japanese are dissatisfied with the direction the country is heading in, while 86% blame the government, according to a survey by the Pew Research Centre in Washington. Hashimoto has said he will not run for national office while he still has work to do as mayor, notably the merging of Osaka city and prefecture into a huge, Tokyo-like metropolis. But experts on the city's politics believe he may simply be biding his time. \"He probably won't run this time,\" says Yuji Yoshitomi, an Osaka-based journalist who has written a book about Hashimoto. \"But the problem for Ishin no Kai is that its popularity is entirely dependent on him.\" Yoshitomi believes Hashimoto may wait and see what kind of political arrangement emerges from the next election – which must be held by August 2013 – before deciding on his future. At the very least, a decent showing by Ishin no Kai – perhaps 60 out of 480 seats in the lower house – could be the catalyst for dramatic changes in Japan's political landscape. \"The DPJ is in trouble and the main opposition Liberal Democratic party [LDP] is in no fit state to fill the void, so the time is ripe for Ishin no Kai and other regional parties,\" Yoshitomi says. \"The next election could see the birth of a new kind of Japanese politicis.\" In the meantime, Hashimoto has launched attacks on the Tokyo political elite's dithering over everything from to nuclear power to tax increases. Instead, he envisages a \"grand reset\" he likens to Japan's transformation from a feudal to industrial economy 150 years ago. The postwar search for consensus, he says, has turned Japan into a democratic basketcase. \"Japan is a democracy but it can't make decisions,\" he said at a recent press conference. \"We have endless discussions and take on board everyone's opinion, but nothing ever comes of it.\" To achieve that change, he has proposed the abolition of the upper house of parliament, which can block legislation; direct elections for prime minister; and more powers for local government. \"Like the rise of extremist and nationalist parties of the right and left in Europe, Hashimoto derives his popularity from popular frustration with the established mainstream parties and the perceived failure of representative democracy,\" says Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"He offers oversimplified, authoritarian pseudo-answers, which don't really solve problems, but serve as an outlet for popular frustration with the existing political system.\" At times, Hashimoto sounds like Junichiro Koizumi, a former Japanese prime minister with hawkish views on defence who shares the mayor's enthusiasm for Thatcherite social policy. He wants to make it easier to revise Japan's constitution, which bans the use of force to settle disputes, a move that critics say would open the door to a more aggressive military amid mounting territorial friction with China. On welfare, he apes the conservative right in the US and Britain. \"Of course we have to support people who are absolutely unable to fend for themselves,\" he said. \"But the rest should be encouraged to stand on their own two feet.\" Nakano, however, sees a man willing to ditch his principles in his quest for Japan's highest office. \"He is not a Margaret Thatcher or even a Junichiro Koizumi,\" says Nakano. \"He seems less principled and more populist than they were. He approaches politics purely as a power struggle. Domination is what is at stake.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2011/jun/24/working-life-nuclear-reactor-operator","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-24T22:02:00Z","webTitle":"A working life: The nuclear reactor operator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jun/24/working-life-nuclear-reactor-operator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2011/jun/24/working-life-nuclear-reactor-operator","fields":{"headline":"A working life: The nuclear reactor operator","bodyText":"Malvern Jones is on a mission to unravel some of the common misconceptions and debunk some of the myths about nuclear power. For that, there's one man he holds culpable above all others. \"My friends all call me Homer Simpson,\" he jokes as we walk around the site of the Sizewell B nuclear plant. The giant ping-pong ball-like dome of the reactor – a distinctive, if controversial, landmark on the Suffolk coast – glints above us in the sunlight. Once through the numerous air-lock doors and multi-layered security into the reactor's control room, we confront a world apart (thankfully) from the fictional Springfield nuclear power plant, where safety inspector Simpson regularly falls asleep on the job and where the cracked reactor coolers are patched up with chewing gum. It is here – in a windowless hi-tech bunker with Dr Strangelove-style lighting (specially designed not to cast any shadows which might make it difficult to read the monitors or give false readings) – that Jones spends the lion's share of his working time. As reactor operator, he holds one of the most senior and most important roles on the site, responsible for the day-to-day safe operation of the facility and the associated turbine generating equipment. His primary roles are managing reactivity, and safely manoeuvring the plant into a transitional state for the so-called refuelling \"outages\", typically carried out every 18 months. But safety is an emotive word when it comes to nuclear power and even more so now, with fresh questions triggered by the Fukushima power plant disaster following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March, which led to radiation leaks from reactors and sparked worldwide concern. Despite this, Jones is adamant people's worries are rooted in a fear of the unknown. \"They see the images on TV, they've heard about the accidents at Chernobyl and, more recently, at Fukushima, and they ask, Could it happen here?\" His belief, unsurprisingly, is not. \"The devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is a human tragedy, but we are fortunate in this country not to have seismic activity on the same scale,\" he says. \"The energy from the UK's largest earthquake was 130,000 times smaller than the one which hit Japan.\" But he admits: \"Our plants will become even safer because we're determined to learn the lessons from Japan and build on our strong safety record.\" He insists he is comfortable working in a nuclear power station. \"Our job is to manage risk and no job, including mine, should be at risk.\" The reactor is the nerve-centre of Sizewell B, producing electricity which goes straight into the National Grid and then on to some 2.5m homes across the south-east. The UK's only pressurised water reactor, the 1,188 Megawatt electrical unit is also the newest of the UK's nuclear power facilities, having opened in 1995, and can supply just under 3% of the our entire electricity needs. Sizewell A, adjoining Sizewell B and one of the old-style, gas-cooled \"Magnox\" rectors, was closed in 2006. To the fury of local anti-nuclear campaigners, EDF Energy, the owner of Sizewell, wants to triple its capacity by opening a new plant with two new-style nuclear reactors – so-called Sizewell C – nearby. The government announced plans for the site this week and consultation with the local community should start early next year. As we continue our tour Jones – hailed as \"Mal\" by passing colleagues – explains how it all works. Sizewell B employs over 500 full-time staff, including 45 apprentices and 200 contractors, although many are at desk jobs in offices. There are some 140 staff in the operations department. 44 million gallons of North Sea water an hour, or 12,000 gallons per second, are pumped, after filtering, into the station from beyond concrete tidal defences, cooling the essential equipment. Fresh, clean water, heated by the reactor in a separate circuit boils in the steam generators, turning into steam which is then used to power twin turbines – housed in a vast, 30m high turbine hall – to create electricity. Overall, Jones claims, it is much cleaner than fossil fuel-fired power plants, which burn coal, petroleum or natural gas to heat the water, and a much \"greener\" energy source. The reactor contains control rods which include boron, a material which absorbs neutrons. So the rods can be \"dropped in\" quickly to shut the reactor down should conditions require it. Any event which results in a loss of coolant – be it water cooling the reactor, or the North Sea cooling essential plant and turbines – would require immediate plant shutdown. The quickest way would be to insert the rods (which can be done in a few seconds) so reactor power is immediately shut off. \"You hit the button and stop the power,\" Jones explains. \"It is known as a reactor trip.\" So for an outage he has to bring the plant right down, shut down the reactor, cool it and depressurise it – rather like a pressure cooker. Jones' own career has given him experience in most aspects of power station generation, including research, coal-fired power, gas-cooled reactors, prototype fast breeder reactors and pressurised water reactors. It takes around two years to fully train a reactor operator, assuming a good basic background in operations. Jones, brought up in Suffolk, was \"always interested in mechanics – taking things apart and putting them back together again. I used to help my dad maintain his car and I remember building a Sinclair radio.\" He joined the industry straight from school as a mechanical craft apprentice with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in what was then regarded as a job for life. Jones does not regret his decision not to go to university: \"In those days only a small proportion of the population was going to university and an apprenticeship was perfect.\" Even so, he achieved a higher national certificate in mechanical engineering before later, on day release, completing a degree in the subject from South Bank University. His career has seen him work at the now-closed Cliff Quay coal-fired power station in Suffolk, a spell at Sizewell A in the operations department and a stint as a lab technician at the CEGB's research facilities in Leatherhead, Surrey. Back in the control room we are faced with a battery of computer screens and panels with thousands of coloured switches, which are carefully monitored, 24/7, either by Jones and a colleague – who sit at imposing black leather chairs beside separate desks – or by another team on duty. They are watching for any sudden changes in reactor power, temperature or fluctuations in pressure, or signs of leaks. In an emergency they need to know exactly what to do quickly, although following a manual reactor shutdown the plant is designed for no operator intervention for half an hour. For quieter moments there is reference material on the main desk; a tome entitled Thermodynamic and Transport Properties of Fluids – or steam tables. Duty staff are allowed to read company newsletters and technical briefs but not material deemed to be \"non-relevant\". Nearby, under a Perspex cover, is arguably the most important button – the symbolic red knob which Jones can push to trigger an immediate shutdown of the reactor. Jones likens the operational side of nuclear power to aircraft: \"It is highly instrumentalised and in this room alone we have more than 25,000 alarms.\" Everywhere, he says, are back-up mechanisms to reduce the scope for things going wrong, including generators and fans, a coolant alternative to sea water if necessary. The biggest buzz, though, comes from starting up the reactor: \"You are in total control. You start off without enough heat to boil a kettle, and then you have enough power to launch a space shuttle. That is quite amazing.\" Although the energy sector has shrunk, \"the dash for gas\" has made a big dent in the environment and Jones believes nuclear power in the UK has a bright future, that he hopes will bring a wealth of job opportunities for a new generation of scientists and engineers. In the meantime, events in Japan mean the debate around whether the hazard of climate change is greater than that posed by nuclear disasters and waste is raging as intensely as ever. Jones is emphatic that his job is a \"green\" one: \"EDF Energy is the largest low carbon generator of electricity in the UK, thanks to stations like Sizewell B,\" he argues. \"Even when you take into account the construction of the station, the mining and transport of the uranium for the fuel, and the day-to-day operations, nuclear produces about the same amount of CO2 emissions as wind power, which is about one-hundredth of the emissions from traditional coal stations.\" And as well as his main, and very important job, Jones has been training the next generation of reactor operators at Sizewell B, spending several years working with computer programmers to develop the simulator model, which is identical to the real control room.

The MPs criticised attempts to hide the subsidies as \"deeply irresponsible\" and said they put the government's green credentials in jeopardy. The call comes at a critical time for the government , which is hoping to burnish its \"greenest government ever\" claim by accepting a proposal from the chief climate change adviser to adopt a tough emissions-cutting target for 2027, which would put the UK ahead of any other country in reducing carbon. The deal is expected to be announced this week. However, recommendations such as stricter carbon cuts before 2023 and controls on emissions from aviation and shipping have been ignored, as ministers are not legally obliged to consider them yet. The deal was hammered out over the weekend after weeks of squabbling over the targets among cabinet ministers, which pitted the business secretary Vince Cable against fellow Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, the climate secretary. The new target puts the government in line to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels. But the row over reactor subsidies points to divisions in the coalition on nuclear energy. \"Ministers believe that new nuclear could play a key role in keeping the lights on and meeting our climate change targets, but they don't want to own up to supporting it,\" said Tim Yeo, Tory chairman of the energy and climate change committee, which produced the report. \"This is understandable given the promise they made not to subsidise nuclear, but it would be deeply irresponsible to skew the whole process of electricity market reform simply to save face.\" Nuclear power is a potential flashpoint for the coalition, because the Liberal Democrats oppose new reactors but the Conservatives want to encourage them. The coalition compromised on allowing new reactors but without public subsidies. According to the report, hidden subsidies will be awarded through government-supported long-term contracts to supply energy, and a minimum price for carbon emissions. That floor price for carbon, levied on businesses, could channel more than £1bn to nuclear generators over the next decade, according to estimates by environmental groups. Nuclear companies are also likely to receive government assurances that the taxpayer could foot any increases to the estimated bill for storing radioactive waste from new reactors. \"The government must be upfront about the support it is giving to nuclear and not hide subsidies,\" said Yeo. Simon Bullock, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"This report shows the government's plans are stacked in favour of nuclear power over renewables and so vague they risk locking the UK into a new generation of polluting fossil fuels. We don't need to gamble on new nuclear power - by boosting green energy alternatives and slashing energy waste we can tackle climate change and create new jobs.\" Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, which represents manufacturers, said the tougher targets on climate change would harm UK industry: \"The UK is already committed to some of the toughest carbon targets. Committing to ploughing a lone furrow without international agreement will damage our economy for little or no environmental benefit. There is little if any appetite across the EU for any further move towards a higher target when there is so much economic uncertainty and government must continue to seek international consensus.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-19T13:02:07Z","webTitle":"Ukraine raises $785m to seal Chernobyl under new 'shell'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine raises $785m to seal Chernobyl under new 'shell'","bodyText":"The ruined nuclear reactor at Chernobyl is to be sealed within a 20,000-tonne steel shield designed to prevent any further radiation from escaping for 100 years. It would be large enough to enclose St Paul's Cathedral in London, or the Statue of Liberty. Governments from around the world have pledged $785m (£480m) at a conference in Kiev, a week before the 25th anniversary of the nuclear accident in Ukraine – on 26 April 1986 the reactor suffered explosions and caught fire. This brings the total raised for the Chernobyl safety works to $1.8bn. Twenty-eight governments have so far offered money. The European commission was the biggest contributor with $143m at the Kiev Nuclear Safety Summit. The US pledged $123m and Britain, which still has more than 300 hill farms in Wales under radiation restrictions following the fallout from Chernobyl, will contribute $50m. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced an extra $172m. Japan, Italy and Canada are considering whether to contribute. The planned arch-shaped structure will be 190 metres (623ft) wide and more than 100 metres tall, taking five years to build. It will replace the concrete sarcophagus erected around the reactor in the months following the accident. This shield now has cracks, raising fears that 95% of the original nuclear material remaining inside the reactor could escape. Radiation levels directly over the sarcophagus are too high for the arch to be built over it, so the structure will be constructed in two pieces, then moved over the site on rails. It is designed so that the authorities could start dismantling the reactor from inside in 100 years. The shield is intended to stay in place until either the radiation threat decreases or the Ukrainian government finds a permanent storage facility for the 200 tonnes of uranium and 1 tonne of plutonium within the ruins. World governments, which had already raised more than $1.6bn in international funding for the shelter, as well as for a permanent nuclear fuel store for other reactors on the Chernobyl site, said that the current crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan had persuaded them to respond to the appeal by Ukraine, which estimates that Chernobyl has cost the nation more than $12bn. \"Recent events in Fukushima have reminded us of the danger this issue may represent,\" said the European commission president, José Manuel Barroso. The French prime minister, François Fillon, said Fukushima evoked memories of Chernobyl: \"More than ever, our responsibility is to join together our efforts to limit the consequences of such disasters and to prepare for the future.\" Mikhail Gorbachev, president of the Soviet Union at the time of the Chernobyl disaster and now head of the environment group Green Cross International, used the occasion of the 25th anniversary to say nuclear power was not the answer to the world's energy problems or to climate change. In a statement he said: \"Nuclear power has been presented as a financially sound, economically efficient, clean and safe solution that will bring about energy security and drive economic growth. Recently, the so-called 'nuclear renaissance' has hitched a free ride on the back of the need to find low-carbon solutions to the climate crisis. \"The bottom line on the economics of nuclear power is that it simply does not add up. That is why private investment is wisely focusing on better alternatives. \"It is necessary to realise that nuclear power is not a panacea, as some observers allege, for energy sufficiency or climate change. Its cost effectiveness is also exaggerated, as its real cost does not account for hidden expenses. \"In the United States, for example, direct subsidies to nuclear energy amounted to $115bn between 1947 and 1999, with an additional $145bn in indirect subsidies. In contrast, subsidies to wind and solar energy, combined over this same period, totalled only $5.5bn.\" But Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said: \"Today, nuclear power is the only real alternative to fossil fuel as a source of a reliable supply.\" He acknowledged that confidence in atomic energy had taken a severe blow after the tsunami-triggered disaster at Fukushima. \"Fukushima represents a potentially significant setback for nuclear power,\" he told participants at the forum, although he stressed that confidence would be \"re-established in due course\", then added: \"Chernobyl and Fukushima should be shown to be aberrations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2012/mar/18/hilda-murrell-michael-mansfield","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-18T00:06:28Z","webTitle":"Hilda Murrell murder: call to examine 'MI5 link' to murder of nuclear activist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/18/hilda-murrell-michael-mansfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2012/mar/18/hilda-murrell-michael-mansfield","fields":{"headline":"Hilda Murrell murder: call to examine 'MI5 link' to murder of nuclear activist","bodyText":"One of Britain's leading human rights lawyers has demanded a fresh police inquiry to establish what the British intelligence services knew about the murder of a prominent anti-nuclear campaigner. Michael Mansfield QC said new evidence meant that an independent police force should be appointed to examine enduring concerns and inconsistencies relating to the death of Hilda Murrell in March 1984. Murrell, 78, was abducted from her home in Shrewsbury and her body was discovered days later in a nearby copse. A high-profile campaigner against nuclear weapons, she had been due to present evidence to the public inquiry into the proposed Sizewell B nuclear reactor in East Anglia. Her death triggered numerous conspiracy theories and allegations relating to the involvement of MI5, with one MP, Tam Dalyell, telling parliament that \"men of British intelligence\" were involved. Subsequent claims from intelligence sources that they never even opened a file on the rose-growing anti-nuclear campaigner have now been dismissed by Mansfield as \"completely ludicrous\". He said: \"There must have been a file for a number of reasons. One of them being that she plainly was very active and very outspoken about a government policy that was extremely sensitive at that time – nuclear power. \"It was central to Margaret Thatcher's thinking. They would have been watching closely what she was up to, who she was associating with and so on. \"The victim was consumed with anxiety that something was going to happen to her. A look at why that might be involves the evidence she was about to give to the Sizewell inquiry.\" The involvement of Mansfield, whose past cases include the Stephen Lawrence murder, follows the painstaking accumulation of evidence on the case by Murrell's nephew, Commander Robert Green. The former naval intelligence officer was one of a handful of people privy to details of the sinking of the Argentinian ship the General Belgrano, during the 1982 Falklands conflict. Green became embroiled in allegations that he leaked intelligence to Dalyell that the Belgrano had been attacked while steaming away from the Falklands, a revelation that undermined Britain's justification for the sinking. Just two days before Murrell was abducted, Dalyell began asking ministers detailed questions about the movements of the Belgrano when it was sunk. Murrell's links to Green and her outspoken nature may have placed her in the spotlight of the intelligence agencies. \"They [the security services] must have noticed his connection with her. Therefore they might have thought that she possessed information of a sensitive nature,\" said Mansfield. Despite 28 years having passed since her death, Green will this week reveal details of what he claims are attempts to intimidate him in order to prevent him from investigating the case. Despite having moved to New Zealand, Green says he is the subject of continuing surveillance and that the tyres of his car have been slashed, his mail intercepted and, occasionally, his house broken into. He has continued to investigate, arriving in London this week to share fresh evidence collated for his book on the murder, A Thorn In Their Side. Among questions raised about the case are those casting fresh doubts on the conviction of a burglar, Andrew George, who was jailed for life in 2005 for Murrell's murder. George was aged 16 at the time and in care at a children's home near her home. The prosecution believed that he panicked during a burglary before abducting Murrell. George's DNA was found to match samples taken from the scene, yet a previously undisclosed witness statement made by a forensic scientist in the case, Michael Appleby, indicates that he found DNA under Murrell's fingernails from another man. Green claims that this information was withheld from the trial jury. Another troubling aspect of the case relates to the testimony of the owner of the copse where the body was discovered. On the day after the murder, Captain Ian Scott visited the copse to check for trees that needed felling. Despite visiting the exact spot where her body was found, Scott somehow missed it. Yet photographs clearly show the body being visible from a distance. Subsequent police inquiries suggested that he was looking up at trees and would not have been studying the ground. \"There was no way that somebody of his calibre, of his knowledge, would have overlooked Hilda's body,\" said Mansfield. \"Together, these factors require a reinvestigation in relation to material that never really surfaced in any of the judicial proceedings, either the inquest or the trial itself.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2011/jul/20/live-webchat-mark-lynas","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-20T12:54:00Z","webTitle":"Live webchat: Mark Lynas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jul/20/live-webchat-mark-lynas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2011/jul/20/live-webchat-mark-lynas","fields":{"headline":"Live webchat: Mark Lynas","bodyText":"After last week's illuminating chat with Sarah Waters, this week's guest is one of the most compelling contemporary writers of non-fiction. Mark Lynas's books include High Tide, which was shortlisted for the Guardian first book award in 2004, and Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (2007) which won the Royal Society prize for best science book in 2008. His most recent book, The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans, is just out and reviewed this week. In 2009 he was appointed advisor on climate change to the President of the Maldives, which aims to be the first carbon neutral country on Earth by 2020. Mark will be online to chat on Friday 22 July between 1pm and 2pm. Feel free to start posting your questions now, so he can have a full hour to answer, and log back in on Friday to join in the conversation. Bluecloud asks: Hi Mark, As a fellow environmentalist I look forward to this debate. My question: Why is your book not available as a free/affordable download? Surely your occupation as an author should be subservient to that of your role as an environmentalist. Mark Lynas replies: @Bluecloud - try working for four years for no pay and you'll see the answer to your question! wjk7 asks: Does Mr Lynas believe ,as many many of us do, that the urgent implementation of a sane, workable and humane population policy will help the earth survive the age of humans ? My admittedly pessimistic view is that we are running out of time and are busy fiddling while the burning goes on-to use a well-worn metaphor. Mark Lynas replies: @wjk7 - No, I don't believe it will make much difference. The population of 2050 is already hard-wired, because most people alive then have already been born now, or will be over the next decade or two to today's young people. There is not much you can do to influence this, so we have to figure out how to feed 9.2 bn within resource constraints. GRLCowan asks: Do you think taxes on the carbon content of fossil fuels are helpful in promoting fossil fuel conservation and substitution, or harmful in that they increase governments' incentive to delay or sabotage this? Mark Lynas replies: @GRLCowan - I think a price on carbon is generally helpful, though it cannot do the job on its own. Iamtheurbanspaceman asks: What science qualifications do you have - and how can you justify your employment as a climate change advisor to a government? Exactly what does that involve? Mark Lynas replies: @Iamtheurbanspaceman - My science qualifications = zero. My job as advisor to the President of the Maldives is less about the science and more about the policy these days to be honest. You could more make the criticism that as a non-scientist by training I shouldn't write science books, but in actual fact perhaps my lack of specialism is helpful to try to have a bigger picture view. You decide though. JJRichardson asks: Do you see any place for GM foods in world where food will be harder to produce? Mark Lynas replies: @JJRichardson - why will food be \"harder to produce\"? Actually it is easier to produce than ever now because technology (and experience) allows very high productivity for the same inputs of land and light. And yes, genetic engineering is one of a number of useful technologies in that regard. Hoggle asks: How realistic would you say the following is as a 'worse case scenario' 1) the tipping points in Six Degrees are exceeded leading to a 5-10 degree world temperature rise over the next 100 or so years. 2) ecosystems in every part of the world collapse, turning most of the land and oceans to deserts (in the biodiversity sense). 3) food production on any meaningful scale disappears 4) the human race ceases to exist, save for a few pockets in self-contained biospheres, slowly dying as a result of continued inability to either mimic or respect the complexity of nature and power of evolutionary forces. Mark Lynas replies: @Hoggle - Highly unrealistic, even as a worst-case scenario. Thankfully. fr33cycler asks: You have been forthright in blaming environmentalists for blocking nuclear power and setting back progress to a low carbon future. Why do you think environmentalists have been (relatively) successful in stopping nuclear power stations, but have failed to stop road building, out-of-town shopping, airport expansion and many other developments that don't help us go low carbon? Could it not be that the economic case for power stations is weak by comparison to these other developments, and that it was really electricity provatisation that stopped them being built in the UK, not environmentalists? And how does that affect your argument that nuclear is a cost effective solution? Mark Lynas replies: @fr33cycler - Don't agree. Actually the campaigns against airport expansion have been very successful too. That's why no new runway for Heathrow is now gvt policy. Also, why we now have a Climate Change Act, thanks to Friends of the Earth et al, very successful campaigning. Green movement in Europe also stopped GM in its tracks, though this is a negative result in my view. I'm not saying greens are all-powerful by any means, but they have undoubtedly been a significantly powerful constituency, and have nearly regulated nuclear power out of existence by insisting on far more expensive safety standards than is necessary and exists for any comparably risky operation. ambodach asks: What would you say to the many individuals criticising GM crops on this thread currently live on Guardian Environment ? \"The cost of spurning GM crops is too high\" by JDG Jones http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/21/gm-debate?commentpage=last Mark Lynas replies: @ambodach - I entirely agree with Professor Jones. Bluecloud asks: Thanks for your reply Mark. A lot of what I do is pro bono if it is for environmental organisations. But I agree we have little alternative other than making money in order to survive and some of that work is damaging to the planet. That's where we have to make choices. That's my point. I do not expect you to live without an income, but the way to do this affects the outcome and in a world where information technology has enabled the online book, why did you not choose this route instead of the printing press? I for one would buy your book as a download. Mark Lynas replies: @Bluecloud - I'm not sure what your point is. The only writers I know who have done free download books are those who what alternative income, which I don't. David McKay, for instance, who was at that point (Without Hot Air) a full-time academic. The God Species is on Kindle, if that helps. Are you against printed books per se, or something? ColinG asks: Is the anti-nuclear movement supported by fossil fuel interests? Mark Lynas replies: @ColinG - I do not think the anti-nuclear movement is supported by fossil fuel interests, no. Have you any evidence that this is the case? UnpublishedWriter asks: How will the Maldives achieve carbon neutrality when Tourism accounts for 28% of GDP, more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts and when over 90% of government tax revenue is raised from import duties and tourism-related taxes? Presumably the majority of tourists and imports are flown in? Mark Lynas replies: @UnpublishedWriter - regarding how the Maldives can become carbon neutral whilst depending on long-haul tourism... absolutely there is a difficult issue there. Our carbon baseline survey suggested if you quantify the entire aviation emissions of tourists incoming then it equals the rest of the country's emissions from electricity etc put together. No option for the moment but to move towards large-scale inbuilt offsetting, as they are not about to ask tourists not to fly. gubulgaria asks: Hello Mark, One of George Monbiot's favourite arguments in support of nuclear power is that people won't accept large scale renewables, particularly on-shore wind farms, in their local area, and therefore nuclear is needed to fill the gap. Given the recent Ipsos MORI international opinion poll on energy - http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jun/23/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste?INTCMP=SRCH - which found that nuclear was the least popular energy source (62% opposed) and wind was one of the most popular (7% opposed), does this expose Monbiot's argument as hopelessly parochial, and does your support for nuclear power rely on the same asssumption that British middle class rural nimbys are representative of the world's population? Thanks. Mark Lynas replies: @gubulgaria - The first rule of George Monbiot is that I don't talk about George Monbiot. Could you please phrase your question differently? Brookerfan asks: Mark - what are your views on Mr Lomborg ? What areas do you agree on and disagree on ? Mark Lynas replies: @brookerfan - I don't talk about Mr Lomborg either! Bluecloud asks: Thanks for you blog post on nuclear waste Mark. I will read it properly later. Of course the prinicple R is in fact Reduce followed by Reuse and then Recycle in that order. My concern about nuclear waste lies with the mid-level waste, which forms the bulk and cannot be recycled into nuclear fuel. I am also concerned about the political issues arising from collusion with industry in the UK. How to disentangle the corrupt influence of the nuclear industry from the government is a major puzzle I see no easy solution to. Mark Lynas replies: @Bluecloud - regarding industry and government links... of course democratic systems need to be very clear about transparency and avoiding corrupt conflicts of interest. But having said that, the gvt is most interested in keeping the lights on - presiding over blackouts would mean losing the next election for sure. And energy does need to be centrally planned to a certain extent - just leaving it to the market like tins of beans can't deliver decarbonisation or energy security in a reliable sense. fr33cycler asks: Come off it Mark...the campaign to stop a third runway at Heathrow succeeded because because of local noise considerations in marginal Tory seats, not because of climate change. I know everyone defines \"environmentalists\" differently, but this was not an environmental victory in the sense that the runway was stopped for the major reason that it had a bad impact on climate change. Environmentalists in that regard have had next to no impact on flight numbers, the Government still wants those to increase, but now from regional airports. Greens have thus lost anti expansion campaigns at Manchester, Heathrow T5, Gatwick, Stansted etc etc etc. I hadn't fully grasped that you felt safety standards at nuclear power stations were too high. I understand the rationale...but do you think a Government decision to reduce safety standards is going to be any easier to win than a plan to build more renewables? Mark Lynas replies: @fr33cycler - no, I agree, it would be political suicide for any government to be seen to reduce nuclear safety standards. But that doesn't mean they are based on any reasonable or rational risk assessment. Radiation exposures are far higher in hospitals (medicine gives us all much higher doses of artificial radiation than nuclear power) but no-one minds that much because it's obviously beneficial! As to renewables, don't forget I entirely support a 'both' rather than an 'either-or' approach. Having travelled through mid-Wales recently though and seen the constant parade of anti-wind banners and placards lining the road for mile after mile, I don't hold out much hope for multi-GW deployment of onshore wind in the British Isles. Though anti-nuke campaigning may rule out that option too... in which case we'll end up with more fossil fuels. Bluecloud asks Mark, What do you make of the Global Warming Policy Foundation? Would you not say that they are motivated by something more nefarious than \"ideological wishful thinking\"? Mark Lynas replies: @Bluecloud - Not really. It is fairly clear what GWPF stands for - it is far more concerned to oppose climate policy than climate science. Not all its advisors are beyond the pale either, Gwyn Prins for example. I subscribe to the Newsletter GWPF produces - although I don't agree with hardly any of it, it is important to stay exposed to outside arguments and perspectives! Mark Lynas: Thanks @Bluecloud and to everyone else who asked questions. Apologies to those who got missed out. The debate can continue on the comments here (which I will check back in with) and over on my blog.

Speaking to reporters on a trip to Mexico, Clegg said that the new uncertainty for the nuclear industry could raise its liabilities and in all likelihood entail some kind of public subsidy – which the coalition would be unable to provide. When the Liberal Democrats joined the coalition the party was seen to drop its long-held opposition to nuclear power but retain a commitment of no new subsidies for the industry. Any pushback over the perceived viability of nuclear energy would cause ructions in the coalition; some Tory MPs are convinced that Britain's energy mix must include nuclear power, to try to meet all the UK's energy needs while keeping a commitment to carbon emissions reductions. Some members of the Conservative benches think renewable energy sources would fail to make the weight if nuclear power were knocked out of the equation. bLib Dems believe the huge subsidies the industry can receive skew the market in favour of nuclear. Speaking in Mexico, Clegg said: \"We have always said there are two conditions for the future of nuclear power – it has to be safe and cannot let the taxpayer be ripped off. We could be in a situation now where the potential liabilities are higher, which makes it more unlikely to find private investment. There will be no rowing back on the coalition agreement, the agreement was very clear.\" Clegg said the new carbon price brought in by the coalition, which will reward low-carbon technologies like nuclear and renewables, could help ameliorate the cost pressures on the nuclear industry. But he said that he was still unsure whether the industry would remain viable. Eight further nuclear plants are due for construction in the UK. The chief nuclear officer, Mike Weightman, is managing a review of the safety of British reactors in the aftermath of the events in Japan. The interim findings are due in May. At the moment, UK policy is based on a three-pronged portfolio approach: nuclear energy but also more renewable energy and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities. Despite there being few immediate parallels with Japan's reactors – which were built in an earthquake and tsunami zone – the problem for the UK government will arise if the nuclear industry as a whole becomes more insecure and therefore more expensive for investors, requiring subsidies. The issue of nuclear power has the potential of becoming a \"wedge issue\" over the next few years as Lib Dems seek to distinguish themselves from their pro-nuclear coalition partners ahead of the next general election. In Germany, the head of the ruling Christian Democratic Union party blamed the near-meltdown of the Fukushima reactors in Japan for a popular revolt against new nuclear power in Germany, which was registered at the ballot box this weekend with Angela Merkel's party partly losing to the anti-nuclear Greens in Baden-Württemburg. In Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne and Munich 200,000 protesters took to the streets demanding the closure of all 17 of Germany's nuclear reactors. Merkel has already had to act. She declared a three-month moratorium on a decision about whether to extend the life of the existing reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/feb/22/coach-trip-m25","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-22T12:19:28Z","webTitle":"Why would someone pay for a coach trip around the M25? | Owen Hatherley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/22/coach-trip-m25","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/22/coach-trip-m25","fields":{"headline":"Why would someone pay for a coach trip around the M25?","bodyText":"Why would someone pay to spend several hours on a coach on the M25? To admire the design of concrete bridges? To find collective solace in the loneliness of motorway service stations? As a new form of trainspotting? Or maybe because it's now, well, fashionable? It has been building for years. Books in which philosophers ponder airport concourses. Meditations on British roads. Psychogeographers trudging round the orbital network. Television documentaries on the history of the motorway. Glossy service station scrapbooks. The news that a coach tour operator has sold out a complete tour of the famously entropic ring around London just shows how mainstream all this has become. A possible ur-text for the contemporary obsession with modern mundanity is photographer Martin Parr's book Boring Postcards, published in the late 1990s. The point with the boring postcards is that they were not, in the context of the turn of the 21st century, boring. Rather they were bizarre, dreamlike, improbable images of things that we once must have treasured, that somehow became jokes and non-sequiturs. Parr's collection amassed practically every component of the Newly Interesting Boring. 1960s concrete infrastructure, such as the sublime sweep of Preston bus station; public art on postwar marketplaces in Stockport; nuclear power stations; airport departure lounges; suburban developments, holiday camps, modernist housing estates; and, of course, the motorway, from its futurist service stations to the long strips of clear concrete ploughed between green verges. For the past few years, the internet has abounded with material like this. Print publications range from David Lawrence's startlingly rich and comprehensive Food on the Move, a history of the motorway service station, to Anne Ward's travel guide to improbable Scottish holiday destinations Nothing to See Here. What Parr did was a simple act of defamiliarisation. If these were just contemporary photographs, we would be nearer to the linked, but in many ways dissimilar Crap Towns or Is Britain Great? books with their imagery of miserable Blighty. These, though, were postcards – sent off by travellers, holidaymakers or the inhabitants of new estates with what must have been some pride, some sense that these \"boring\" places had real value, that they were worth looking at. During the Blair boom, with its bright, restless, neoliberal effacement of the clunky, provincial modernism of postwar social democracy, this started to mean something quite different. The implication was that once, these mundane things were considered rather special, by their designers, owners and users. Maybe they could be again? Parr may not have intended the postcards to mean anything of the sort, and it could just have been an elaborate joke on his part. Others, though, were deadly serious about this archaeology of the mundane. It's perhaps a way of reasserting something lost. In modern art and design from the 1910s to the 1930s, transport, production and urbanism were celebrated as a new technologised world; when Kraftwerk evoked the same in the 1970s, the assumption was that they were joking too. Instead, it's likely they were trying to recover a lost innocence – a simple joy at the capabilities of man and machine. The approach they took to this also borrowed from the interwar avant-garde. As Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky put it, \"the purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known\". The technique of art is to make objects \"unfamiliar\", to create a \"deautomatised perception\" in which you suddenly see something you see every day in a completely new and revelatory way. This can be a very enjoyable game, and most of the books and projects mentioned above show generous, funny and warm ways of looking at what is all too easily dismissed as drab and nondescript. You could even create a radicalised definition of it, to encompass the seemingly \"boring\" work on containerisation and ports by photographer Allan Sekula, where seeing is radicalised by revealing the facts of production, distribution and exploitation behind the mundane everyday artefact. Yet it could just as easily be a wan, dilettantish and apolitical way of looking at the world of things – staring at the sheer misery of a traffic jam and whispering \"the world is beautiful\". • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/11/nuclear-industry-review-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-11T15:23:00Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear safety review finds 38 cases for improvement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/11/nuclear-industry-review-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/11/nuclear-industry-review-uk","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear safety review finds 38 cases for improvement","bodyText":"A review of nuclear safety in the UK has found 38 areas where safety could be improved, in lessons drawn from the Fukushima incident in Japan early this year. The review, ordered by the government following the Japanese experience, pinpointed critical areas for concern, including risks associated with flooding, the layout of plants, and the state of preparedness for emergencies. Ministers and the relevant regulators will be asked to look at these as a matter of urgency. However, the review published on Tuesday also concluded that the UK's nuclear industry is broadly safe, with \"no fundamental safety weaknesses\". If the areas of concern raised in the light of the Fukushima are addressed, the industry will be \"even safer\", the report said. The relatively clean bill of health was rapidly seized on by the government. Mike Weightman, the chief inspector of nuclear installations and executive head of the Office for Nuclear Regulation, who carried out the review, said: \"I remain confident that our UK nuclear facilities have no fundamental safety weaknesses. [We] already require protection of nuclear sites against the worst-case scenarios that are predictable for the UK. But we are not complacent. Our philosophy is one of continuous improvement. No matter how high our standards, the quest for improvement must never stop. We will ensure lessons are learned from Fukushima. Action has already been taken in many cases, with work underway to further enhance safety at UK sites.\" Chris Huhne, the climate and energy secretary, said: \"The report makes clear that the UK has one of the best nuclear safety regimes in the world, and that nuclear power can go on powering homes and businesses across the UK, as well as supporting jobs. We must however continue to improve where we can, not just with operating power stations and new sites, but by dealing with our nuclear legacy in a robust and effective manner too.\" Huhne stopped short of calling for a new generation of nuclear plants, as the Liberal Democrats party, to which he belongs, does not support nuclear newbuild – unlike its Conservative coalition partners. The government said it would give the Office for Nuclear Regulation statutory powers to improve safety. Among the lessons highlighted in the report were the need to prioritise safety reviews and to review plants' reliance on off-site infrastructure such as the electrical grid, in case of serious disruptions such as natural disasters. When power grids were shut down by the Japanese tsunami, there were problems in powering the water pumps needed to cool the stricken reactors. Floods or earthquakes could cause radioactivity to leak into the environment from Britain's nuclear bomb factories, Weightman's review also revealed. In a submission to the review, the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) said that some of the sensitive operations carried out at Aldermaston and Burghfield in Berkshire were \"vulnerable\" to flooding or seismic damage. Burghfield was badly flooded after heavy rain in July 2007, which an internal AWE report said caused severe disruption and \"extensive damage\" to an explosives area. But the report stressed that there was no \"threat to the nuclear safety of either the AWE sites, the public or the environment.\" Now, however, in a 40-page submission to the Weightman review by the Office for Nuclear Regulation, AWE accepts that radioactivity could escape. \"Some containment may be vulnerable to flooding in which case some limited spread of radiological contamination could occur,\" it said. This would be \"a minor consequence event\", AWE added. \"Some containment (process and structures) may be vulnerable to damage from a seismic event. There could be particulate release as a result of loss of containment or fire.\" The AWE submission also disclosed that it was dependent on electricity from the National Grid in the event of emergencies. As a result of a review, \"the on-site electricity distribution system is to be enhanced over the coming year\", AWE said. \"This enhancement unill remove any nuclear safety dependency on the national grid.\" Responding to the review, the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) issued a statement in favour of pursuing nuclear energy, but warned that it must be balanced against risks. \"Like all forms of power generation nuclear power is not without risk. The seriousness and potential global nature of accidents in the nuclear industry bring particular challenges,\" the RAE said. \"Continued vigilance, transparency and co-operation by all countries and organisations must be maintained on issues of safety and security. The potential scale of a disaster means that, despite the fact that accidents are rare, traditional probabilistic methods of assessing the risk should be supplemented with contingency plans to deal with all conceivable eventualities.\" Weightman and his team visited Japan in June, and saw the Fukushima plant and the actions that had been taken to make it safe. They were given access to detailed information about the plant's workings, and met and talked to the workers involved in the clean-up. Weightman also took account of evidence from the International Atomic Energy Agency and energy companies. The Fukushima plant was the source of a serious radiation leak, which took weeks to bring under control and is still the subject of an ongoing clean-up and monitoring operation. Weightman said: \"While it is only six months since the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, I am satisfied we are in a position to have drawn reliable conclusions and identified the main lessons to improve safety. Detailed technical information will no doubt continue to emerge and the Office for Nuclear Regulation will continue to monitor it and take action as necessary.\" Sue Ion, fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: \"This report also emphasises the issues associated with the long-term management of the UK's historic legacy sites where there are significant engineering challenges and where 'utmost vigour and determination' should be taken to ensure their clean up and decommissioning.\" But independent nuclear analyst John Large said the review was a \"whitewash\". \"I see the hidden hand of the industry being very influential. There is nothing here to counter the gung-ho contention that everything is fine. Everyone acknowledges the severe failures in the way that the Japanese reported Fukushima. If the UK regulators have depended on the Japanese they have not taken good advice.\" Large questioned why aircraft crashes had not been considered and said that security issues had been glossed over. \"Fukushima was a gift to terrorists. They now know how vulnerable these reactors are. The real gap [in the report] is that UK reactors would not survive more than an hour without power. They have not released the reports done under stress testing. I fear the regulators has just fallen into line with government. This is a 'let's not rock-the-boat response'.\" Paul Dorfman, a senior researcher at the University of Warwick, and a member of the Nuclear Consultation Group, said the review was partial and flawed. \"It has not looked at the size of emergency planning zones around UK reactors [about 3km] compared with the 30km evacuation area in Japan; it leaves open key questions about flooding and security risks. Accidents are by nature, accidental. The cost of occluding this commonsense axiom can prove radiologically catastrophic.\" Green politicians and groups were also critical of the review. Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \"This will do little to reassure the public that the nuclear industry can be trusted to power our energy future. The status of our nuclear facilities is a crucial national security issue, yet the government has concluded that nothing needs to change in the light of the Japanese disaster – the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl – even before it has submitted the UK's assessment of our facilities to the EU's 'stress test' process, due in November.\" Louise Hutchins, energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"This looks like a rushed report, before the full implications are known about Fukushima. It's designed with one objective - to give the green light to a new generation of nuclear power stations, irrespective of the safety, environmental or rising financial costs of those nuclear stations. This is government complacency.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/23/2011-environmental-year-review","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-23T12:31:09Z","webTitle":"2011: Britain's environmental year in review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/23/2011-environmental-year-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/23/2011-environmental-year-review","fields":{"headline":"2011: Britain's environmental year in review","bodyText":"2011 was a torrid year for what remains of natural Britain. There was a cold winter, a glorious but very dry spring, an Autumnal heatwave and a late drought, but the government which promised to be the greenest ever, was pilloried for its proposed actions on planning, forests, air quality, climate change, solar energy, sustainable development, biodiversity, nuclear power, badgers, geo-engineering, rivers, shale gas, energy conservation, roads, public transport and a lot more besides. Only a few nuclear industry fans and some optimistic marine conservationists had much to celebrate. It started terribly for the politicians. By mid-January protesters in the Forest of Dean and the Lake District had made it clear that plans to sell off 250,000ha of the English forestry estate were barmy. In the next few weeks, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to stop it, and environment secretary Caroline Spelman unified left and right, crusty and county, young and old, the National Trust and the Countryside Alliance against her plan. Remarkably, the only people standing up for it appeared to be some of the big wildlife conservation groups who, close to government, possibly stood to benefit, along with rich landowners. Cameron had to step in and Spelman was forced to withdraw the plans and apologise profusely in the Commons for \"having got it wrong\". A panel of the great and the good was set up to reconsider the future of English forests and and will report back in the spring of 2012. But an even more embarrassing confrontation with the public came in July with government's draft plans to dismantle the entire planning system. Nobody objected to rationalisation, but the proposed presumption in favour of development over all social and environmental considerations led to apoplexy among organisations as disparate as Friends of the Earth and the CPRE, Campaign for Better Transport, local authorities and the Theatres Trust. Most feared a return to sprawl, the demise of favourite places, and damaging free for all development in suitable places. The National Trust, its gander up after leading the fight against the forest sell-off, went head to head with the government, and got 200,000 signatures to try to force a climbdown. But while opposition simmered through the year as a long consultation took place, the tipping point may have been reached in December when a powerful committee of MPs demanded that the \"default yes\" to development be removed from the text. The planning minister, Grant Shapps must decide soon. However, the government did please that half of the population which felt that the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan should not delay the building of 10 reactors in Britain. The UK's chief inspector of nuclear installations, Mike Weightman, reported in May that the Japanese disaster was no reason to abandon nuclear power, but it later emerged that extra safety checks mean the first station cannot now be delivered before 2019, and could cost vastly more than expected. Meanwhile, ministers revealed that the government wanted to build a plant for processing nuclear waste, just four months after a similar plant costing the taxpayer £1.4bn was closed. A combination of the recession and a mild winter had seen UK carbon emissions fall in 2009, but in March 2011 the latest figures showed them up by nearly 3%. The better news, said Decc, was that the UK had now cut greenhouse gas emissions by 24.8% since 1990 and now generates nearly 25% of its electricity from low carbon, nuclear and renewable sources. Undeterred by its unpopularity in the countryside, the government gave in to pressure by farmers to slaughter over eight years, as many as 105,000 badgers, which, it is alleged, cost the nation as much as £100m a year by spreading TB. The cull, to be carried out in Wales and the west country, will be carried out by farmers with rifles and is likely to be strongly opposed by animal lovers. Hopes that shale gas, locked in rocks deep below Lancashire and elsewhere, could compensate for dwindling north sea oil and gas reserves were raised in September when Australian fracking company Cuadrilla announced that it had \"gas in-place\" in its licence area in Lancashire of 200 trillion cubic feet – more than the entire previous UK proven gas reserves, and many times what the British Geological Survey had estimated. But reality struck when scientists concluded that the test drilling earlier in the year had \"highly probably\" set off two mild earthquakes and protesters invaded the company rigs. Deutsche Bank calmed nerves when its analysis suggested it was extremely unlikely that there would be a bonanza or that it would reduce gas prices. Finally, conservation had a bad year. Powerful groups like the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, the Woodland trust, Plantlife, Buglife and Butterfly Conservation could all point to individual successes, but Natural England, the official body responsible for advising and defending the natural world at the highest levels of government, effectively lost its voice. Its budget was cut to the bone, many of its best people left, and in the words of ecologist Peter Marren, author of Nature Conservation, \"our wildlife watchdog has morphed into a pathetic delivery boy, charged with attending to \"customer focus\". The longterm consequences on wildlife may not be seen for years, but the government gave notice of what it is planning, asking the public through its \"red tape challenge\" to identify regulations and laws that could be lifted to allow business to perform better. Under the environment topic, the 159 regulations on biodiversity, wildlife management, landscape, countryside and recreation are specifically mentioned, as well as the regulations on air quality, energy labelling and sustainable products. The potential for rolling back 60 years of environmental protection is now greater than ever. The possibility of deep embarrassment for Britain at the London Olympics as well as swingeing EU fines helped to shoot air pollution way up the national agenda in 2011. Government figures released in June showed that 17 regions and cities, including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cardiff, were well above the legal limit for N02 emission, and were not expected to get below it for another five years. Meanwhile, particulate pollution – the minute sooty particles mainly from traffic that get deep into the lungs – was shown to be linked to thousands of deaths every year. The London Assembly urged mayor Boris Johnstone to take action and the environment audit committee thundered that air pollution now costs £8.5-20bn per year and is leading to 4000 premature deaths a year. But the government avoided being sued by activist lawyers ClientEarth working with Clean Air London. Sadly, Environmental Protection UK, one of the world's oldest environment groups, folded as a national organisation in November after 114 years fighting air pollution. The bravest man of the year was surely comedian David Walliams who spent eight days swimming the Thames for charity in September. Within hours of starting he was violently ill, having caught a dose of water pollution. Happily it wasn't as bad as that which struck down and killed double Olympic gold medal winner Andy Holmes, who died only months before after catching a bacterial infection in a river. The irony, not lost on conservationists trying to protect river habitats, is that government can say that British rivers have never been cleaner in 100 years because they only measure some pollutants. In fact 75% fail new EU standards, nitrate levels are higher than they were 140 years ago and raw sewage regularly floods into the Thames and other rivers whenever there is a storm because the drains cannot cope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/02/japan-fukushima-radioactive-water-leaking-sea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-02T12:14:48Z","webTitle":"Radioactive water from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant is leaking into sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/02/japan-fukushima-radioactive-water-leaking-sea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/02/japan-fukushima-radioactive-water-leaking-sea","fields":{"headline":"Radioactive water from Japan's Fukushima plant is leaking into sea","bodyText":"Radioactive water from Japan's quake-striken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant is leaking into the sea, its operator said. The 20cm (8in) crack in a containment pit under reactor two may be the source of recent radiation in coastal waters, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) officials said. Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said Tepco was planning to pour concrete into the pit to seal the crack, which may have been leaking since the magnitude 9.0 earthquake three weeks ago. \"This could be one of the sources of seawater contamination,\" Nishiyama said. \"There could be other similar cracks in the area, and we must find them as quickly as possible.\" Readings released on Saturday showed radiation in seawater had spread to 25 miles (40km) south of the plant. The concentration of iodine there was twice the legal limit, but officials stressed it was still well below levels that are dangerous to human health. The announcement of the radioactive leak came as Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan surveyed the damage in the town of Rikuzentakata, which was gutted by the devastating tsunami that hit the country following the quake. The prime minister bowed his head for a minute of silence in front of the town hall, one of the few buildings still standing, which has all its windows blown out and debris piled up in front of it. \"The government fully supports you until the end,\" Kan later told 250 people at an elementary school that is serving as an evacuation centre. He met with the town's mayor, Megumi Shimanuki, whose 38-year-old wife was swept away in the wave and is still missing. Shimanuki, whose family is living in a similar shelter 100 miles (160km) away in Natori, said Kan did not spend enough time with people on the ground. \"The government has been too focused on the Fukushima power plant rather than the tsunami victims,\" said Shimanuki, 35. \"Both deserve attention.\" One member of the power plant crew described difficult conditions inside the complex in an interview in the Mainichi newspaper. He said the plant has run out of the nylon protective booties that workers put over their shoes. \"We only put something like plastic garbage bags you can buy at a convenience store and sealed them with masking tape,\" said the anonymous worker. He added that the grounds of the power plant were littered with dead fish churned up by the tsunami. Japanese media reported that nuclear workers had been offered up to 400,000 yen (£3,000) a day to work inside the crippled reactors. Before the crisis some contract workers were reportedly being paid as little as 10,000 to 20,000 yen (£75 to £150) a day. Three weeks after the tsunami more than 165,000 people are living in shelters, while 260,000 households still do not have running water and 170,000 do not have electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/13/pragmatic-approaches-to-nuclear-proliferation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-13T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Pragmatic approaches to nuclear proliferation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/pragmatic-approaches-to-nuclear-proliferation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/13/pragmatic-approaches-to-nuclear-proliferation","fields":{"headline":"Pragmatic approaches to nuclear proliferation","bodyText":"I feel it necessary to respond to the naive letter from Tony Benn et al (Letters, 10 November). Nuclear weapons are the greatest threat to human survival ever invented. Benn is old enough, as am I, to remember that some 150,000 human beings were evaporated in August 1945. What is not generally realised is that the weapons used in Japan were mere firecrackers compared to what is available today. We must now consider the instantaneous deaths of millions. The cause of non-proliferation was greatly hampered by the lies of Bush and Blair over Iraq. But there is a real and increasing threat. There is no military need or use for the horrible instruments. Not from Israel, and certainly not from the UK, where £25bn is foolishly allocated for their renewal. Israel is the only country with such arms whose very existence has been threatened by Iran. And Iran has directly violated the non-proliferation treaty for decades, not years, as carefully documented by David Albright and colleagues at the Institute for Science and International Security. The poison of weapon development has spread from North Korea to Libya, even to Syria, all regimes with the blood of their citizens on their hands. It is proliferation that is the huge threat. Every country that develops these weapons represents a huge increase in the threat to civilisation. Every weapon produced increases the possibility of their use, whether on purpose, by accident, or by terrorism. It is unlikely that Iran's programme can be stopped, and military action is useless, stupid and counterproductive. But no country should be allowed such production with immunity. Some international actions, probably in the form of diplomatic pressure and sanctions, are called for. Illegality which threatens the survival of the human race cannot be allowed to proceed unhindered. David Wolfe Director, Oppenheimer Institute for Science and International Co-operation • Simon Tisdall (Unmaking of a presidency, 9 November) makes a convincing case that US military action against Iran's nuclear facilities \"would be morally insupportable ... a rupture of faith\" by President Obama. Iranian opponents of the current clerical regime would surely agree. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, which helped expose details of Iran's nuclear programme, seeks regime change. But it explicitly rejects both foreign military intervention and continued appeasement in favour of regime change by the Iranian people. There are two things Obama can do about Iran without losing faith with those who welcomed his election. First he can pursue the tightest sanctions. Even without Chinese and Russian support, sanctions impact directly on members of the clerical regime and the Revolutionary Guard on which it depends for power, who between them control and profit from most of Iran's economy. The second is more pressing. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) needs to be allowed time and security to process the asylum applications of the 3,000-plus residents of Camp Ashraf. The Iraqi government insists the camp must close by the end of the year. But it appears to be obstructing UNHCR from starting work, insisting, for example, that interviews take place in Baghdad, where Ashraf residents have reason to fear for their safety. Extending the closure deadline, and stationing a UN force at Ashraf, would be sufficient to ensure their safe and early resettlement in third countries. In April, after the second attack on Ashraf, I wrote that we were \"waiting for President Obama's strong condemnation of the atrocities committed by Iraqi troops at Ashraf\" (Letters, 12 April). We are still waiting. Time is running out for international action to prevent an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. Martyn Storey Cambridge • Your editorial's defeatist acceptance of nuclear proliferation (Editorial, 10 November) was correct on one point: that the non-proliferation treaty is flawed. Its central delusion is it assumes nation states can be persuaded not to turn the knowledge learned in running nuclear power into developing nuclear weapons. India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea and potentially Iran illustrate the colossal folly of such an approach. You report on the same day that France's foreign minister Alain Juppé has called for sanctions against Tehran to be raised to an \"unprecedented scale\" (Russia rejects calls for more sanctions against Iran over nuclear programme, 10 October) and foreign secretary William Hague has told MPs: \"We must continue to increase the pressure [on Iran] and we are considering with our partners a range of additional measures.\" One immediate measure should be to insist that France wind up the extraordinary industrial partnership between the Iranian state Atomic Energy Organisation and the French state-owned nuclear fuels company, COGEMA, a joint venture in uranium enrichment. Development of policies for a nuclear-free future must be seen as a global priority. A crucial first step is to follow Germany's lead and halt the building of new nuclear power plants worldwide. Dr David Lowry and Colin Hines Co-founders, European Proliferation Information Centre • The Guardian is to be congratulated for its brave suggestion that governments take a pragmatic approach to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Unfortunately, its voice is unlikely to be heard above those with a hysterical dread of the regional consequences of a nuclear Iran, and the dreamers who cling to the impossibility of global nuclear disarmament. While efforts to limit proliferation must continue, my fear is that the hopelessly biased and poorly observed nuclear non-proliferation treaty will cause greater damage than it is likely to prevent. In a world where climate change and financial collapse are clear and present threats, we will have to accept that nuclear weapons are among the global risks we must learn to live with. Dr Brian Jones Author of Failing Intelligence • The letter above from David Wolfe, director of the Oppenheimer Institute for Science and International Co-operation, was corrected on 14 November.

For 30 years, Finns have picked a Social Democrat to be their president. Green and gay candidates are still something of a novelty. But Pekka Haavisto has experienced something of an Obama moment in the election. He caused a shock in last month's first round of voting by beating more established candidates from bigger parties to qualify for this weekend's runoff vote. Haavisto is something of a rarity in Finnish politics, an openly gay politician living in a registered partnership with a man from Ecuador. On Sunday the Finns will decide if he can beat the current favourite, Sauli Niinistö. On a cold afternoon at Hakaniemi Square in central Helsinki, a 50-strong crowd braved the weather to hear Haavisto speak. Anu Korppi-Koskela, 31, went along with her daughter. \"Antonio would be an excellent first lady,\" said Korppi-Koskela, referring to Antonio Flores, Haavisto's partner, a hairdresser in Helsinki who has become a favourite subject for the Finnish tabloids. \"Twelve years ago the Finns were wondering whether a woman who wasn't married could become our president. Now, it seems almost funny that people raised those concerns. I think in six or 12 years' time we will look back and think that it was funny that this was an issue.\" For many Finns, Haavisto's sexuality is a curiosity rather than a problem. Haavisto is offering an alternative to more established candidates who have done the rounds in the Finnish presidential election for years. He appeals to younger voters who feel ignored by the other parties. Many now feel it was this unease with the political mainstream that led to an unusual result in the parliamentary elections last year, in which the rightwing Eurosceptic True Finns emerged as the third largest party. In turn, the support for Haavisto is seen by some as a backlash against the swing to the intolerant right. \"If you can say 'my president can be gay' it means the time is right for it. It would make Finland look like a very advanced and modern country,\" said another supporter, 29-year-old Merja Nevala. But Haavisto still has a long way to go if he is to win the runoff on Sunday. His opponent, Sauli Niinistö of the moderate right Kokoomus party, has widely been seen as the president-in-waiting for the past six years. Whatever the election outcome, it will be the first time in 30 years that the Finnish president will not be a Social Democrat. It is also the first time a Green party candidate has gained any major support in a Finnish election, perhaps because Haavisto has been downplaying his green credentials. \"The Greens are considered a bit annoying. I support the Green party myself, but I realise this,\" said Nevala. \"That's why you haven't seen any green colour on his posters or websites. They have kept a bit quiet about the party and I think it has been a very clever choice.\" The Finnish Green party, which Haavisto helped found in the 1980s, is mainly known for campaigns against nuclear power and has often placed itself in the Eurosceptic camp during elections. Haavisto was the party chairman in the mid 90s and has spent large parts of his career leading the UN environment programme in areas including Darfur and the Balkans, investigating the impact of war on people's living conditions. He and Niinistö hardly differ in terms of foreign policy, an area in which the Finnish president has some power. Both are pro-EU and support the euro bailout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-crisis-industry-revival","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T20:43:39Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear crisis puts industry revival in doubt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-crisis-industry-revival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-crisis-industry-revival","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear crisis puts industry revival in doubt","bodyText":"Events in Japan could kill the last chances of revival for an American nuclear industry struggling to emerge from the shadow of its own disaster at Three Mile Island, experts have predicted. Renewed fears about the technology may also snuff out a nuclear renaissance worldwide that had been sparked by fears over climate change and a need for low-carbon energy. \"This is going to be a Three Mile Island moment – maybe not a Chernobyl moment, but a Three Mile Island moment that is going to give people pause for at least several years,\" said Alan Madian, an energy analyst at the Brattle consulting group. \"There is no question that the public is going to be rightfully concerned.\" So far, the White House and Republicans are united in saying it would be premature to rethink plans for the first expansion of nuclear power in America since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. In Europe, a meeting of EU energy ministers in Brussels on Tuesday agreed a series of \"stress tests\" for European nuclear facilities in response to the Japanese alert to check they could withstand a variety of different shocks, from earthquakes to terrorist attacks. However, even as the crisis in Japan unfolds, investors appear already to be turning away from the technology. \"Shares in renewable energy industries yesterday rose while most other energy stocks fell,\" said Clare Brook, fund manager of leading green investment group WHEB, in London. \"This tragedy comes on top of the oil price rise, the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and unrest in the Middle East, all of which has made renewables more attractive. We would expect investment in renewables, especially solar, to increase. Nuclear has become politically unacceptable.\" The revival of nuclear energy had come partly on the back of fears about climate change and a need for reliable low-carbon energy sources. That revival may now be in doubt, but leading environmentalists who have backed the technology as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels said the accident should not slow new nuclear investment. The scientist James Lovelock said: \"There is a monstrous myth about nuclear power. I would make a strong guess that of the tens of thousands of people killed in Japan, none of them will be from nuclear power.\" He said people were unreasonably prejudiced against nuclear power. \"It is very safe,\" he said. Mark Lynas, another environmental campaigner who has espoused nuclear power as a way to limit climate change, was pessimistic about how nuclear power would be perceived after the Japanese experience. \"It's too early to make a final diagnosis of what is happening in Japan, but what is obvious is that this will be a colossal setback for the nuclear industry at just the moment at which climate change is sparking a real renaissance,\" he said. In Europe a new caution towards nuclear power was led by Germany, which said seven reactors that went into operation before 1980 would be offline for three months while Europe's biggest economy reconsiders its plans to extend the life of its atomic power plants. The European Union's energy commissioner called for a reassessment of what role nuclear power should have in the future. \"We have to ask ourselves: can we in Europe, within time, secure our energy needs without nuclear power plants?\" Günther Oettinger told ARD television in Germany. He invited non-EU countries to join the initiative, including Switzerland, which announced on Monday that it was halting plans for new reactors. Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, accused other European governments of \"rushing to judgments\" over the safety of nuclear power and took a public swipe at \"continental politicians\" hours after the German announcement. Nevertheless, he insisted he was right to order a UK safety review amid warnings from MPs it could hit investment in a planned new generation of domestic nuclear power stations. Elsewhere, a commitment to a nuclear future was affirmed by the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said he had no plans to suspend a deal with Russia's Rosatom agency for the construction of Turkey's first nuclear power plant. Dismissing questions on possible dangers, Erdogan said all investments had high risks. \"In that case, let's not bring gas canisters to our homes, let's not install natural gas, let's not stream crude oil through our country,\" he said. Russia also signed a deal with Belarus to build a nuclear power station there. Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin said the facility would be safer than that threatened by meltdown in Japan. In the US, political proponents of nuclear power also remained steadfast. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who has called for building 100 reactors in the next 20 years, called on America to cling fast to the nuclear dream. \"We don't abandon highway systems because bridges and overpasses collapse during earthquakes,\" he said in a speech to the Senate. \"The 1.6 million of us who fly daily would not stop flying after a tragic plane crash. We would find out what happened and do our best to make it safe.\" One pro-nuclear congressman, Devin Nunes, a California Republican who has called for 200 new reactors by 2040, went so far as to suggest that the crisis in Japan demonstrated the safety of nuclear power. \"The facts, as we know them today, are not an indictment of nuclear energy safety,\" he said. \"Quite the reverse is true. The survival of the 40-year-old containment systems under such extreme conditions helps to prove the safety and durability of nuclear power.\" In reality, America's nuclear industry has been in a state of suspended animation since Three Mile Island. The economics of energy production in the US - which has cheap fossil fuels and has resisted putting a price on carbon - have made it difficult to plot a comeback Now industry's efforts to extend the life of a generation of ageing reactors - once thought a sure thing - could be in doubt. Some of those reactors, such as the Vermont Yankee, have a history of safety lapses and face growing local opposition. Nuclear regulators gave the plant an additional 20 years to run on Thursday - just a day before the quake. The plant has the same containment design as the failed reactors in Japan. Now Vermont's governor, Peter Shumlin, says he will push to close the plant on schedule in 2012. \"We act as if they can be run beyond their design life, when the engineering is primitive compared to what one would build today,'' he told reporters. \"I think the tragedy in Japan should awaken a re-examination of our irrational exuberance about running our aging plants beyond their design life.\" The Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the Japanese power company and other industry interests, had also been fighting hard to convince the public that reactors could help get America off imported oil. According to Opensecrets.org, which examines the influence of money in politics, the NEI has more than 20 lobbyists on staff. It has spent more than $6 million trying to influence Congress in the last three years. Individual power companies have also expanded their lobbying spending. Southern Company, which has a project to build two new reactors in Georgia, has spent $10 million a year on lobbying since 2004.But - so far at least - the industry has little to show for its efforts. Aside from Southern Company's two reactors - which have yet to get final approval from regulators - there are only two other new nuclear reactors in the works, in South Carolina in 2020. Another project, in Maryland, is in peril after a French company EDF pulled out. \"A nuclear bubble is what I've been calling it,\" said Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \"It was dead in the water even before the events of the last week and of course it's worse off now.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/23/mitt-romney-rick-santorum-arizona-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-23T04:45:00Z","webTitle":"Romney and Santorum trade barbs in Arizona debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/23/mitt-romney-rick-santorum-arizona-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/23/mitt-romney-rick-santorum-arizona-debate","fields":{"headline":"Romney and Santorum trade barbs in Arizona debate","bodyText":"Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum traded accusations over federal spending, contraception, the bailout of the car industry and healthcare reform on Wednesday night in what may have been the last in a series of televised debates stretching back to May last year. Romney and Santorum are about the last two standing from a bruising and protracted campaign to choose a Republican nominee to take on Barack Obama in November. Both sought to deliver a telling blow ahead of Tuesday's Michigan and Arizona primaries but neither could manage it. Failure to win Michigan would be a major humiliation for Romney as it is his home state and would seriously damage his chances of winning the nomination. Santorum badly needs a win to build on the momentum he created earlier this month with victories in Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri and his supporters will view the debate as a missed opportunity. The debate in Meza, Arizona, was the twentieth and possibly the last. Although a debate is scheduled for Portland, Oregon, in March, there are doubts about whether it will go ahead. The early debates were marred by having too many candidates, with time only for soundbites, but Arizona suffered from having two candidates who have been battling too long and who were too familiar with each other's policies, squabbling over minor details, frequently nitpicking and fabricating points. Although former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas congressman Ron Paul were also on stage, they were left largely on the sidelines. Gingrich, who has been fading since his victory in South Carolina in January, needed to dominate as he had done with earlier debates but could not impose himself. Santorum came off marginally the worse in his sparring with Romney. He became bogged down in a long, rambling defence of his votes for 'earmark' spending while a senator, an answer that could lose him conservative support, incensed by what they see as wasteful spending on projects such as Alaska's infamous \"Bridge to Nowhere\". Romney, asked to respond, replied contemptously: \"I didn't follow all that.\" Romney, who highlights on his CV his intervention on behalf of the Olympics in Salt Lake City, produced the soundbite of the night, telling Santorum: \"When I was fighting to save the Olympics, you were fighting to save the Bridge to Nowhere.\" Santorum, frustrated at the direction the debate was going, petutantly said to Romney: \"You don't know what you're talking about.\" Santorum was shouted down at frequent points during the debate by an audience dominated by Romney supporters. Santorum came close to acknowledging he had not had a good night when he said afterwards: \"This is Romney's town and a Romney crowd.\" Andy Tobin, the Arizona House speaker and a spokesman for the Romney campaign, said: \"Santorum said earmarks are OK. It is not OK. I think he missed a great opportunity tonight.\" But it was not a good night for Romney either. Like Santorum on earmarks, he waffled over his opposition to federal bailouts for the car industry and that could hurt him in Michigan, headquarters of the country's biggest auto manufacturers. He also shifted to the right at several points with policies aimed at winning over conservatives in Arizona. He said the Arizona model for dealing with illegal immigration, regarded by the Obama administration as draconian, should be adopted by the whole country. That could help Romney in the Arizona primary but damage him in a general election, particularly with Latino voters. One moment of light relief in an otherwise plodding debate came when each candidate was asked to sum themselves up in one word. Paul went for \"consistent\", Santorum \"courage\", Romney \"resolute\" and Gingrich \"cheerful\". On foreign policy, Romney, Santorum and Gingrich were adamant Iran would not be allowed to become a nuclear power, while Paul dissented, saying there was no evidence it was seeking a nuclear weapon capability. On social issues, Romney challenged Santorum's credentials as anti-abortionist, saying he had backed former senator Arlen Specter, a supporter of abortion rights. Romney went further, saying that Santorum, through his support of Specter, had helped bring about healthcare reform, a contentious and obscure point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-blow-to-cheap-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-09T20:21:20Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: A blow to the cheap coal option | Bryony Worthington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-blow-to-cheap-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/09/nuclear-blow-to-cheap-coal","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: A blow to the cheap coal option","bodyText":"Today's announcements are meant to bring clarity to an otherwise murky situation. The government is trying to pave the way for an energy system in which electricity generation is more or less fully decarbonised by 2050. The three technologies that can help achieve this are renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage. With renewables – already healthily subsidised – the main obstacle to investment has been planning and getting access to the grid. The new Infrastructure Planning Commission is an attempt to depoliticise the planning hurdle, and today's remarks are intended to make it clear that energy projects such as these are in the national interest. For nuclear, the industry is still more or less sticking to the line that it doesn't need a special subsidy. But it has needed public underwriting of decommissioning costs and, to avoid the two-year planning delay that Sizewell B faced, it too needs the planning system to be overhauled. Today's statement again moves in that direction. On the coal front it is not so much planning that is an issue as the lack of commercial confidence in the technology and the high costs of building the infrastructure and operating the equipment. Today's announcement effectively rules out the possibility of any new coal stations being built without around a quarter of the station being fitted with fully operational capture and storage technology from the outset. This is a blow to anyone thinking that current cheap coal technologies are on their list of options when it comes to building new capacity. The government has recognised the role clear regulation can play in getting what it wants. The big question is: are the policies clear enough to get companies investing in the right technologies?

Can you explain why postal workers were told they couldn't sell their shares for three years but hedge funds were told they could cash in on day one? Miliband also said that George Osborne's best man ran one of the hedge funds involved. It's one rule if you deliver the chancellor's best man speech and another if you deliver the chancellor's post. David Cameron defended the sale. This is a good deal for taxpayers because this business was losing a billion. It is now making money, paying taxes, gaining in value - good for our country but bad for Labour. • John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has cut Cameron off at PMQs during one of Cameron's answers, saying he had said enough. • Boris Johnson has said he has been given a personal assurance by Cameron that a Tory government would legislate to introduce a 50% threshold for strike ballots affecting the Tube. • Cameron has criticised Alex Salmond for saying that he admired certain aspects of Vladmir Putin's leadership. This is what he said when asked about this at PMQs. I agree wholeheartedly with you. I think what Alex Salmond said was a major error of judgement. I think all of us in this House should be supporting the Ukrainian desire to be a sovereign, independent country and to have the respect of the international community and party leaders for that ambition. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, also criticised Salmond during a visit to Edinburgh. If Alex Salmond had been the leader of an independent EU member state, which is what he wants to be, and had made those comments, they would be completely at odds with the views expressed by every other European government. I think it would put Scotland in a pretty difficult position. The main issue is that clearly a lot of offence has been caused to an important community here in Edinburgh and that has to be addressed. For a defence of Salmond's remarks, this is worth a read. • Cameron has criticised the Lib Dems for not having more senior women in government. This is what he said when asked about the number of women in his government at PMQs. What I said is I wanted to see a third of my front bench ministers being women at the end of a Conservative government. We have made some important progress in terms of the numbers of people on the front bench. I have to say, with respect to my coalition partner, that in terms of cabinet numbers the Liberal Democrats need to do a bit more to pull their weight on this issue. But I hope to be making further progress. • Cameron has described Henry V's speech before Agincourt as one of his favourite's pieces of Shakespeare. This is what he said when he was asked about the bard at PMQs. I would say to any politician, if you read Henry V's speech before Agincourt - if that doesn't inspire and drive you on, I can't think what does. • Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that police stop and search powers are to be overhauled with a revised code of conduct. • The Office of National Statistics has said that the number of UK jobs offered on zero-hours contracts is 1.4m, a far higher number than expected. • The Unite union has said it will ballot its council worker members on strike action. Unite's national officer Fiona Farmer said: Our members have decisively rejected the insulting pay offer of 1% and send a very strong message to local government employers that they need to increase their offer. • Councils in England are to get stronger powers to prevent \"harm\" being done by a \"concentration\" of bookmakers on high streets, the government has announced. • The SNP has launched its European election campaign, saying it wants to \"ensure that Scotland's interests are always defended\" in Brussels. • Sir Robert Rogers, the clerk of the House of Commons, has announced he is retiring. In a letter announcing his decision, read to MPs by John Bercow, he paid tribute to their work. The House of Commons across the centuries has never expected to be popular and indeed it should not court popularity. But the work it does in calling governments to account and its role as a crucible of ideas and challenge deserves to be better known, better understood and so properly valued. So too does the work of individual members, not only working for the interests of their constituencies and constituents but often as the last resort of the homeless and hopeless - the people whom society has let down. This is a worthy calling and should be properly acknowledged and appreciated. MPs applauded him after the letter was read out. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A new poll suggests Ukip are soaring ahead in the European elections. These are the figures from a ComRes poll for ITN released today, showing the voting intention of those who say they are certain to vote. Ukip: 38% (up 8 points from ComRes in early April) Labour: 27% (down 3) Conservatives: 18% (down 4) Lib Dems: 8% (no change) And here is what journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. I have not seen many tweets giving a clear winner. For Cameron Here are some saying or implying Cameron won. For Miliband Here are some saying or implying Miliband won. Other comments This piece implies it was a draw. And here are some other interesting comments. PMQs Verdict: Before Easter Ed Miliband had a hit at PMQs by attacking David Cameron over the privatisation of Royal Mail. He returned to the theme again today, and again he had an easy win. Ministers have been struggling to defend the Royal Mail privatisation ever since day one of the flotation, when the share price shot up by 38%. Then came the NAO report accusing the government of being too cautious in the way it priced the shares. Miliband was also assisted today by the revelations that emerged yesterday about a hedge fund with Tory links being involved, and by the comments from Brian Binley, the Conservative MP who condemned the sale in the Commons business committee. But Miliband framed his questions well, and his point about postal worker having to hold on to their shares, while hedge funds were allowed to sell them immediately, was a powerful one. Cameron only made a half-hearted attempt to engage with the questions (normally a clear sign that he's losing), and instead fell back upon a fairly bland point about Miliband resorting to conventional, Old Labour anti-privatisation rhetoric. The problem for Cameron is that, if a stance is popular, whether or not it's Old Labour doesn't matter. So, Miliband clearly won. Ironically, though, after spending more than two hours yesterday listening to Vince Cable, Michael Fallon and two of the key advisers involved defend the Royal Mail privatisation, I came away open to the idea that the sale wasn't quite the disaster it is being made out to be. I won't rehearse the arguments here, but you can read them on yesterday's blog from the business committee. The hearing established that those with expertise in how an IPO operates (Cable et al) have an entirely different perspective from the rest of us (including many of the business committee) for whom this is all a bit of a mystery. Sir Peter Tapsell tried to make the same point this afternoon (see 12.20pm), and he did a rather better job of Cameron. But it was no use. Whatever the technical rights and wrongs of the handling of the flotation, in a populist forum like PMQs you will never successfully defend a sale that led to £750m flowing from the taxpayer into the hands of City investors. Cameron was doomed from the moment he stood up. That was one of the longest PMQs I can recall. It went over time by seven minutes. John Bercow said he allowed so much \"injury time\" because of all the interruptions. He is now making a statement about Sir Robert Rogers, the clerk of the Commons, retiring in the summer. Anne Main, a Conservative, asks Cameron if he will look at cutting stamp duty. Cameron says the government has decided to use Help to Buy as its means of helping people buy homes. Fiona MacTaggart, the Labour MP, says two thirds of local councils are cutting their street lights at night. Are women safe at night? Cameron says he has been lobbied on this, by both sides. It should be a matter for local councils, he says. Labour's George Howarth says the use of food banks in his constituency has increased hugely. Will Cameron accept that government policies are driving this? Cameron says the best route out of poverty is work. Food bank use has gone up. That is partly because the government promotes them more. But the OECD has produced figures showing that food poverty is actually lower than it was. Labour are trying to paint a picture that is \"wholly false\". Labour's Sheila Gilmore asks Cameron to condemn Alex Salmond's statement about admiring certain aspects of Vladimir Putin's rule. Cameron says what Salmond said was \"a major error of judgment\". Lorely Burt, a Lib Dem, asks about a film about female genital mutilation. And Lib Dem women punch above their weight, she says (referring to Cameron's earlier comment about the lack of female Lib Dem ministers). Cameron says the government will put the FGM issue up the agenda. Labour's Katy Clark asks Cameron if he will make representations on behalf of the two princesses held under house arrest in Saudi Arabia. Cameron says he has read the reports on this, and shares Clark's concerns. He says the government makes representations on these issues. Mark Hendrick, the Labour MP, asks about nuclear energy. It is the greenest power available, he says. Cameron says Labour was in power for 13 years but did not build a nuclear power station, or make any progress towards one. Now Hinkley Point is going ahead, he says. Labour's Sharon Hodgson asks about last week's report from the all party group on ticket touts. Does he agree with it, or with Sajid Javid, the new culture secretary, who has defended touts? Cameron says he has not read the report. But he will be happy to look at it, he says. Cameron says 1.6m apprentices have started under the government. Mark Lazarowicz, the Labour MP, says Cameron said he would put a wind turbine on Number 10 if elected. But now he has changed his mind on wind. Why? Cameron says there has been a massive expansion of wind energy. So now it is right to give local communities more powers to block wind farms, he says. Jason McCartney, a Conservative, asks about a job fare in his constituency. Cameron says job fares have been a good thing. Business confidence is at its highest level, he says. Nadhim Zahawi, the Stratford-upon-Avon MP, asks if Cameron will make Shakespeare's birthday a holiday. And what does Shakespeare mean to him? Cameron says that any politician should be inspired by Henry V's speech on the eve of Agincourt. Labour's Siobhain McDonagh mentions a constituent who wants to join the policy but who cannot afford the £1,000 \"bobby tax\" (a fee for joining a professional body). Cameron says people who join the police can get assistance towards the cost of this. Sir Peter Tapsell, a Conservative, says he led the stokebroking firm that brought British Gas to market. And he was author of the \"Tell Sid\" campaign. Ed Miliband's questions show their \"total ignorance\" of City markets, he says. When you are trying to make an immense sale, you have to find people to underwrite it. But they cannot predict what the market will say in a week. If you're issue sales, those institutions responsible are ruined. (That question went on for ages. But Bercow indulged him. He is generally quite soft on the father of the House.) Cameron says Tapsell makes an important point. Cameron says the Lib Dems need to do more to pull their weight in terms of getting women into government. Snap PMQs Verdict: A clean, easy and rather stylish win for Miliband - and a spectacular performance by John Bercow, who probably managed to infuriate Labour and the Tories in equal measure. Miliband says it is one rule fo rthe postal workers, and another rule for hedge funds. Who runs them? The chancellor's best man. It is one rule if you deliver the chancellor's best man speech. And another if you deliver his post. Cameron says Miliband cannot talk about the deficit. He can only talk about issues that appeal to the unions. He has nothing to say about the long-term economic plan. Miliband says there is a cost of living crisis in this country. The more we know about this privatisation, the more of a fiasco it appears. Everything about this privatisation stinks, he says. Cameron says Milband has a new adviser from America. David Axelrod says we must not go backwards to the policies that put us in the mess in the first place. John Bercow says \"order\". Cameron says he has not finished. Bercow tells him, in response to that question, he has finished. Miliband says this was a \"rip off of the taxpayer\". The British people know it when they see it. The sale was grossly undervalued. Shares sold for £1.7bn. Now they are worth £2.7bn. Yesterday the representative of the bank that sold the shares said there was an understanding about their long-term commitment. Why were they allowed to make a quick buck. Cameron says we are getting lectures from people who lost money selling gold. These are the arguments that Michael Foot made about the privatisation of the National Freight Corporation. And Neil Kinnock used similar arguments. This is playing to the gallery. Miliband can't talk about the economy. Miliband says Cameron should listen to Tory MPs. He quotes Brian Binley, who criticised it in the hearing with Vince Cable. There were no conditions on the hedge funds. But there were conditions on postal workers. Why could they not sell shares for three years, but hedge funds could sell them after day one. Cameron says postal workers were given their shares; they did not buy them. John Bercow interrupts. He says Fiona MacTaggart is a product of Cheltenham Ladies College. He cannot believe she was taught to behave like this there. Cameron says Labour MPs' children, like \"son of Kinnock\", are coming back to the Commons. It is literally the same old Labour. Ed Miliband starts with his own tributes to the dead servicemen, and to Ann Maguire. Her death was an appalling tragedy, he says. Yesterday we learnt the names of some of the investors given preferential access to Royal Mail shares. How were they chosen? Cameron says this was an exercise that has been a success. A business that lost £1b under Labour is now making a profit. We should be praising shareholders. Miliband says Cameron did not answer the question. Only Cameron would want congratulating for losing the taxpayer so much money. These preferential bidders were given more shares than other people. Vince Cable said they would not be \"spivs\". What assurances did they give about holding shares? Cameron says there was no agreement. The business is making money, and succeeding for shareholders. Miliband is reduced to complaining about a successful privatisation. Roger Williams, the Lib Dem MP for Brecon, pays tribute to Oliver Thomas, the reservist who worked for Williams at Westminster. Cameron says this looks like a tragic accident. Reservists take all the risks that ordinary servicemen do, he says. Labour's Gareth Thomas asks about tuition fees. Is this a disastrous policy a symbol of the long-term economic plan? Cameron says the policy is about expanding entry to higher education. David Cameron starts by paying tribute to the five servicemen killed in the Afghanistan helicopter crash. One of them was a reservist who worked as an assistant to the Brecon MP, Roger Williams, he says. He also pays tribute to Ann Maguire, the teacher killed in Leeds I don't know what the Speaker's statement is about, I'm afraid. PMQs is starting shortly. John Curtice, the psephologist, told BBC News earlier that he could understand why Nigel Farage decided not to stand in Newark. If you actually look at [Newark], you find that Ukip would need a 25% swing from the Conservatives to themselves to be ahead of the Conservatives in the constituency. The biggest swing that they have managed so far in any parliamentary byelection was the 19% they got in Eastleigh. But there's a crucial difference between Eastleigh and Newark. In Eastleigh there was already quite a considerable local vote for Ukip. It's a rather unusual place; they've been standing candidates for quite a while. In contrast, in Newark, the party did quite well in last year's local elections, around 17/18%, but that 17/18% was below the round 25% or so that Ukip was getting on average in that spectacular performance 12 months ago. Which is indicative that this is not necessarily somewhere where Ukip would necessarily expect to do particularly well. And then there's another complication. Normally when this kind of byelection is called, you say to yourself, could Labour get it? And certainly if you look at the kind of swings Labour was getting in byelections before 1997, then actually Newark looks, at least, potentially winnable for Labour. In other words, even if Ukip manage to overtake the Conservatives, we might still discover that it's Labour that picked up the seat. Curtice's figure for the biggest swing to Ukip is not the same as the one Patrick quoted earlier. (See 11.11am.) I'll try to clarify this later. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today’s paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here’s the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here’s the ConservativeHome round-up of the politics stories in today’s papers and here’s the New Statesman’s list of top 10 comment articles. And here are three articles I found particularly interesting. • Mary Riddell in the Telegraph says Nigel Farage is currently benefiting from discontent about inequality, not Ed Miliband. With Ukip now the narrow favourite to win the European elections, its leader is the beneficiary of the public’s anger at being left behind while the rich get ever richer. When Mr Miliband launches Labour’s campaign tomorrow, he will know that many of his allies think it possible or likely that Mr Farage will relegate him to second place. That result, leaving the Tories as also-rans, would deliver an ominous portent. As Marcus Roberts, deputy general secretary of the Fabians, says: “Ukip can deny David Cameron the keys to Downing Street. But it can also deny Ed Miliband an overall majority.” That prospect has thrown Labour into disarray. Some leading figures counsel a cross-party attack on a “racist” Ukip, while others warn that insults merely benefit non-stick Nigel. Some argue that Labour easily trounced Ukip in the recent Wythenshawe by-election, while others rightly warn that a slickly managed city campaign cannot be replicated in coastal redoubts. Even Mr Miliband’s wisest allies sound flummoxed. As one says: “Farage is drawing a line between him and everyone else.” Much as the Labour leader may try to shift the focus back to TV debates with Mr Cameron, Mr Farage continues, for now at least, to stake his claim with the blue-collar voters that Labour once forgot. • Daniel Finkelstein in the Times (paywall) says the Cyril Smith story is worrying because the corrupt celebrity local politician could be making a comeback. Smith is in many ways a very contemporary figure, belonging to the new era of less respectful, less manageable MPs. He hated parliament and rarely attended. He was a celebrity figure as independent from party whipping as it was possible to imagine. He said what local people thought and not what national leaders wanted him to say. He cultivated his local base and was deeply entangled with everything that went on there. His relationship with the police, with local councillors, with local business, with the care system, was so close as to be deeply unhealthy ... Smith was a master at taking hold of small moribund institutions, such as the Rochdale Liberal party, and exploiting it, using his strong personality to grip it. Now all political parties are about as small as the Liberal party once was. While the particular variety of sexual crime that Smith committed might be harder to get away with now, the same might not be true of his dubious financial deals. And certainly not of his crony hold on power. It is optimistic to believe that in a new era of mavericks and local personality politics, transparency alone will be a sufficient shield against corruption. The Cyril Smith story is not about the politics we are running away from; it’s about the politics we are running towards. • The Independent says the Department for Business has admitted that \"hedge funds were among the 'priority investors' sold hundreds of millions of pounds of shares [in Royal Mail]\". The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, has repeatedly insisted that the handful of key investors offered Royal Mail shares on preferential terms were long-term institutional investors. This was to ensure the new company started with “a core of high-quality investors” who “would be there in good times and bad”. He promised to marginalise “spivs and speculators”. But sources in the Department for Business have confirmed to The Independent that around 20 per cent of the shares it had allocated to 16 preferred investors had gone to hedge funds and other short-term investors. This would equate to around £150m of Royal Mail shares – 13 per cent of the entire stock sold by the Government. The companies bought in at the float price of 330p a share. The shares shot up within seconds of trading, eventually peaking within weeks at more than 600p, allowing the hedge funds to bank vast profits at the taxpayers’ expense. My colleague Patrick Wintour has written his take on Nigel Farage's decision not to stand in Newark. Here's an extract. The psephology of Newark was not propitious for Ukip. It came fourth in the 2010 general election with its candidate scoring 4% of the vote. In order for Ukip to win, there would have to be a net swing of 25% from Conservative to Ukip. The biggest Ukip swings in this parliament have been 24.2% in South Shields, 24.2% in Eastleigh, 15.9% in Rotherham, and 14.4% in Wythenshaw &amp; Sale East; the Conservative fall was only 22% even in Bradford South ... Finally, if Farage had stood, taking even more of the Tory vote than a local Ukip candidate, but then allowed Labour to slip through the middle to capture the seat, it would have been a living example of the argument David Cameron plans to make at the general election – a vote for Ukip puts Miliband into Number 10. There is also a deeper calculation for Farage. Does he really want the letters \"MP\" after his name before 2015? Does he want to look like every other politician, in a suit standing up at prime minister's questions banging on about Europe? If his appeal is that he is the none-of-the-above candidate, regular footage from the Westminster chamber reminding voters that he is one of the above is hardly ideal. The rebel would have been institutionalised. Here is some blog comment on Newark and Nigel Farage's decision. • James Forsyth at Coffee House says it has now become more important for Ukip to win the European elections. There’s much chatter about Farage being ‘frit’ this morning. Frankly, if Ukip top the polls in the European Elections—as another poll has them on course to this morning—all this will be irrelevant. Ukip will have had its breakthrough moment and the Newark by-election will be fought on its terms. But if Ukip don’t come top in the Europeans, and with Farage not running in Newark, then there’ll be a sense that Ukip has missed its moment. The stakes for Ukip on May 22nd could not be higher. • Janet Daley at the Telegraph says Farage made the right decision. A very safe seat with a strong constituency organisation would have been the worst possible place to make a real dent in the Tories' electoral credibility. What this shows us is that Nigel – and his people – are professionals at this game. They are making tactical judgments that will stand up in the heat. Which means they are more of a threat in the medium and long-term to both the mainstream parties than a lot of people might have expected. • Benedict Brogan at the Telegraph says Farage was right to realise that his prospect in Newark were slim, but that a \"Ukip breakthrough at Westminster is no nearer\". • @election_data looks at the demographic profile of Newark. In other news, the Office of National Statistics has this morning published new figures suggesting that the number of people on zero-hour contracts is higher than previously thought - and could be close to 1.4m. This is far higher than the previous estimate (around 600,000). But that's because the previous number was based on the number of employees who say they are on zero-hour contracts. The new figure is based on a survey of employers, and it shows how many zero-hour contracts are actually in place. The number is 1.4m, but some individuals will be working for more than one employer on a zero-hour contract, so that actual number of employees covered by these arrangements is almost certainly a bit lower. Here's an extract from the ONS news release. The provisional estimate from the ONS survey of 5,000 businesses indicates that in January to February 2014 there were around 1.4 million employee contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of hours, which provided work in the survey reference period of the fortnight beginning 20 January 2014. This is the official ONS estimate based on a survey of businesses. The most recent estimate, published on 19 February 2014, of the number of people who are employed on “zero-hours contracts” in their primary employment, from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) of individuals in households, is 583,000, for the period October to December 2013. This relates specifically to the individual’s perceptions of whether they are employed on the specific type of contract – a “zero-hours contract”. Estimates from employers are likely to be higher than those from individuals for a number of reasons. Employers may be more aware of formal contractual arrangements of their employees. In addition, one person can hold more than one contract and/or there may be people working on such a contract in addition to their primary employment and/or their working patterns may mean they do not consider themselves to be covered by such a contract. However, even if it were possible to take account of all these factors, it remains unlikely that the two estimates would be the same. This is because they are based on the perceptions of two different groups. And here is the paper with the full details (pdf). Losing in Newark would not necessarily have been a disaster for Nigel Farage. As Alastair Stewart pointed out last night, Roy Jenkins fought and lost a byelection for the SDP in Warrington in 1981 - but counted it as a great victory because his very good second place showing gave the SDP a considerable boost. Here are the main points from the various interviews that Nigel Farage has been giving this morning. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. • Farage suggest that Ukip's ambition was now to get enough MPs elected in 2015 to hold the balance of power. There is a much bigger prize than the Newark by-election, and that is the general election in 2015, when we won’t be thinking about winning one seat; we’ll be thinking about getting a decent number of people elected into Westminster and – who knows? – possibly even holding the balance of power. So this is about a lot more than Newark and it’s about a lot more than just me. • He said he would not be standing in Newark because doing so would be a distraction from Ukip's European election campaign. If he were the Newark candidate, he would have \"kissed goodbye\" to the European campaign, he said. • He said that standing in Newark would reinforce the impression that Ukip was a one-man band. It is not, he said. • He said that, because he has no links with the east Midlands, he would have looked like an \"opportunists\". Voters would prefer a local candidate, he said. The last five by-elections to Westminster that have taken place in the north of England, we’ve picked local candidates and nearly always working-class candidates so that’s one of the reasons we’ve done well. • He said Ukip would \"throw the kitchen sink\" at the Newark byelection. • He said Ukip had \"a very good chance of winning\" in the constituency. • He rejected claims that he had decided not to stand because he was afraid of losing. I’m a fighter, I’m a warrior, but you have to pick your battles in life and I am determined to finish off the job of the European elections, for us not to be distracted. According to Political Betting's Mike Smithson, Ladbrokes have tightened the odds on the Conservatives winning Newark following Nigel Farage's announcement he will not be standing. On Twitter Conservative and Labour MPs and peers have been taunting Nigel Farage for not standing. They all say much the same thing, but I will post a selection anyway. It is interesting to see quite how much glee they feel about Nigel Farage walking away from a contest he would probably lose. But these tweets do seem a touch hubristic. I expect the authors will be adopting a different tone when the results of the European elections come in. From Conservatives From Labour Paul Flynn certainly isn't adopting the official Labour line here. I had a text message from a Labour official before 7am this morning pointing out that winning in Newark would be hugely difficult. The Tories were 30 points ahead of Labour in 2010, they had double the Labour vote in the 2013 council elections, and Newark is the Tories' 44th safest seat. Farage says he has not bottled it. Eamonn Holmes says that earlier he asked Farage if he had bottled it, and he said he had. Farage says good generals don't fight every battle. Q: This is the wrong seat at the wrong time. Farage says it is the wrong seat for him. He has said that, at the general election, he is more likely to stand in Kent. People do not want a London candidate, he says. Nigel Farage is now being interviewed on Sky. Q: Did you know your decision before you went to bed last night? No, says Farage. But he did wake up early. Q: And are you definitely standing in the general election? Yes, says Farage. He hopes Ukip can hold the balance of power. Q: Do you expect to win Newark? Ukip will have \"a very good chance\", he says. Ukip amazed everyone in Eastleigh. If they do win, no one will be able to say Ukip are a one-man party. Here is some Twitter comment on the Nigel Farage's decision not to stand in Newark from journalists and commentators. Q: Why was Newark not suitable for Ukip? Farage says the best seats for Ukip are marginal ones, like Eastleigh. Q: Would this have damaged the European elections? Yes, says Farage. If he had stood in Newark, he would have \"kissed goodbye\" to the European election campaign. Ukip would not have been able to raise the issues it wants to raise. Q: And what does the local party think? Farage says he has spoken to them. They said they would support him if he wanted to stand. But, like him, they had concerns. They feared he would be seen as a London outsider. Q: But politics is about seizing the moment? Farage says he has only had 12 hours to think about it. Q: But what would you have to lose if you lost? Farage says it would have taken momentum away from Ukip. Q: David Cameron will be pleased by this, won't he? Farage says Cameron should not be relieved. Cameron does not know who Ukip's candidate would be. Ukip will pick a strong local candidate. Q: But you said beating the Tories would be a knock-out blow for Cameron. You said he would have to resign. Farage says Cameron may still have to resign. Q: Do you think you might live to regret this, like Michael Portillo regretting not standing against John Major? No, says Farage. He does not think he would regret it. Nigel Farage is now being interviewed on BBC News. He says that the Newark byelection could take place a week after the European elections. If he were to stand, Ukip would not be able to campaign on the issues, because people would focus on personality. He also says Ukip wants to settle its strategy for fighting seats in the 2015 election after the European election. He has no connections with the East Midlands, he says. He would look like a carpet-bagger. Here's what Nigel Farage told BBC News about why he would not be standing in Newark. It was only 12 hours ago that Patrick Mercer stood down so I haven’t had long to think about it, but I have thought about it and we’re just over three weeks away from a European election at which I think UKIP can cause an earthquake in British politics, from which we can go on and not just win one parliamentary seat but win quite a lot of parliamentary seats and for that reason I don’t want to do anything that deflects from the European election campaign so I’m not going to stand in this by-election. I want to focus the next three weeks on winning the European elections and also I don’t have any links with the east Midlands; I would just look like an opportunist and I don’t think that would work. I've taken the quote from PoliticsHome. I will post more quotes from his interviews shortly. Nick Robinson is now giving his post-interview analysis to Today. He says we should read Norman Smith's tweet. Smith, a BBC political correspondent, is in Bath, where Nigel Farage has been staying overnight in a hotel. And here they are. Robinson says the key point is Farage's admission that the Ukip bubble would \"burst\" if he stood and lost. Clarke says the government is running the place sensibly. We need a strong role in the world. The EU provides that. Q: Do you think people who support Ukip are racist? No, says Clarke. But he says Ukip does encourage bigotry and prejudice. What caused immigration was the boom, and the shortage of skills, he says. If you want to control immigration, you need another recession. In the modern world, you need immigration. There is no point sending French hedge fund managers home. This prejudice against immigration is \"dangerous nonsense\". He says he used to represent some of the villages now in the Newark constituency. They will not vote for a \"card\", he says. Kenneth Clarke says we are members of the EU. We need serious representation in Brussels. We have too many Ukip people there already, he says. Q: But people are voting Ukip because they have had enough of the conventional politics. Clarke says he has encountered that view. But in the real world there are serious issues to be tackled, and politicians need to tackle them. To vote for people who are protesting or have bizarre fringe views would put your livelihood at risk, he says. Your future depends on people taking politics seriously. The Nigel Farage interview is over. I will post full quotes soon. Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative minister and MP for Rushcliffe, next to Newark, is being interviewed now. He says Farage is not a fool. He knows Ukip could not win there. Ukip will have difficulty holding on to their MEP seats in the East Midlands, he says. Ukip are just a protest party, he says. Q: People cannot name any other members of Ukip. This will seem like an example of cowardice. Farage says it is about time Ukip finds other people. Let's find other people. Then none of you will be able to say it's a one-man party, he says. Q: You are ducking it. Farage says there is a much bigger prize than Newark. There is the general election. He wants to get many Ukip MPs elected, \"possibly even holding the balance of power\". Q: Your critics will say you are afraid of losing. Farage says he can be accused of many things, but \"being frit\" is not one of them. He is a fighter and a warrior, he says. But you have to pick your battles. He did not stand in Eastleigh, he says. But Ukip almost won there. Nigel Farage is on the Today programme now. He says if he stood in Newark, it would be a distraction from the European election campaign. And he has no real links with the area, he says. Nigel Farage has just announced he is not standing for Ukip in the Newark byelection. He will be on the Today programme shortly talking about it. Last night Farage said he was thinking \"very hard\" about standing in the byelection, caused by the resignation of Patrick Mercer. Here's the Guardian story about it. And here's how it starts. Nigel Farage is to give serious consideration to contesting the Newark byelection that was triggered after the former Conservative frontbencher Patrick Mercer resigned his seat. Mercer stepped down before the publication of a report that will call for his suspension from parliament for six months. The Ukip leader, who would strengthen his case to be included in the general election television debates if he were elected as an MP, said winning a parliamentary seat would burst the dam of British politics. \"We are very keen to get our first MP in Westminster, because once that happens, then the dam will have burst,\" he told ITV News. \"So I am going to think very hard about this over the next few days.\" But Farage, who declined to stand in the Eastleigh byelection last year despite standing in the seat nearly 20 years earlier, gave himself some leeway for the byelection, to be held after the European parliamentary elections on 22 May. The Ukip leader, who is all too aware that his party came a distant fourth in Newark in 2010 with 3.8% of the vote, told the BBC: \"What I've got to work out is, is it the right seat for me? My reservation in my mind is that I haven't particularly got connections with the local area.\" Farage will be hugely tempted to stand in the byelection that could take place after a Ukip victory in the European elections. Farage's presence at Westminster would act as a jolt to the Conservatives and would embolden eurosceptic rightwing Tories, who want David Cameron to harden his negotiating plans ahead of an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017. I will be focusing on this issue this morning, before turning to PMQs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jul/11/iran-nuclear-weapons-uranium-production","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Iran's nuclear threat is escalating | William Hague","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/11/iran-nuclear-weapons-uranium-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/11/iran-nuclear-weapons-uranium-production","fields":{"headline":"Iran's nuclear threat is escalating","bodyText":"On 8 June, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, announced plans to triple Iran's capacity to produce 20% enriched uranium, transferring enrichment from Natanz to the Fordo plant. Inside Iran this announcement by a discredited regime drew little comment and was quickly overshadowed by the domestic political theatre of the latest high-profile tussles between Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But it was an important statement because it makes even clearer the fact that Iran's programme is not designed for purely peaceful purposes. Iran has one civilian nuclear power station and is seeking to build more. All of these power stations need uranium enriched to about 3.5% for fuel. So plans to enrich any further rightly prompt questions. Uranium enriched to up to 20% does have some civilian uses. But not in the civilian nuclear power stations that Iran claims to desire. Predominantly it is used as fuel for research reactors, producing among other things isotopes for medical use. These are very efficient: one research reactor in Belgium is capable of producing almost all the medical isotopes needed across the whole of western Europe. Iran has one research reactor. The plans announced by Davani would provide more than four times its annual fuel requirements. Yet this reactor is already capable of producing enough radioisotopes for up to 1m medical investigations per year – already comparable to the UK and much more than Iran needs. The plan would also require diverting at least half of Iran's current annual output of 3.5% enriched uranium, and so deny it to Iran's nuclear power stations. If Iran is serious about developing civil nuclear energy, why divert limited materials and resources away from the civil energy programme in this way, while spurning offers of technological assistance for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy from the outside world, including the E3+3 countries of the UK, China, France, Germany, Russia and the US? Yet there is one clear purpose for this enriched uranium. Enrichment from natural uranium to 20% is the most time consuming and resource-intensive step in making the highly enriched uranium required for a nuclear weapon. And when enough 20% enriched uranium is accumulated at the underground facility at Qom, it would take only two or three months of additional work to convert this into weapons grade material. There would remain technical challenges to actually producing a bomb, but Iran would be a significant step closer. Iran's intensified uranium enrichment is envisaged to take place at a previously covert site, buried deep beneath the mountains. That it claims to allow International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring is not a safeguard. Iran has a persistent record of evasion and obfuscation with the IAEA. It has failed to provide the IAEA with access to relevant locations, equipment, persons or documents. It has not replied to questions from the IAEA on its procurement of nuclear-related items and aspects of its work that could be useful only for developing a nuclear weapon – such as multipoint detonation for the initiation of hemispherical explosive charges or, in plain English, detonators for an atom bomb. It has an active ballistic missile programme, including the development of missiles with a range of over a thousand kilometres, and carried out a range of missile tests in June. A reasonable observer cannot help but join the dots. This is not an abstract issue: Iran's nuclear programme could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, already the world's most volatile region. It would be both naive and a derogation of duty to give them – once again – the benefit of the doubt. This is why there are already six UN security council resolutions that require Iran to suspend enrichment immediately, all ignored by Iran. Iran has so far refused to enter into any negotiations on its nuclear programme until the E3+3 agrees to lift all sanctions and immediately recognise Iran's right to enrich. But there will remain no rationale for lifting sanctions until Iran engages in negotiations to address what are well-founded concerns about its nuclear programme. So far, Iran has done the opposite. This latest revelation demonstrates the urgency of increasing pressure. The UK is prepared to take action: I have already agreed a further 100 designations to add to EU sanctions in May, and last week announced additional travel bans against known proliferators. Iran may hope that the unprecedented changes of the Arab spring will distract the world from its nuclear programme. We are determined that it shall not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2012/jan/31/guardian-weekly-letters-3-february","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-31T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 3 February 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jan/31/guardian-weekly-letters-3-february","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/jan/31/guardian-weekly-letters-3-february","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 3 February 2012","bodyText":"Tali Sharot's article, Instinctively upbeat, assumes that the brain is \"wired\" or \"hard-wired\" to be optimistic (20 January). Sharot softens the \"wire\" metaphor to \"flow\" and \"connectivity\", but the idea that the brain is programmed persists. She is, however, in breach of her own argument when she states that \"people with mild depression ... see the world as it is\". How is this so if the brain is hard-wired to produce a distorting effect? The basic problem may lie in taking the wire metaphor too literally. Nobody believes they have wires in their head, but the metaphor may be responsible for a picture of the brain as made up of independently functioning centres that have to be connected. Another more complex model would be of the brain as a vast network of interacting cells that somehow – we don't yet know how – produces intelligence and consciousness. If this were so, the almost unlimited capacity of the human brain to innovate and solve problems should not surprise us. Gero Miesenböck, professor of physiology at Oxford, has said, \"We have no idea how the brain works\"; and although he sees the brain as \"nerve cells ... wired together\", he goes on to say \"we don't know where the switches are, and information processing, routing and storage all appear inseparably intertwined\". Until these sorts of issues are clarified, Sharot's hard-wire talk is a lot shakier than it appears. Raymond Pelly Wellington, New Zealand • The last paragraph of your article Instinctively upbeat brought to mind an old camel drivers' saying: \"Trust in Allah and tether your camel\". We definitely can take steps to determine our destiny and should. Brynn Mathews Cairns, Queensland, Australia US teachers under siege It doesn't seem like news to me that US schools have their own liaised police officers; in the eight schools over 27 years where I have sojourned, every one had a least one security officer (Don't talk back to teacher, 27 January). In inner cities especially it has always been and continues to be a blackboard jungle. For example, at my first school our four principals would themselves deal solely with classroom problems that involved potential crimes; otherwise, teachers were on their own with classroom discipline (this was in one of the very districts in Texas mentioned by the article). More recently (2004) I found myself blessed with a particular class of 15-year-olds, four of whom – all girls – had prior convictions for assault, one that of a teacher. I know this only because through the course of the year each made a point of confiding or boasting of her crimes in detail (teachers are not allowed access to criminal records of minors in their classes). And this was at a fairly good public school in Connecticut. At my last position we had CCTV for the halls and perimeter of the building, which the principal – a frail sexagenarian – monitored assiduously from her inner sanctum. Here, among other things, we suffered from a raft of prank fire alarms, especially during finals week – four in one day alone. Chris McGreal's cases in point are a reductio ad absurdum: I'd warrant that, if each were delved into more closely, we might find that it was the culmination of frustrated months of patient and positive corrective measures by the teacher. The dramatic increase in surveillance and adolescent criminalisation is the ultimate result of heightened civil litigation and financial awards in favour of parents, often over dubious grievances. Circumspection has been pushed to a siege-mentality: school districts now document every jot and tittle to cover their own asses and preserve their already imperilled budgets. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Nuclear power is a danger The Japanese government has finally admitted what was clear to many during the earliest days of the Fukushima nuclear crisis: that the disaster could have irradiated huge tracts of land including the greater Tokyo area, and required the evacuation of tens of millions of people. This worst-case scenario was only averted by good fortune and by the heroic sacrifice of Fukushima workers. It could still happen if further earthquakes destroy the temporary cooling systems at the plant or topple one of the spent fuel pools. One does not need to be an economist or sociologist to understand that such a development would cripple the country and cause unimaginable social upheaval. Indeed, former prime minister Naoto Kan admitted during an interview that as the crisis unfolded he \"was not sure whether Japan could continue to function as a state\". In view of these stark facts, do Guardian writers such as George Monbiot still see Fukushima as reason to stop worrying and love nuclear power? Martin Hawes Abels Bay, Tasmania, Australia Iran and the bomb Amid all the hype about Iran it must be noted that unlike several other countries in the region, Iran is signatory to the nuclear no-proliferation treaty and is in compliance with it (Leader, 20 January). The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons on the same grounds as the new Roman Catholic catechism: it is impossible to discriminate between military and civilian targets. Noam Chomsky writes in Hopes and Prospects: \"Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian observes that Iran seems to be the only case 'in international politics where a country has actually discussed the pros and cons of building a bomb' in public. He cites 'fairly conservative people from the military arguing against having the nuclear option', including a minister of defence.\" A number of western observers and commentators appear to adhere to a double standard. They condemn the \"hard line\" taken by the clerical dictatorship but choose to ignore the hardline position against nuclear weapons. Iran has also shown itself open to creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East. Iran is not a country that I should choose to live in. But it should also be noted that a war against Iran would have Iran's internal opposition solidly in support of the nation, against western aggression. Jordan Bishop Ottawa, Canada Lithium isn't the solution Regarding Dan Collyns's Grounded in the green energy race (13 January): regardless of agreeing or not with Bolivia's approach to exploiting its lithium, I was wondering if you understand that lithium is not an energy source or fuel, green or otherwise, and therefore cannot ever be the \"energy fuel of the future powering iPods, mobile phones, laptops and electric cars\". The claim makes me think back to Tony Blair talking about the hydrogen economy as if it would solve all our energy needs. Like hydrogen, lithium is only a carrier of energy. It might be a good one, allowing all sorts of new uses, but the energy itself will always have to be produced in some other way. Therefore, do not expect it to fulfil the world's energy addiction any more than hydrogen did. Sérgio Nogueira Brussels, Belgium A royal yacht? Capital! Shame on the government for not agreeing to finance a new royal yacht as a gift to the Queen (20 January). Surely a gift of this significance would delight the unemployed Liverpudlians you referred to on the facing page. If they are disgusted by these crude inequalities, they can do what I reluctantly had to do and abandon the country of my birth: emigrate to a land with more equalities built into the system and leave the UK to its House of Lords and privileged establishment. On the other hand the yacht fiasco could rouse enough indignation to force the abdication of the monarchy and bring about a more egalitarian society – long overdue – and royal withdrawal would avoid the alternative French solution to ridding the country of its parasitic royals. Ronald Craig Smith Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada Briefly • I'm not sure what exactly the statement that our species' end is \"statistically likely to happen in the next 800,000 years\" means (20 January). But the fact that our species has so far survived for about 200,000 years actually reduces the likelihood of extinction occurring before the mammalian average of around a million years and increases the chances of it occurring after that. Malcolm Faddy Maleny, Queensland, Australia • I read, with interest, Franziska Hackhasen's comments about your article regarding gays in the US military (20 January).

The loan was among investments announced by ministers as the government named 119 successful bidders for the second round of the £1.4bn regional growth fund. The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has been the target of intense criticism in Sheffield over the original loan cancellation. The money will be used to purchase machinery and equipment to expand the business, the steel firm said. Clegg denied the policy represented a U-turn, saying: \"Last year we came into Government and the outgoing Labour government wrote a little note – the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – saying there is no money.\" The original £80m loan had been intended to build large parts for nuclear power stations. The Liberal Democrat leader said: \"For every £1 that will be invested from the regional growth fund, we estimate £6 will be matched from the private sector.\" It emerged that one reason for the slow progress towards handing out cash for the first round bids was because companies have to hire and pay for private consultants to undertake due dilligence on their bids. Previously, the government's regional development agencies, now abolished, undertook due diligence at taxpayers' expense. In a written statement, business secretary Vince Cable said there had been 492 bids for £3.3bn funding. A panel chaired by Lord Heseltine helped decide on the 119 successful bids for the £950m available. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, accused the prime minister of being \"out of touch\" and said the government was failing to address a lack of economic growth. He said the \"long-delayed funding\" represented a two-thirds cut, with one year's budget of the scrapped regional development agencies being paid out over three years. \"Power stations already in the pipeline are finally being given the green light, but no investment is actually being brought forward,\" he said. • This article was amended on 1 November 2011 to remove the reference to Sheffield Forgemasters being in Nick Clegg's Sheffield Hallam constituency.

We would expect investment in renewables, especially solar, to increase. Nuclear has become politically unacceptable,\" she said. Rupesh Madlani, a renewables analyst at Barclays Capital in London agreed. \"At the very least, we would expect significant investments in nuclear power to be delayed, or deferred, for one to two years.\" But some leading environmentalists who have backed the technology as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels said the accident should not slow new nuclear investment. The climate scientist James Lovelock said the problems in Japan should not put people off nuclear power. \"There is a monstrous myth about nuclear power. I would make a strong guess that of the tens of thousands of people killed in Japan, none of them will be from nuclear power.\" He said that people were \"prejudiced\" against nuclear power unreasonably. \"It is very safe,\" he said. Chernobyl, for instance, was \"an idiotic mess-up that could only have occurred in the Soviet Union\", and according to UN estimates had killed only about 56 people. More people are routinely killed in oil refineries and coal mines, he pointed out. He added that the reactors affected in Japan were among the oldest still operating, and that newer plants had more safety features. Mark Lynas, another environmental campaigner who has espoused nuclear power as a way to limit climate change, was also strongly supportive of the technology, but pessimistic about how it would be perceived after the Japanese experience. \"It's too early to make a final diagnosis of what is happening in Japan, but what is obvious is that this will be a colossal setback for the nuclear industry at just the moment at which climate change is sparking a real renaissance,\" he said. While he said there was unlikely to be serious damage resulting from the problems at nuclear power stations in Japan, he said the public perception of events was likely to taint the reputation of nuclear power. He said the events in Japan were \"extremely bad\" for nuclear energy, even though Japan had little opportunity to generate more energy from renewable sources, because of a lack of land for wind power and a lack of sun to generate solar energy. \"It's about public acceptability,\" he said. \"If people do not think nuclear power is acceptable, then the most likely outcome is a return to fossil fuels.\" But Benny Peiser, director of climate sceptic group Global Warming Policy Foundation, doubted that the accident would benefit renewables. \"Japan's nuclear disaster will only intensify the global race for cheap fossil fuels while most future energy research and development will go into nuclear safety,\" he said. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said the Japanese accident strengthened the case against new nuclear construction. \"You will never be able to completely design out human error, design failure or natural disaster,\" said Lucas, whose party backs energy efficiency and more renewable energy to meet Britain's energy and climate change goals. Walt Patterson, associate fellow at Chatham House thinktank, said that the financial damage could also be severe. \"Somebody is going to wind up paying the bill and it will probably be the Japanese public one way or another,\" he said. \"That is undoubtedly going to filter back to the debate in Europe as a further factor in the very dubious economics of these plants,\" he told Reuters. European governments yesterday scrambled to step up efforts to assess nuclear safety. Germany is to take seven of its 17 nuclear reactors offline for three months while the country reconsiders plans to extend the life of its atomic power plants. Switzerland has said that it will impose a moratorium on three new plants and Finland will review the safety of its nuclear reactors. On Tuesday, a meeting of EU energy ministers, nuclear regulators and industry officials agreed in principle to a series of \"stress tests\" for European nuclear power stations. \"I think it will make a lot of governments, authorities and other planners think twice about planning power stations in seismic areas,\" said Jan Haverkamp, European Union policy campaigner for environmental group Greenpeace, which opposes new nuclear reactors and wants existing ones phased out. Other analysts said they expected confidence in nuclear power to drop significantly as it did in the aftermath of other major accidents. Political confidence took at least three years to recover after the partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the accident slowed growth, but led to a large number of new safety measures. But any renewed confidence was shattered six years later in April 1986 after the Chernobyl accident – the most devastating in the history of nuclear power. World leaders categorically declared their continued intention to rely on the source of energy within weeks of the catastrophe, but funding for nuclear energy research dried up, the public became hostile and financiers in the US and Europe shunned the industry. No new reactors were ordered in the US for 25 years while Germany, Italy and many other European countries banned the expansion of the energy source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/22/energy-bill-nuclear-gas-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Energy bill expected to favour nuclear and gas over renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/22/energy-bill-nuclear-gas-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/22/energy-bill-nuclear-gas-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill expected to favour nuclear and gas over renewables","bodyText":"A dash for gas, a major fillip for nuclear power and blows to renewable energy – these are widely expected to be the contents of the government's much-anticipated draft energy bill, the main contents of which will be outlined by ministers in the afternoon. The nuclear industry is expected to be one of the big winners, with a set of policies designed to favour low-carbon power – which will, controversially, include atomic energy as well as renewable sources such as wind and solar. But renewable companies are concerned that they will lose out, because the current system of subsidies will be replaced with a complex new system of support that could favour big companies over their smaller rivals. This new system – known as contracts for difference – would allow companies to sign long-term contracts to supply electricity. But the prices on such contracts could be higher or lower than the price of electricity in the wholesale market – the attraction to companies is supposed to be that the long-term nature of the contracts gives them the stability and certainty they need to invest. However, several renewables companies told the Guardian they thought the contracts would push smaller suppliers out of the market. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, called for an exemption for small suppliers in order to encourage competition in the market. \"This is a complex subsidy mechanism designed to artificially raise the price of electricity and make it more attractive for big companies to build new nuclear plants, but as a result no suppliers will be able to accurately predict the cost or volume of electricity that must be budgeted for at the start of each year,\" he said. \"The level of risk in getting that prediction wrong will be a big problem for the big six energy companies, so imagine how much the risk is magnified for small energy suppliers. This risk does not exist under the current support mechanism for renewables.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change said its research showed the contracts for difference would provide good value for money for consumers. Gas will also be a major focus of the new policy. It is seen as a relatively easy option to \"keep the lights on\" as many of the UK's ageing coal-fired power stations and nuclear reactors are due to be taken out of service by 2020. Renewable energy, such as offshore wind, is not being built fast enough to close the potential \"energy gap\" between supply and demand. Gas-fired power stations, by contrast, can be built very quickly – within less than two years on average – and relatively cheaply, so if there is a threat of energy shortages they can be a stopgap, and they produce less carbon than coal. A new \"dash for gas\", however, would be fatal to the hopes of building a low-carbon economy in the UK, according to green campaigners, and could leave consumers hooked on an increasingly expensive fossil fuel, with the soaring price rises that could entail. The UK's own supplies of natural gas in the North Sea are being rapidly depleted, making consumers heavily dependent on imports and the price volatility that brings. As any new gas-fired power stations would be expected to carry on operating – and producing CO2 – for at least 25 years, this would also make the UK's climate change targets in the 2020s increasingly hard to meet. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \"This is a looming energy omnishambles. The energy bill could be a huge opportunity to get energy bills and carbon emissions under control, and to bring security to our power supplies. But ministers seem hell-bent on scuppering all of these aims by encouraging a big increase in our dependence on burning expensive gas to generate electricity. \"This would increase the burden on families and businesses, and see money from bills going to countries like Qatar and Norway instead of back into the British economy.\" Much of the content of the new policy has already been discussed, but there could still be surprises in the form of some of the details, which have still to be set out, and in the timing. Two years into the coalition, the government has come under fire for failing to tackle energy issues sooner – and any further delays will be greeted with dismay by sections of the industry and investors who have repeatedly said that policy certainty is essential if the hundreds of billions in investment needed to revamp the UK's creaking energy infrastructure are to be flow. Renewable energy companies believe there is still time for the government to show them more support in its energy plans. Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"The government needs to enrich its understanding of the benefits of renewable energy investment. There is frustration that government leadership is missing in practice … Several countries, from America to Japan to Germany, have realised that taking the long-term view and investing in renewables is a significant step on the route out of economic malaise.\" Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said the reforms were needed in order to bring forward the estimated £110bn that will be needed for new low-carbon energy capacity, and said they could generate as many as 250,000 new jobs. He said: \"Leaving the electricity market as it is would not be in the national interest. If we don't secure investment in our energy infrastructure, we could see the lights going out, consumers hit by spiralling energy prices and dangerous climate change. These reforms will ensure we can keep the lights on, bills down and the air clean.\" Davey said the reforms would reduce the UK's vulnerability to rising global energy prices: \"By reforming the market, we can ensure security of supply for the long term, reduce the volatility of energy bills by reducing our reliance on imported gas and oil, and meet our climate change goals by largely decarbonising the power sector during the 2030s.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/13/military-trial-alleged-9-11-terrorists","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-13T10:33:43Z","webTitle":"A military trial for alleged 9/11 terrorists is unlikely to lead to justice | Nick Fielding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/13/military-trial-alleged-9-11-terrorists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/13/military-trial-alleged-9-11-terrorists","fields":{"headline":"A military trial for alleged 9/11 terrorists is unlikely to lead to justice","bodyText":"After almost 10 years of incarceration, US officials have announced that five of the most important prisoners left in Guantánamo Bay are finally to go on trial in a capital military tribunal where, if found guilty, they are likely to be executed. By far the most important prisoner is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – known as KSM – who together with his co-accused Ramzi bin al-Shibh, is widely recognised as the mastermind behind the planning of the 9/11 attacks on America. The others are KSM's nephew Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. All five men were arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003. The military tribunal is the latest development in an extraordinarily convoluted and distorted legal saga that has already damaged the prospects of a fair trial for any of the accused. All of these men have been held in secret CIA \"black sites\" around the world, for months or years on end. KSM, who was captured in March 2003 at the home of a Pakistani military officer in the heart of a military camp in Rawalpindi, was waterboarded 183 times during the almost three-and-a-half years he spent in this maze of secret prisons. Waterboarding is an extreme form of torture which, although it leaves no physical marks, makes the victim believe he is about to drown. Only in September 2006 did KSM arrive at Guantánamo Bay. Not surprisingly, he revealed a wealth of information about the way in which the 9/11 attacks were organised, as well as his role in numerous other attacks and plots. In fact, as he first told the Red Cross in October 2006, he provided the information that his interrogators wanted to hear in order to stop the torture. At his first combatant status review tribunal in 2007 he admitted to an extraordinary catalogue of terrorist attacks, many of which he was responsible for, others merely vague ideas. Those admissions included responsibility for the 9/11 operation \"from A to Z\", the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing, the decapitation of journalist Daniel Pearl, recruiting shoe bomber Richard Reid, the Bali nightclub bombing, a plot to bomb and destroy the Panama Canal, plans to assassinate former US president Jimmy Carter, Pope John Paul II, Bill Clinton and Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, plots to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge, the Sears Tower in Chicago, Heathrow airport, Big Ben, the New York Stock Exchange, various nuclear power plants, Nato headquarters in Brussels and numerous other targets, both real and imagined. It was one of the most comprehensive confessions of all time. In February 2008 the US Department of Defence announced that charges had been sworn against six detainees at Guantánamo – the same group who were charged a few days ago, plus an Arab who had been sent to join the 9/11 hijackers, but who had been refused entry to the US. The military trial actually began in June 2008, witnessed by 35 journalists in an adjoining room who heard KSM decline legal representation for what was looking increasingly like a show trial. The proceedings dragged on until December 2008 when, in an unexpected move, all the accused told the military judge they wished to plead guilty. Three months later they issued a response to the nine-main charges against them, dismissing most of the allegations and attempting to justify their actions. They all signed the document as the \"9/11 Shura Council\". Soon after, the military trial was abandoned. As these chaotic bureaucratic and legal bungles further undermined any prospect of a fair trial, KSM took the opportunity to refresh his image. He now sought to portray himself as a martyr to justice. Despite his incarceration in Guantánamo, two new photos of him have appeared, released to his family by the Red Cross. Instead of the image of the scruffy-looking man in white pyjamas taken when he was being arrested, the new images show a smiling man with a great bushy beard, looking more like a guru than a mass murderer. KSM, it seemed, was flourishing. The next event was yet another disaster for American justice. In November 2009, following pressure from the new Obama administration, it was announced that all five men would be transferred to a prison in New York to be tried in a civilian court. At last it looked as if justice would prevail. But it was not to be. Despite the efforts of the new president, a majority of members of the US Congress were determined that none of the Guantánamo prisoners should have a civil trial on American soil. In January 2011, in a humiliating act, President Obama was forced to sign the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA), prohibiting the use of government funds to transfer detainees from Guantánamo to the US mainland. In April last year, a clearly angry US attorney general, Eric Holder , finally announced that once again, the men were to be tried by a military commission at Guantánamo. Now that trial is about to start. After claims of torture, rendition, confession, aborted military commission and civilian trial, can anyone expect that justice will be served? • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/14/how-conservatives-can-fight-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-14T13:15:44Z","webTitle":"How conservatives can help to tackle climate change  | Roger Scruton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/14/how-conservatives-can-fight-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/14/how-conservatives-can-fight-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"How conservatives can help to tackle climate change","bodyText":"Environmental degradation has one cause above all others: the propensity of human beings to take the benefit and leave the costs to someone else, preferably someone far away in space or time, whose protests can be safely ignored. The solution is to give space to the rival tendency in human nature, which is to take charge of costs, when the costs affect one's home. So my book Green Philosophy is an exploration of the motive I call \"oikophilia\", the love of home. The propensity for settlement and stewardship is at the heart of conservative philosophy, I argue, and ought to be at the heart of Conservative politics, too. But what about climate change? This question is the first I am asked by all those on the left to whom I try to explain my views, and it is a fair question. Here is a problem that cannot be solved by local action. There is nothing I and my neighbours, or even I and my nation, can do to rectify a problem that affects the entire earth and can never be cured in some local part of it. Surely, therefore, there is no solution other than a radical change of lifestyle, imposed by international treaty and enforced across the globe? As soon as you put it that way, however, the doubts arise. Politicians in democracies don't sign treaties that will commit their voters to unacceptable changes in their way of life. What is the point of signing a treaty if you lose the election that would enable you to enforce it? Politicians in autocratic states sign treaties willy-nilly, but only because nobody is in a position to hold them to the deal. If globetrotting in search of a climate-change treaty is what environmental politics amounts to, then we can be forgiven for thinking it is nothing more than conscience-washing by the political class. There is a tendency on the libertarian right to dismiss the entire environmental agenda, and to give credence to those scientists who argue either that global warming is a myth, or that it is not caused by human action and therefore not curable by human action. I don't go along with that – although, like most people who consider these questions, I am a mere amateur when it comes to the science. It stands to reason that the Earth will get warmer if the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is constantly rising. So how do we change? To penalise the use of fossil fuels when these are the principal – or the only – source of energy is impossible. People will not accept using less energy than they need; and in any case, large-scale political initiatives always need more energy, not less. There are two solutions: to find a source of clean energy that can be made freely available around the globe, or to embark on some work of geoengineering that will counter the effect of carbon emissions. The second of those is so controversial that no politician will touch it. But the first has given rise to a spate of unreal and environmentally damaging solutions, such as the craze for windfarms, whose largely symbolic contribution to the grid is more than offset by the damage that they inflict on our shared sense of stewardship. Why care for the environment, if the price of doing so is the loss of an environment that you could care for? Besides, windfarms always need that other, more reliable, and more polluting source of energy, which comes, in the German case, by plugging in to the French nuclear-powered grid. The depths of hypocrisy here need no comment. The French are surely right to rely on nuclear power. There are risks, but the management of risk is what the environmental question is all about. Meanwhile, we should face the facts: the problem of clean energy is first and foremost a scientific problem. It will be solved by well-funded scientists working in an atmosphere of free enquiry. In other words, it will emerge in a wealthy and democratic nation state, and can only be hampered by devoting our resources to futile treaty-mongering. Like every other viable environmental policy, the search for clean energy begins at home. • Roger Scruton is a philosopher and the author of Green Philosophy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2011/dec/04/cinderella-hackney-empire-london-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-04T16:09:34Z","webTitle":"Cinderella – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/04/cinderella-hackney-empire-london-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2011/dec/04/cinderella-hackney-empire-london-review","fields":{"headline":"Cinderella – review","bodyText":"There's a crisis in pantoland. The East End's best-loved dame, Clive Rowe, has defected to the West End and The Ladykillers, leaving Hackney without its main draw. Can anyone even begin to fill his ample drawers? Can the show survive the loss of a performer who lights up the stage like a nuclear power reactor? Fortunately, panto supremo, writer and director, Susie McKenna, is on hand to sprinkle a little fairy dust and ensure that we will all go to the ball after all. In the circumstances Cinderella is a smart choice, offering no main dame but two exceptionally ugly sisters, Queeniqua and Victiqua, played with verve and delightful bad taste by Tony Whittle and Kat B. They don't so much turn heads in their finery, as stomachs. The fascinators they sport for the palace ball have obviously been inspired by the Royal wedding headgear of Princess Beatrice. \"The very episiotomy of sophistication,\" as their proud mum puts it. Better still, the early demise of Lend Me a Tenor in the West End has been the East End's considerable gain, with Tenor refugees Sophie-Louise Dann's Fairy God Mother and Joanna Riding's Wicked Stepmother both adding a touch of class and belting out the numbers with real finesse. Riding's wickedly slinky Anastia (motto: \"Because I'm worth it\"), who aims to get her hands on Hackney-on-Lee's Hardup Hall, demolish it and turn the resulting space into a car park for the Olympics, is such excellent value you start to wish that evil will triumph. Think Lady Gaga with added menace. Riding is matched in the singing stakes by veteran Peter Straker's Baron Hardup. In fact this is an exceptionally well-sung panto all round, with some right royal theatrical surprises: Clarke Peters and Sharon D Clark give voice to the puppet mice, Duke and Duchess. It may not have the driving energy (particularly in the second half) to be quite \"top banana\" as Matt Dempsey's loveable Buttons would have it, but it's certainly got spirit – like its heroine Cinders (Sophia Ragavelas) who on her first meeting with the Prince Charming (Wayne Perry) tells him to \"get a life, posh boy.\" It's also got some terrific glittery designs by Lotte Collett that put the sparkle into the fairy tale and which provide a stunning transformation scene in which clapped out old panto horse, Clapton, is transformed into a flying 3D winged Pegasus pulling Cinders towards her date with destiny. Gaudy, cheerful and occasionally joyous, it's a show that hits the panto spot and plugs the gap. Maybe by next year, Clive Rowe will once again be dame for a laugh. Until 8 January.

What little information emerges from the world's most secretive state is almost too disturbing to process. A communist monarchy and impoverished nuclear power that relies upon slave labour and levels of repression that even George Orwell would have struggled to invent: it's as if Nineteen Eighty-Four was taken not as a critique but a blueprint. But for North Koreans, like abused children, the grim reality of the Kim family dynasty is all they know. Until recently, full accounts of life in this famine-riven dystopia were hard to come by. Then a couple of years ago, Barbara Demick's Nothing to Envy provided excoriating testimonies of refugees who had managed to escape into China and then on to South Korea. The picture those witnesses drew of North Korea was of one vast and brutal gulag. Now comes Escape From Camp 14, a still more harrowing account of the gulag within the gulag, the huge prison camps that litter the more remote provinces of this benighted country. Written by Blaine Harden, an experienced American journalist, it tells the extraordinary story of Shin Dong-hyuk, the only person born in the gulag to have escaped. As with the terrors of Stalin and Mao, North Korea judges any crimes against the state as blood crimes. So when Shin's uncle committed the capital crime of escaping from the state, his remaining family were imprisoned for life. Although cohabiting is not allowed in the prison camp, Shin was the result of his parents being granted one of the rare conjugal permits. He spent his childhood in unforgiving and unpaid labour, developing the survival skills – snitching and stealing – that were vital for a daily existence, constantly threatened by beating and starvation. At 13, when he learned that his mother and brother were planning to escape, he did what had become instinctive and betrayed them to the authorities. The pair were tortured before his mother was hanged and his brother shot. But Shin, too, was tortured, for weeks in an underground prison within the prison camp, within the prison state. He had upset one guard by giving his information on his mother's plot to another guard, rather than to him. The narrative, I should warn sensitive readers, is unyielding in its pain and despair. Except that Shin didn't despair, because despair requires hope and he possessed no hope. He could see no further than his next meal, which was often difficult enough to find. It was only meeting an older prisoner, a disgraced party official who had travelled abroad, that led him to start thinking of a world beyond the electric fence and beyond North Korea. The two planned an escape that only Shin, with no small luck, survived. Eventually, after sneaking across the Chinese border and finding paid work for the first time in his life, he made his way to South Korea – not a straightforward journey because China, ever indifferent to human rights, sends asylum seekers back to North Korea. Once in the south, like the majority of North Korean refugees, Shin struggled to settle. The South Korean state offers generous provisions for refugees, but the South Koreans themselves tend to view their northern neighbours as problem cases. For Shin's part, having been guided from birth by nothing more complex than a desire to assuage pain and hunger, he remained unmotivated by South Korea's preoccupation with profit and competition. He drifted around aimlessly for a while and then moved to the US, where, despite the support of refugee groups, he has also failed to find a position or place that he can nurture. The sense of chronic, and perhaps incurable, displacement is just one of the legacies of his appalling treatment in North Korea. Survivors of the Nazi concentration camps also suffered long after their release, but at least they had group solidarity and a distinct place in history. No such consolations are afforded North Korean survivors. First, they were practically bred to be pitted against one another, and second, as Harden notes: \"While Auschwitz existed for only three years, Camp 14 is a 50-year-old Skinner box\" – referring to BF Skinner's notorious behavioural experiments. To some, perhaps many, this might appear to be a book that has few redemptive qualities. After all, what can be done with this knowledge of suffering? But it's important to recognise the depth of misery in North Korea, not just to be aware of the horror of the Kim regime, but also to stand as a testament to the plight of a terrorised people. One other reason is to arm yourself against those misguided individuals who continue to see in North Korea an anti-imperialist challenge to the US. They may be rare, but they're not always without influence. One example is Andrew Murray, who, as an executive member of the Communist party of Britain, expressed his party's \"solidarity\" with Kim Jong-il's \"People's Korea\". Murray now sits on the TUC general council and was until recently chair of the Stop the War coalition. Unfortunately, North Korea's war on its own people shows no sign of stopping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2012/mar/06/brazil-economy-worlds-sixth-largest","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-06T16:51:39Z","webTitle":"Brazil's economy overtakes UK to become world's sixth largest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/06/brazil-economy-worlds-sixth-largest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/mar/06/brazil-economy-worlds-sixth-largest","fields":{"headline":"Brazil's economy overtakes UK to become world's sixth largest","bodyText":"Brazil has claimed the UK's spot as the world's sixth largest economy after official figures showed its economy rose 2.7% last year against the UK's 0.8%. France remains in fifth place behind Germany, Japan, China and the US. The per capita income of Brazilians remains less than a third of that enjoyed in the UK at $11,000 (£7,000) per head, but the situation is improving all the time while western economies largely stagnate. The economic thinktank, the CEBR, predicted last year that Brazil would climb above the UK in 2012 and would itself be leapfrogged by India and Russia by 2020. Tim Ohlenburg, of the CEBR, said the high value of Brazil's currency was a big factor in the country's burgeoning wealth. \"It is a bigger economy when measured at current market exchange rates,\" he said. Brazil's dash for growth can be traced back to the mid 1990s when a string of privatisations ended the state's dominance of commercial life. China became a big customer, with a particular liking for soya beans and iron ore. The US also began to invest heavily in the country. Top of the list of economic attractions is agriculture and the processing of foodstuffs, which account for about a quarter of Brazilian GDP and 36% of exports. In the last 20 years it has become the world's largest producer of sugarcane, coffee, tropical fruits, and has the world's largest commercial cattle herd (50% larger than that of the US) at 170m animals, according to official figures. Oil is expected to become the next big commodity for export, especially if a way can be found to drill safely in the Atlantic's deep waters. Reserves are believed to equal those shared by Norway and the UK in the North Sea. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva brought in social policies to raise the incomes of Brazil's poorest after his election in 2002. Dilma Rousseff, his handpicked Workers' party successor, oversees a country where most people are considered middle class. Rousseff is considered a strong advocate for transparency in government, which is code for tackling corruption. Within the first year of her government, several cabinet ministers resigned after accusations of graft in awarding contracts. Yet bribery and the politicisation of the civil service continue to cause problems, with many overseas companies complaining that contracts are only signed and completed after dollars have greased many palms. Lula gave workers the right to sit on pension boards as a way for the low paid to exercise control over the country's growing commercial and industrial businesses. But the project has failed to realise much in the way of action and despite further labour protections, a small group of wealthy families own most of Brazil's major banks and companies. Still, the combination of huge natural resources and significant growth in manufacturing and services has meant Brazil is one of the most attractive places for the world's super rich, and that includes corporations, to park their money. One of the knock-on effects has been to push up the value of the real, which has appreciated 40% since the financial crisis of 2008. For Brazil's wealthy it is a boon because it increases their wealth and foreign buying power. It has also allowed the government to embark on a spending spree. But for exporters it is a huge headache. The long-serving finance minister, Guido Mantega, has railed against the rising value of the currency, which he knows pushes up the price of exports and could put whole industries out of business. Should the commodity boom end, the high value of the real could mean the country has little in the way of business to fall back on. Mantega blames the US, UK and continental Europe for driving investors towards Brazil. He argues that quantitative easing schemes have cheapened the world's major currencies, leaving his as one of the few attractive ones around. However, he is trapped because domestic savings are not sufficient to sustain long-term high growth rates. That means Brazil must continue to attract foreign investment, especially as the government plans to cover the cost of oil extraction, nuclear power, and other infrastructure sectors over the next few years. • This article was amended on 8 March 2012. The original sub-heading said that figures show Brazilian economy rose 2.7% last year compared with the UK's 0.8% – but per capita income remains a third less. This has been corrected. In addition, the text stated that President Lula was elected in 2001. This has also been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/15/rod-to-beat-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Letters: Another rod to beat the nuclear industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/15/rod-to-beat-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/15/rod-to-beat-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"Another rod to beat the nuclear industry","bodyText":"It's hardly a surprise that building nuclear power stations on seismic fault lines, as Japan has done, turns out to be a foolish thing. The Fukushima disaster may mean meltdown or worse, but what it will certainly mean is extra expense (Disaster in Japan, 14 March). Nuclear has always been an expensive white elephant. UK taxpayers subsidise nuclear to the tune of £1bn a year. Half the civil servants at the Department of Energy work on nuclear power, which makes a mockery of energy secretary Chris Huhne's claim that no public money will be spent on new nuclear. A report by the US Union of Concerned Scientists last month said nuclear power in the US had never operated without public subsidies. The cost of decommissioning old nuclear in the UK is estimated to be at least £73bn. Surely, therefore, anyone wishing to provide new nuclear should have to put that sort of sum into an upfront clean-up fund. But of course they can't possibly afford to. Nuclear power is uninsurable. It's too risky and the potential payouts are too big. The taxpayer will have to pay, as we did to bail out the banks. Only two nuclear power stations are under construction in western Europe: one in France and one in Finland. The Finnish reactor – supposed to be the first of a new generation of safe and affordable units – is being subsidised by the French nuclear industry as a loss leader in the hope that it will spark a new nuclear building boom. The project has been plagued with cost overruns and delays, is under investigation by the Finnish nuclear safety regulator and is probably the single best reason why new nuclear is a mistake.

The risk that used fuel rods present to efforts to avert disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant was underlined on Tuesday when nuclear safety officials said the No 2 reactor's storage pool had heated to around boiling point, raising the risk of a leakage of radioactive steam. \"We cannot leave this alone and we must take care of it as quickly as possible,\" Hidehiko Nishiyama, of the nuclear and industrial safety agency, said. According to documents from Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company repeatedly missed safety checks over a 10-year period up to two weeks before the 11 March disaster, and allowed uranium fuel rods to pile up inside the 40-year-old facility. When the plant was struck by a huge earthquake and tsunami, its reactors, designed by US scientists 50 years ago, contained the equivalent of almost six years of highly radioactive uranium fuel produced by the facility, according to a presentation Tepco gave to the International Atomic Energy Agency and later posted on the company's website. The revelations will add to pressure on Tepco to explain why, under its cost-cutting chief executive Masataka Shimizu, it opted to save money by storing the spent fuel on site rather than invest in safer storage options. The firm already faces scrutiny over why it waited so long to pump seawater into the stricken reactors and, according to a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper last week, turned down US offers of help to cool the reactors shortly after the disaster. Critics of Japan's nuclear power programme say the industry's patchy safety record and close ties to regulating authorities will have to change if it is to regain public trust. \"I've long thought the whole system is a mess,\" Taro Kono, a Liberal Democratic party MP, told Reuters. \"We have to go through our whole nuclear strategy after this. \"Now, no one is going to accept nuclear waste in their backyards. You can have an earthquake and have radioactive material under your house. We're going to have a real debate on this.\" Kono wants to see the government lead a fundamental reform of the industry's structure, which he says has encouraged collusion between plant operators and the people who are supposed to regulate them. Reports said safety lapses at the plant continued up to two weeks before the tsunami disabled cooling systems in its reactors and sparked the biggest nuclear power emergency the world has seen since Chernobyl in 1986. One month before the tsunami, government regulators approved a Tepco request to prolong the life of one of its six reactors by another decade, despite warnings that its backup power generator contained stress cracks, making them more vulnerable to water damage. Weeks later, Tepco admitted it had failed to inspect 33 pieces of equipment inside the plant's cooling systems, including water pumps, according to the nuclear safety agency's website. Regulators have been accused of uncritically backing industry moves to prolong the life of ageing nuclear power plants such as Fukushima Daiichi amid mounting local opposition to the construction of new facilities. A regulatory committee reviewing the reactor's stay of execution said maintenance management was \"inadequate\", and the quality of inspection \"insufficient,\" according to reports. When disaster struck earlier this month, the plant contained almost 4,000 uranium fuel assemblies kept in pools of circulating water – the equivalent of more than three times the amount of radioactive material usually kept in the active cores of the plant's reactors. The drop-in water levels in some of those pools after the tsunami has caused fuel rods to overheat, raising the risk of a full meltdown and the release of dangerous levels of radioactivity into the atmosphere. Tepco workers, troops and firefighters have been working around the clock to keep the storage pools replenished by dumping water from helicopters and via high-pressure hoses from the ground. The No 4 reactor, which suffered two explosions last week, contained 548 fuel assemblies cooling in a water pool on its upper floor. Japanese plans to store radioactive nuclear fuel after it has been used have made little headway. A medium-term storage site in Mutsu, northern Japan, is not due to open until next year, and the construction of an enrichment and reprocessing plant in Rokkasho has been hit by technical glitches and other delays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2012/jan/23/week-ahead-230112-270112","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-23T16:05:00Z","webTitle":"The week ahead: 23/01/12-27/01/12","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jan/23/week-ahead-230112-270112","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jan/23/week-ahead-230112-270112","fields":{"headline":"The week ahead: 23/01/12-27/01/12","bodyText":"Today (Monday 23 January) the public accounts committee (PAC) takes evidence on Ministry of Justice financial management.

They have overcome the legacies of nazism and communism to build a model republican democracy. They have nurtured the Victorian virtues the British have thrown away – thrift, industriousness and civility. But unlike the British at the height of their Victorian arrogance, modern Germans display nothing but guilt about their past. At a rational level, German guilt is absurd – there is hardly a German left alive responsible for the crimes of nazism, and the ranks of the communist old guard are emptying by the year. But it remains impressive. What other nation would turn five acres of valuable land in the centre of its capital into a vast, grim memorial to Jews it murdered?. Germany's contrition counts for nothing. Let distress fall across the continent, and Germanophobia rises again. In Athens, street theatre companies entertain protesters with poisonous vignettes of German soldiers threatening Greek women and children. Even British supporters of the euro now worry about Frau Merkel replacing elected prime ministers in Greece and Italy with a snap of her fingers. Denunciations of a \"Fourth Reich\" are everywhere but miss the real danger. Germany is threatening Europe again. But it is not German militarism and nationalism that menaces – those demons are dead – but German irresponsibility and sanctimony. Hegel's \"cunning of history\" is playing its tricks in the land of his birth. Selfless guilt about the crimes of the 20th century can, it turns out, provide a perfect cover for selfishness in the 21st. Germany displayed the usefulness of guilt when it refused to help its Nato allies overthrow the Gaddafi regime. Germany had experienced the worst the totalitarianisms of the past had to offer, but felt no sympathy for the victims of modern dictators. Libyans would shed their blood, France, Italy and Britain would spend their treasure, but Germans would stay at home and hoard their reserves of both. Far from feeling shame about their lack of solidarity, German politicians used anti-fascist arguments to justify keeping Libyans subjugated. There were the usual hints that because of its history it was dangerous to allow German soldiers ever to fire a shot in anger for fear it might give them ideas. Birgit Homburger from Merkel's ruling coalition added that foreigners had no right to criticise Germany when they were \"going it alone themselves\". It was a resonant phrase. Going it alone, declaring war unilaterally, was what Germany did to Czechoslovakia and Poland when it was under the control of… you know who. The humbug that surrounded Germany's decision to close nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster surpassed even the Libyan fiasco. Merkel dressed it up in the language of green rectitude – and forgot that those who are sincere in their desire to limit global warming welcome nuclear power as the best alternative to fossil fuels. Her officials then let slip that Germany would continue to buy energy generated from French nuclear stations. Germans would have it all ways: enjoy the benefits of nuclear power while avoiding the risks. But it has been the euro crisis that has cemented Germans into the stock caricature of the bourgeois hypocrites, who mouth pious platitudes while lining their own pockets. The euro has been a wonderful boon for Germany. It has held down its exchange rate and allowed its exporters to trade at a crushing advantage. Germany's current account surplus last year was 6% of GDP. Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal cannot try to claw back ground by devaluing because they are trapped in the eurozone. It is as if they are living in the same state as the Germans. But the eurozone is not a \"superstate\" or any kind of state – despite what you read in the Tory press. Germans are thus freed from the onerous obligation of having to pay through their taxes for the unemployment benefits and public services of the nations of southern Europe, unlike for instance, the wealthy residents of south-east England who must subsidise the unemployed of the north-east. The trade and competitiveness imbalances were too severe – and too profitable for the Germans – to last. Yet every attempt to resolve a crisis that could push us into a second great depression is met by German prevarication. If Germany allowed the European Central Bank to print unlimited stocks of money, the ECB could shock and awe the bond markets into submission. Germany will not allow it because the national myth holds that the Weimar Republic's hyper-inflation of 1923 brought the Nazis to power. Printing money today would be to repeat the mistakes of Germany's tainted past once again. If they were truly interested in warnings from history, Germans would understand that the proximate cause of Hitler's victory – which was in 1933, not 1923 – was not inflation but the mass unemployment bought by Heinrich Brüning, \"the hunger chancellor\". He responded to the Great Crash of 1929 in much the same way that eurozone governments and the Cameron coalition have responded to the Great Crash of 2008 – by imposing an austerity that slashed salaries, cut services and left 30% of the workforce unemployed. Germany then resembled Greece, Spain and Italy now. Germany will not contemplate a dash for growth to boost demand in Europe, as a second best option. It will not allow fiscal transfers to the hardest-hit countries or a programme of debt forgiveness. It should start thinking about leaving the eurozone and allowing the rest of Europe to compete against it at a fair exchange rate. The German public never wanted the euro. It was always an affront to the best instincts of post-war Germany: a grand ideological design, that practical Germans had learnt the hard way to mistrust. But the official German ideology would denounce an attempt to leave as a return to the worst nationalist traditions of the past. The trouble with Germany is not that it is a forceful power – let alone a fascistic one – but that it is not forceful enough. It thinks it can avoid hard choices, and continue with a failed economic system that suits its interests, even as that system turn the eurozone into a prison for the peoples of Europe and sentences them to austerity without end. Is it too much to say that such behaviour is unworthy of Germany? It could be a great nation again, but only if it is has the courage to break finally from its past and accept the responsibilities that greatness entails."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/jul/11/rupert-murdoch-mr-burns-simpsons","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-11T15:37:50Z","webTitle":"Rupert Murdoch: a real-life Mr Burns?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/jul/11/rupert-murdoch-mr-burns-simpsons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/jul/11/rupert-murdoch-mr-burns-simpsons","fields":{"headline":"Rupert Murdoch: a real-life Mr Burns?","bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch has done one thing that enriches modern life – but it does not involve publishing a newspaper. Amid the boa constrictor of shame that has engulfed and engorged his British tabloid the News of the World, let's recognise the most wonderful – and totally incongruous – pearl of his global media empire: The Simpsons. It makes no apparent sense that Murdoch ever allowed this left-of-centre cartoon to be made by Fox. The reason is presumably that it is popular and a good investment. The bottom line is that when the funniest American family's creator Matt Groening created his science-fiction parody Futurama for Fox, less astronomical ratings led Fox to cancel it, although cult status later won it a reprieve. So it is success and not charity that keeps The Simpsons as such an immortal fixture of Murdoch's TV stations. There has never been any attempt by the makers to disguise their political views. In a compilation of early highlights, actor Troy McClure revealed that Groening plants hidden rightwing messages in the show. The joke, of course, was that he does the opposite and that its sceptical view of capitalist life is not hidden at all. Springfield, the town where the Simpsons live, is dominated by tycoon Monty Burns, owner of the local nuclear power station. Rapacious, heartless Mr Burns is a caricature tycoon right off a 1930s Monopoly board, yet his wealth constantly interferes with the well-being of Springfield. In his darkest hour he even blots out the town's sunlight. Is Burns a portrait of Murdoch? Not as such. Rather he is a portrait of the power of money unfettered, which may amount to the same thing. Murdoch himself has appeared on the programme, introducing himself as follows: \"I'm Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire tyrant.\" Groening said he performed the line enthusiastically. But does the fact that The Simpsons is part of his business undermine its radical spirit? Some would say the radicalism really only belonged to the show's classic early years. In the 1990s, nothing in contemporary pop culture was so brilliant and hilarious. And it was – it is – a Murdoch property. We owe the most widely criticised business empire of the age this much gratitude: it gave us the finest and funniest piece of modern televisual pop art. Murdoch's current travails resemble one of the periodic disasters that hit Mr Burns, such as the time the nuclear power station owner ran for political office and was forced to eat Blinky, the three-eyed fish, live on television. \"The old man's finished,\" say his spin doctors after he spits out the nuclear-mutated fish. \"It was over when the fish hit the floor.\" And they leave as he cries out: \"You can't do this to me – I'm Charles Montgomery Murdoch!\" Sorry, that should read Burns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2012/mar/01/children-of-the-tsunami-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-01T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"TV review: Children of the Tsunami; Make Bradford British","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/01/children-of-the-tsunami-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/01/children-of-the-tsunami-review","fields":{"headline":"TV review: Children of the Tsunami; Make Bradford British","bodyText":"'It crashes down on you with such force,\" explains 10-year-old Rikku at the start of Children of the Tsunami (BBC2), \"then it pulls you back. And you die.\" On March 11 last year, the tsunami created by a force nine earthquake along Japan's Pacific coast pulled back over 19,000 people. Among them were 74 children and nine teachers at the Okawa primary school, one of the two locations where the documentary team have chosen to let the children tell their story of the disaster. The other is around the edges of the exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima nuclear power plant where the reactors, damaged in the earthquake, sent clouds of radioactive dust into the air and contaminated everything for miles around. As with any documentary charting the unfolding of a tragedy through the eyes of its most innocent victims, Children of the Tsunami was intensely moving. The extremity of the situation rendered into simple, direct and artless speech (\"It was how you'd imagine a big monster to be,\" says one. \"I kept looking at the cars and wondering, 'Is Mum going to come?'\") is impossibly affecting. A team must tread very carefully, permitting themselves no indulgences – all of which strictures were admirably cleaved to here – if it's not to feel in some way like a cheap trick. The children's suffering, their patience, bewilderment and worry – tempered with an almost miraculous and infinite capacity to accept and adapt, even to a world they now map out in microsieverts – was beautifully caught. But behind them lay a terrible wave of adult misery, unrelievable pain and unanswered questions: about practical issues such as compensation and information about the effects and lifespan of the contamination, on which the government remains silent; and about more intangible, intractable matters such as how you shore up your psyche against a tsunami of grief. By the end you were left thinking, if you could banish the thought of the unseen radioactive forces infiltrating their cells, that perhaps the children were the lucky ones. The bodies of six of the 74 children who died at Okawa were not recovered after the waters receded. Their parents dig with their bare hands and machinery when they can get it. Fishermen find the body of Naomi's daughter Koharu six months after the tsunami – in as unbearably corrupted a state as you would imagine, and there is no comfort anywhere. Bereaved parents confront the one surviving teacher, hoping at least for an explanation of why the children were not taken up the nearby hillside when the wave came, but – as we see in raw and awful footage filmed by a parent at the meeting with the school authorities – he can only explain how he saved himself and beg for forgiveness. It was a powerful, dignified and dignifying film that made you hope the team would return to look more closely at the other issues raised in the months and years to come. Make Bradford British (Channel 4) declared itself to be an attempt to discover what \"Britishness\" really is and whether multiculturalism can succeed in a country where, outside London, the different races and religions seem to segregate quite starkly and stubbornly. This tricky sociological question, decided diversity and community experts Laurie Trott and Taiba Yasseen (or possibly some idiot spark at the arse-end of a late night brainstorming session at Channel 4), could best be addressed by sticking eight people born and bred here (who had all failed the British citizenship test and therefore – I didn't quite follow the reasoning here – didn't know what Britishness was) in a house together for a week and, umm, watching what happened. Nothing really of note, it turned out. That is, nothing beyond what we have seen a thousand times on the thousand similar semi-freak shows there have been before this. Roll up and watch a few layers of someone's ignorance and fear stripped back to reveal the – gasp! – actually non-diabolic heart that beats within. Gasp! as most people are shown to be slightly better, at bottom, than their daily lives allow them to be. Hiss! at the one villain stubbornly refusing to be enlightened yet. Marvel! as you see that even people of the same race or religion can disagree.

The technology is designed to prevent the carbon dioxide exhaust from the burning of coal and gas from entering the atmosphere and driving further climate change. It does this by either stripping the CO2 from the smokestacks of conventional power stations, or by burning the fuel in special ways to produce exhausts of pure CO2. The greenhouse gas then is buried under the ground, usually in exhausted oil and gas reservoirs. Do we need it? Almost all experts say yes. CCS can provide 20% of the carbon cuts needed by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That requires 3,000 CCS plants. The IEA also predicts that 70% of the energy used between now and 2050 will come from fossil fuels, emphasising the importance of CCS. Without it, renewables, energy efficiency and nuclear power would have to significantly overshoot their already challenging targets. How is the CO2 captured? There are three approaches being tested for power stations. Post-combustion CCS: This is the most common technology chosen for power plants. CO2 is absorbed from the exhaust of a power station by dissolving it in a liquid which is later heated to release the gas for storage. Solvents include chilled ammonia and amines but researchers are looking for more efficient ones. Post-combustion has the advantage that it can be retrofitted to some existing power stations, which will generate much of the world's CO2 for decades to come. However, the concentration of CO2 is only about 15% from coal-fired power stations and only 4% from gas stations, meaning scrubbing it from exhausts currently uses about 25% of the plant's energy, making it expensive. This would also rule out older coal plants, which already run at just 35% efficiency. The leading large-scale post-combustion CCS plant is the $1.5bn Boundary Dam project, run by Sask Power in Canada and due to enter service in 2014. Pre-combustion CCS: This technology uses a controlled amount of oxygen to turn coal or natural gas into \"syngas\", a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas is then reacted with steam to produce CO2 and hydrogen, and the latter is burned to generate power. The advantage here is that the energy penalty – the power used for separating out the CO2 – is much lower, perhaps just 11% and has no thermodynamic minimum, unlike post-combustion CCS. The downside is that it cannot be retrofitted. But it is seen as a good option for new plants. The leading large-scale pre-combustion CCS plant is the $2.7bn Kemper County gas project in Mississippi, due to start operating in 2014. Oxyfuel-combustion CCS: Here fossil fuels are burned in pure oxygen, given an exhaust stream of water and CO2, which are easily separated again cutting the energy penalty. An added advantage is that because the nitrogen present is air is missing, no NOx pollutants are formed, reducing scrubbing costs. But this technology can only be used in new plants and an air-separation unit has to be built to provide the oxygen. This approach is being used for a proposed new plant at the Drax coal-fired power station in the UK, currently the nation's biggest polluter. What happens to the CO2? Most big projects to date have got off the ground because of the need for large quantities of CO2 to drive out the last drops of oil and gas from exhausted reservoirs, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). A few planned projects intend to use such reservoirs for storage but without driving out oil and gas. The last major geological storage option is in deep saline acquifers: Norway's Sleipner project has buried a million tonnes of CO2 a year in such a acquifer since 1996, without problems. Many existing CCS plants, such as Sleipner, strip unwanted CO2 from natural gas as it is drilled from reservoirs, but fitting CCS to the plants where the gas is burned is seen as the key goal in terms of global warming. One Chinese CCS plant uses the CO2 for fizzy drinks. Which countries are leaders in CCS technology? The US has the most big projects, due to the huge market for EOR and because former President George W Bush \"wanted to do something for coal\" in the early 2000s. Barack Obama's stimulus bill of 2009 added $3bn to the state money being put into CCS in the US. Canada and Australia, both big fossil fuel producers, also have major plants. Europe has no large plants operating or in construction, but has more than 20 in planning, with the UK the leader with six. Norway has the largest CCS test facility in the world at Mongstad. China leads in Asia, but that continent remains behind the rest of the world. Will thousands of CCS plants be built in coming decades? Despite each step of carbon capture and storage being well understood, the combined technology remains relatively expensive, with costs estimated between $50 and $100 a tonne of CO2. The value placed on CO2 at present is far below that range, meaning that for CCS to flourish the carbon price needs to rise or CCS costs need to fall: in reality, both have to happen. The building of more plants will lead to technology improvements and cut costs, but depend heavily on state funding for now. International climate negotiations may push up carbon prices, but have been moving at a slow pace in recent years. The EOR market is too small and regional to support a global CCS industry. Another issue is whether people living near onshore CO2 burial sites will accept the technology – they did not in the Netherlands – although many such sites are under seas, or in remote areas. Is a revolutionary breakthrough possible? Most research is on refining the efficiency of existing technologies, but experts say a completely new, super-efficient CO2 solvent is possible in theory. Other experimental technologies are being examined, such as chemical looping, where a metal oxide provides the oxygen to burn the fuel and is then easily regenerated. In the more distant future, the US department of energy is examing whether giant stacks of efficient fuel cells could be run on hydrogen produced by pre-combustion CCS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/feb/29/french-presidential-frontrunner-francois-hollande-london","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-29T12:48:12Z","webTitle":"French presidential frontrunner makes campaign stop in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/29/french-presidential-frontrunner-francois-hollande-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/feb/29/french-presidential-frontrunner-francois-hollande-london","fields":{"headline":"French presidential frontrunner makes campaign stop in London","bodyText":"François Hollande, the leftwing French presidential frontrunner, is to stage a high-profile campaign visit to London aimed at boosting his international profile and explaining his drive to rein in the excesses of world finance. The former Socialist party leader, who has never served in government, is engaged in an increasingly bruising election fight with Nicolas Sarkozy before the first-round vote in April. The world diplomatic stage has become a battleground for the campaign since the German chancellor Angela Merkel's open support for Sarkozy followed by David Cameron's \"good luck\" message to the French incumbent at a summit in Paris earlier this month. By choosing Britain as his first major campaign visit on Wednesday, Hollande will set out his position on the European budget treaty, which he wants to renegotiate. He is also likely to explain what his proposed regulation of world finance might mean for the City. At a time when the UK is increasingly turning to French atomic energy expertise, Hollande wants to start reducing France's heavy dependence on nuclear power. The increased military co-operation between France and the UK, recently showcased in Libya, has not so far been a campaign issue for Hollande, but he wants to speed up the withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan. London has become a crucial campaign destination for candidates in the French presidential race. The UK capital is home to around 300,000 of the 400,000 French people in Britain, a population large enough to be considered politically as France's sixth biggest city. Sarkozy cemented the importance of \"Paris-on-Thames\" during his 2007 election campaign, staging a London rally urging expats to come home, saying: \"France is still your country even if you're disappointed by it.\" At a conference at King's College and a rally of the French community in London, Hollande is likely to expand on his drive for more rules for the financial markets and his recent announcement of a 75% tax bracket on annual earnings above €1m. In a book published last week he said unregulated markets had become so powerful that the City of London \"weighs so heavily\", convincing Cameron to refuse all financial reform. However, some of Hollande's regulation ideas draw on UK proposals such separating investment banking from banks' retail businesses. Elizabeth Guigou, a former minister and part of his campaign team, said the London visit was also about understanding Britain's reasoning on Europe, including Cameron's refusal to sign up to the new EU treaty. Hollande had earlier said: \"We need Britain to feel part of Europe.\" But he added that France could never have accepted Cameron's attempt to create a \"sanctuary\" from financial regulation for the City in the new European treaty. Hollande's visit starts with a lunch with the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, and the shadow cabinet at Westminster. The Socialist candidate, who unlike Sarkozy says he speaks English, does not know Cameron or Nick Clegg. He has praised Tony Blair on health and education and the length of New Labour's time in office but criticised its economic politics, saying it \"succumbed to the dominant idea that the markets could regulate themselves and … we saw the consequences.\" Hollande is not expected to meet financiers, unlike Sarkozy, who made a high-profile speech in the City on a state visit in 2008. The stakes for a London campaign trip are even higher this year because of electoral changes. For the first time in legislative elections in June, the 2.5 million French expats will be able to vote for their own MPs in overseas constituencies. The new MP for northern Europe will represent French people in the UK, Ireland, Scandinavia and the Baltic states. The majority of French expats voted for Sarkozy in 2007. In London, French expats are considered to lean to the right, but turnout tends to be low with only 30% voting in 2007. Axelle Lemaire, the Socialist candidate for MP for northern Europe, told the Guardian last year that the French community in London was more than the stereotype of rich traders. \"French people living in the UK are young, the majority under 40, there are more women than men. One third work in the public sector, especially in education. The idea of lots of French bankers in the City is only part of the picture.\" James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University, said London visits were so important to French presidential candidates, \"first, for the high-profile stage on which to project their claims to international statesmanship\", and particularly for Hollande \"to cut a figure beyond France\". He added the visit would allow the Socialist candidate \"to play to a wider gallery than his natural leftwing base\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/27/adair-turner-windfarm-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-27T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"Debate whether windfarms are ugly but not their efficiency, says Lord Turner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/27/adair-turner-windfarm-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/27/adair-turner-windfarm-interview","fields":{"headline":"Debate whether windfarms are ugly but not their efficiency, says Lord Turner","bodyText":"Claims that windfarms cannot reduce carbon emissions are \"rubbish\" and result from critics ignoring the facts and \"believing what they want to believe\", according to Lord (Adair) Turner, chairman of the government's official independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). In an interview with the Guardian, Turner said there was a legitimate debate over whether wind turbines were a visual blight on the hills of Britain, but that the debate had to be honest and critics had to accept the much higher cost of placing the turbines offshore. He added that enabling local people to profit from wind power would lead to a switch in \"deeply subjective aesthetic perceptions\". Under his leadership, the CCC's ambitious targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions have been accepted by parliament. The most recent carbon budget – to cut emissions by 50% by 2025 – was agreed only after a fierce cabinet battle. \"We have set a real standard for fact-based analysis and established a very high level of credibility,\" said Turner, who also chairs the Financial Services Authority. The controversy over windfarms has become even more heated in recent weeks, with the chairman of the National Trust, Sir Simon Jenkins, claiming the NT was \"deeply sceptical\" over wind power – only for the organisation to respond that this did not \"chime\" with its official line. Turner said that there was a \"confused\" debate on the merits of wind power, along with nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, as part of the package to replace fossil fuels. \"It is really regrettable that people leap – without reading the facts – to things that they want to believe,\" he said. \"Wind works. The idea that it is so intermittent that it is not beneficial, that is rubbish. There are countries getting large amounts of energy from wind. \"If someone argues they passionately believe that windmills are bad for the aesthetic environment and are willing to do more nuclear instead, or willing to bear the cost of offshore wind, that is a real argument. But latching on to 'they don't work', or 'they are too intermittent' or 'they are not low-carbon because of the concrete' is just a failure to read the facts.\" Turner acknowledged the expense of going offshore. \"Offshore wind today – until the costs come down and we think they will over time – is a relatively expensive way of producing electricity, because it is a new technology. But as for onshore wind, it actually is not all that much more expensive than nuclear or coal or gas once you allow for a reasonable cost of carbon.\" The visual impact of turbines varies by landscape, according to Turner, who said he did not object to turbines near his father's house in Lochgilphead, Argyll. He added: \"There is something about those big, wide, rugged, sweeping landscapes that can take windmills without destroying what it is you love about that landscape. \"On the other hand, I can completely understand that there are some downland landscapes where some great big windmill development fundamentally changes the nature of it.\" In Britain the vast majority of wind turbines and other renewables are owned by large energy companies, whereas in Germany most are owned by individuals and communities. Turner thinks this may be part of the reason for local opposition to windfarms, despite the public at a national level strongly favouring them over alternatives. \"I think the Germans have been more effective at creating a sense of community ownership of these assets that changes the dynamics of people's attitudes towards it,\" said Turner. \"Rather than looking at it and saying 'that big company dumped it here to make profit', they look at it and say 'that's ours and I get some profit from it' and as a result it turns out aesthetic perceptions are deeply subjective and you say 'I rather like it' rather than 'I rather dislike it.'\" He added: \"I think there's more opportunity for the individual wind turbine, where it is sited near a village, but you devise it so the village, the community, gets some economic benefit from it.\" Turner expects that three-quarters of the UK's wind turbines will end up being built offshore. \"But it will come at a higher cost,\" he warned. He said fact-based honesty was also an essential part of the debate over cost. \"If there is a cost of £100-150 per annum on the average bill [to build a green energy system], we need to tell people that, but also reassure them that it is £150 not £1,000 as some of the more crazy bits of the anti-climate change press would like to suggest.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2011/sep/11/weatherwatch-mirages-reflections-light","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-11T22:05:01Z","webTitle":"Weather watch: Looking for the classic mirage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2011/sep/11/weatherwatch-mirages-reflections-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2011/sep/11/weatherwatch-mirages-reflections-light","fields":{"headline":"Weather watch: Looking for the classic mirage","bodyText":"All of us are familiar with mirages. We have all seen a shimmering on the hot surface of a road that looks like water but is in fact the reflection of the sky. In the desert larger mirages can lead thirsty travellers to believe that they are approaching water. These tricks of the light require special weather conditions: still air and layers of cooler or warmer air on top of each other to literally bend the light. What is not so generally known is that these effects also occur over water and sometimes project images over large distances. It was therefore with considerable surprise that John D Heys of Guestling, near Hastings, looked towards France on 21 August and saw a group of buildings in the middle of the Channel. The French coast is 40 miles away, and while buildings and hills behind can be seen with binoculars on a clear day, these looked only a mile away. A small boat, in reality several miles out from the coast, was sailing through the middle of these buildings that were enormous by comparison. What Mr Heys was seeing was a classic mirage; the light was being bent by the layers of air of different temperature over a cool sea. His house, 107 metres above sea level, was in a perfect position to catch the magnified image of the French coast. There was no flickering, and the mirage was clear enough for Mr Heys to draw us a good likeness of a nuclear power station near Boulogne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/17/apple-cloud-computing-coal-greenpeace","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-17T14:02:11Z","webTitle":"Apple defends green credentials of cloud computing services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/17/apple-cloud-computing-coal-greenpeace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/17/apple-cloud-computing-coal-greenpeace","fields":{"headline":"Apple defends green credentials of cloud computing services","bodyText":"Apple disclosed sensitive information about energy demand at the data centre housing its iCloud service for the first time on Tuesday, defending its green credentials in the face of a campaign by Greenpeace. In a report rating 14 companies leading the migration from local computers to cloud computing, Greenpeace gave failing grades to Apple, Amazon and Microsoft for their reliance on highly polluting coal to power their data centres. But Apple said its new iCloud data centre would be the greenest ever built, and that Greenpeace had wildly over-estimated its energy demand. The new facility would use just one-fifth of the electricity estimated by Greenpeace, the company said. It would eventually draw 60% of its on-site power from renewable sources. \"Our data centre in North Carolina will draw about 20 megawatts at full capacity,\" an Apple spokeswoman said. \"We believe this industry-leading project will make Maiden the greenest data centre ever built.\" Greenpeace has been engaged in a campaign to draw attention to tech companies that rely on dirty energy to power their cloud. In addition to the tech giants, it called out Twitter for expanding its data operations from Sacramento, which uses renewable energy, to coal-heavy Atlanta. Meanwhile, the campaign group gave bonus points to Yahoo and Google for pursuing renewable sources of energy for their data centres, and for pressing government on clean-energy policy. Data centres account for a growing share of the carbon pollution associated with the IT industry. With the move to the cloud, IT companies are spending $450bn (£282bn) a year on new space for data centres. Electricity demand from data centres is expected to grow by 19% in 2012, the report said, quoting industry leaders. Many of those computer farms – like Apple's data centre in Maiden, North Carolina – are being powered by coal and nuclear energy. North Carolina gets roughly half of its energy from coal and the other half from nuclear power, a spokesman for the state's main energy company, Duke Energy, said. \"The Apple cloud is heavily powered by dirty energy, particularly coal and coal that is coming from mountain-top removal in Appalachia,\" said Gary Cook, who wrote the report, How Clean Is Your Cloud. \"It is certainly not what you would expect from a company like Apple that challenged us to think differently. Here they bought into energy that is old industry and technology.\" The data centre in Maiden occupies 500,000 sq ft. Apple spent $1bn on the facility, and reportedly plans to spend billions more in 2012. Cook was sceptical of Apple's figures for energy demand. \"I do feel that's a bit of a lowball number. That would be a very empty building they are putting there in terms of power demand if it's only 20MW. That seems disproportionally small,\" he said. Apple is also building a solar farm and a fuel cell installation for the data centre, and plans to get 60% of its on-site power from renewable sources. Microsoft would not comment on the report. Amazon said the report was based on inaccurate assumptions and data. \"Amazon web services (AWS) believes that cloud computing is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional computing. Instead of each company having their own data centre that serves just them, AWS makes it possible for hundreds of thousands of companies to consolidate their data centre use into a handful of data centres,\" spokesman Andrew Hardener said. \"The cloud enables a combined smaller carbon footprint that significantly reduces overall consumption.\" However, Twitter said it was looking into the findings. \"The Greenpeace report raises important considerations around energy efficiency. We continue to strive for greater energy efficiency as we build out our infrastructure, and we look forward to sharing more on our efforts in this space in the coming months,\" said spokeswoman Carolyn Penner. The report argues that for all their focus on innovation, tech companies are profoundly conventional when it comes to making decisions about energy needs. \"Most IT companies are currently choosing to buy their electricity off the rack, at the lowest possible price, with the focus on its quantity, not its quality,\" it said. That's been good for small towns like Maiden, which has sold itself to tech companies as a \"data centre corridor\" by offering cheap electricity. Tech companies are also notoriously unwilling to disclose information about their electricity use, on the grounds that it could be used by business rivals, Greenpeace said. Andrea Moffat of the Ceres green investment network argues that this may become unsustainable. Corporate clients of the data farms, such as insurance companies, increasingly are bowing to shareholders' demands to reveal their own carbon footprint. That is bound to have a knock-on effect on the tech companies, she said. Some companies are already moving to clean up their cloud, as Greenpeace notes in the report. Google set up its own energy division to source cleaner electricity sources, and entered into 20-year contracts to buy wind power from Iowa and Oklahoma. Facebook, which was targeted last year by the Greenpeace Unfriend Coal campaign, is building a new data centre in Sweden, its largest yet, to be powered by hydroelectricity. Moffat called for tech companies with large data centres to set renewable-energy targets. She also called on them to lobby governments to extend tax credits for wind and solar producers. Some companies have begun to take similar steps, such as eBay, which is not mentioned in the report. The online marketplace built its first data centre in Utah. It lobbied hard for legislation, passed last month, which for the first time enabled customers to purchase renewable power. The state otherwise gets virtually all of its electricity from coal. \"They have a lot of power in the policy field that we are not seeing them using,\" Moffat said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/09/mark-lynas-truth-treachery-gm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-09T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"Mark Lynas: truth, treachery and GM food","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/09/mark-lynas-truth-treachery-gm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/09/mark-lynas-truth-treachery-gm","fields":{"headline":"Mark Lynas: truth, treachery and GM food","bodyText":"What was that line in Lord of the Flies? When Roger decides to kill Piggy? He makes that irreversible transgression with something like \"a sense of delirious abandonment\". Mark Lynas couldn't quite remember, but that's exactly how he felt as he walked on to the stage, in the mid-morning of 3 January, to make his dramatic speech. The night before he'd paced among the farmers and agriculture experts who would be his audience, thinking: \"These people have no idea what I'm going to say.\" They were probably expecting to be bored and annoyed by the appearance of this raving eco-warrior. They didn't know that he'd taken the decision to stand in front of the people who were once his enemy – and confess. Back in the mid-90s he'd belonged to a \"radical cell\" of the anarchist, anti-capitalist environmental movement. He was influential – a co-founder of the magazine Corporate Watch who'd written the first article about the evils of Genetically Modified Organisms [GMOs] and Monsanto, the multinational biotech company whose work with GMOs was to become notorious. He was a law breaker. He'd pile into vans with gangs of up to 30 people and spend nights slashing GM crops with machetes. He was angry. He believed that the kind of people who'd attend the Oxford Farming Conference were ruining the world with greed. And now he was preparing to stand under spotlights and bow his head before them. He'd been nervous about it for days. He was scared that by the time his speech was over he wouldn't have any friends left at all. Once the crowd's mannered applause had died down, he began. \"My lords, ladies and gentlemen. I want to start with some apologies, which I believe are most appropriate to this audience. For the record, here and upfront, I apologise for having spent several years ripping up GM crops. I'm also sorry that I helped to start the anti-GM movement back in the mid-1990s and that I thereby assisted in demonising an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment. As an environmentalist, and someone who believes that everyone in this world has a right to a healthy and nutritious diet of their choosing, I could not have chosen a more counter-productive path. I now regret it completely.\" Fifty minutes later, the audience reacted with what he describes as \"shocked applause\". His website, on which he'd posted the text of his speech, crashed, unable to cope with the demand. He watched, on Twitter, as reaction spread around the world: Portugal, Spain, Chile, Argentina… Millions, he thinks, have now seen it. \"It was a complete demolition, not just of anti-GMO but of the whole organic thing,\" he says. \"For a lot of people, it was an 'Oh fuck' moment. They realised they'd been lied to, at a very profound level, by the very people they'd trusted.\" And what of his worst fear, that he wouldn't have any friends left at all? \"Well,\" he smiles sadly. \"That's probably what happened.\" Lynas, 39, lives in a modern terrace in a suburb of Oxford with his wife Maria, his puppy Scout and his children Tom, eight, and Rosa, six. He's handsome and fashionably presented, but in a strangely featureless way, like one of those members of Coldplay whose name nobody can remember. He gives me a cup of tea and leads me down towards his shed, with its sunken sofa, dusty curtains and shelves of sun-bleached books. He's worried about the interview and peppered me with questions beforehand: who was my editor? How many words would it be? Who was the photographer? Why did I want to write it? His anxiety is not surprising. Lynas's speech made the news internationally and, along with it, \"all the hate started coming through\". He found himself accused of being in the pay of Monsanto which, he says, \"shows that people think I have no integrity and look at me with complete contempt\". In the days when his anger came from the opposite direction, Lynas was a member of an organisation that was \"loosely called\" Earth First! It told a dramatic story about the world, in which the forces of industrialism were conspiring to bring about \"environmental apocalypse. Big corporations and capitalism in general were destroying the earth.\" Theirs was a plucky struggle against the monstrous machines of profit. \"We were the protectors of the land and the inheritors of the natural forces,\" he says. \"We were the pixies.\" Lynas first heard about the notion of genetically modifying crops in a Brighton squat in early 1996, at a meeting of about six activists that was lead by Jim Thomas, a campaigns director for Greenpeace. \"He really opened my eyes to the awfulness of what Monsanto seemed to be doing,\" he says. \"Something unnatural was being done to our food supply. Big corporations were using more chemicals so that they could take over the food chain.\" It inspired him to write his Corporate Watch story that was \"the first on Monsanto, as far as I know\". By the time of Earth First!'s next gathering, GMOs had \"become the next big thing\". Lynas lead the early workshops that spread the message further. \"The people who consider themselves leaders in the anti-GM movement today, I trained them.\" By 1997 his anger had turned to action, and the first \"decontamination actions\" to destroy experimental GM crops took place. \"We'd head out in a van with gardening tools, dark clothes, some cash and no ID.\" Arriving at around 2am, between 20 and 30 of them would work until dawn, \"just going along the line\", destroying the plants. It wasn't always this straightforward. One night while he was slashing through maize with a machete somewhere in the east of England, Lynas saw flashing lights and heard the barking of dogs. He dropped into the dirt and held still. \"For some reason the police went right past me,\" he says. \"I got out of there. I found my way through some woods to the train station. A lot of the others were attacked by dogs and arrested. It was quite scary. In an odd way, I'm quite law abiding. You know, I wear glasses. I don't want to get hit in the face with a truncheon. I'm not really into confrontational situations at all.\" Lynas played a crucial role at a sit-in, on 29 April 1998, at Monsanto's offices in High Wycombe. \"I cased the joint, printed the leaflets and hired the buses,\" he says. It was around this time, however, that Lynas began to experience the first mild cramps of rebellion. He'd begun to notice a widespread denial in the people around him. The more he recognised it, the more it felt like hypocrisy. \"Everyone thought of themselves as being tolerant and open-minded,\" he says. \"But if you said something critical about them, you'd be in quite serious trouble.\" Trouble? \"I don't think anyone would've attacked you physically. But you'd go back to your worst days at school, just feeling like the child that everyone hated. I don't really thrive in that sort of bully-boy atmosphere.\" The movement deluded itself about its non-hierarchical nature. It didn't have leaders or elections because, to them, democracy was a lie. \"But there were leaders – of which I definitely wasn't one – and everyone else was the sheep, the cannon fodder. The people who could rabble-rouse and were the most radical would rise to the top.\" The irony of all this was that Earth First! became acutely hierarchical, and in the worst possible way, \"because the hierarchy is nontransparent\". A critical fracture between Lynas and his movement occurred after London's 2000 May Day riots, which he helped organise. A branch of McDonald's was attacked, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohican, and the Cenotaph was graffitied. At a meeting of key individuals in a north London pub that followed \"everyone was saying: 'This is great',\" he remembers. \"'We've shown the corporate media!'\" Lynas, however, didn't agree. \"I thought it was a disaster. Everything we'd been trying to achieve was undermined by all the violence and window smashing. It just alienated people. I thought I'd be honest about it. Everyone looked at me in complete horror, shock and contempt.\" How did that feel? \"Deeply hostile, and deeply limiting, actually. Tolerance and open-mindedness were qualities that people paid lip service to but were not really valued. That was one of the last meetings I went to.\" Lynas had an unusual childhood, being born in Fiji and schooled for three years in Peru. His father was a scientist – a geologist who did mapping for the government – and yet was politically assertive enough to emigrate to Spain in the mid-1980s because of Margaret Thatcher. Lynas remembers Nicaraguan folk bands staying as house guests. Today, his parents live in North Wales. \"They have a little organic farm. Post-organic, really. My dad's with me in arguing the need for biological solutions, like GM, to reduce chemical use.\" Lynas's metamorphosis gathered real pace when he started work on his 2004 book High Tide. It concerned the consequences of manmade climate change and involved him touring the continents seeking out its effects. This was a cause he was happy to be swept into: climate change made a perfect subplot for his grand narrative about the world of evil capitalism ruining nature. But this new episode introduced a curious character – a nerdy stranger who would go on to corrupt the plot of his life entirely. \"I didn't want my book to be just a series of anecdotes,\" he explains, \"so I began researching the science. And I fell in love with it. I realised that science offers a window into truth that nothing else can.\" His embrace of evidence-based knowledge caused a problem. Many of his beliefs about GMOs were predicated on an extravagant dismissal of the scientific consensus. \"The whole GM thing had been about criticising scientists, saying they were corrupt, corporate shills,\" he says. \"And we definitely believed all those things. But I realised everything we were doing was deeply reductionist, basically saying: 'Scientists should shut down their labs and go and work in Tesco.' It was a kind of counter-enlightenment. People against a process.\" Lynas lived the next few years in a state of weird, gigantic dissonance. A 2005 column for the New Statesman, which expressed doubt about traditional anti-nuclear arguments, prompted activists that he knew to \"write in, saying I'd ruined their lives\". His next book, Six Degrees: Our Future in a Hotter Planet, won 2008's prestigious Royal Society prize for science writing. And yet he was still existing between narratives in a way that, inevitably, became excruciating. The last piece of \"GM crap\" he wrote was for the Guardian, the year of his award. \"I knew at the time I didn't believe it,\" he says. \"I wrote it in an internet café. I thought: 'God, I really need to have some sources for these things.' Then I thought: 'Fuck it.' I'd just had this stamp of approval from the scientific community. And then I'm writing this completely unscientific and hopelessly unintellectual thing. How embarrassing can you get?\" In November 2010 he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary, What the Green Movement Got Wrong, and a live debate that followed. In the shows he defended GMOs and nuclear power. Afterwards, he says, a member of Greenpeace \"was that close to me, shouting in my face. I literally left the studio with a bag over my head.\" Close friends felt betrayed. \"George Monbiot sent me a really devastating email.\" He also fell out with the person who'd been best man at his wedding. \"We'd been friends for 10 years. We still have no relationship.\" Lynas also experienced a more subtle realignment in his worldview. He'd been used to seeing the Green movement as the brave, scrappy underdogs. But the more he looked, the more little David began to resemble Goliath. \"Just take the numbers,\" he says. \"Greenpeace, the whole international group, is a $150m outfit [in fact, figures provided by Greenpeace show global income in 2011 as $313.4m]. Bigger than the World Trade Organisation, and much more influential in terms of determining how people think.\" For Lynas, the modern Green movement is one of undeniable force. It's changed the world \"sometimes for the better\", but not always. \"The anti-nuclear movement is partly responsible for global warming,\" he says. \"Everywhere, pretty much, where a nuclear plant was cancelled, a coal plant was built instead, and that's because of the anti-nuclear movement. The environmental movement has been very successful in regulating GM out of existence in some parts of the world.\" Lynas has been very critical of Greenpeace's policy towards a GM crop that's become totemic among campaigners. Golden rice is a crop that's been modified, by the insertion of the genes for the chemical beta-carotene, in an attempt to make it provide more vitamin A. \"Vitamin-A deficiency is one of the leading causes of death in southeast Asia,\" says Lynas. \"It's led to blindness and the death of about a quarter of a million people a year.\" Yet campaigners, including Greenpeace, lobbied against it. Greenpeace insists golden rice is a \"waste of money\" and an \"ineffective tool… [that] is also environmentally irresponsible, poses risks to human health and compromises food security\". For Lynas, its stance is \"just superstition. There are tens of thousands of kids who are dead who wouldn't be dead otherwise. I don't see how you could put this any other way. Imagine if Monsanto had been culpable in the deaths of tens of thousands of children! It would be all over the Guardian.\" (Lynas later made the partial concession that \"there have been technical hold-ups in the golden rice project, and you can't solely blame Greenpeace for the overregulation that is applied to GMOs\".) Since his Oxford Farming Conference speech, some have launched attacks on Lynas's interpretation of the science. But the rebellion against his rebellion has also been personal. Some former associates have questioned his claim to have been an influential figure. Jim Thomas, the former Greenpeace activist who first told Lynas about GMOs and lived with him for a few months, says: \"Lynas was a player, but not a very important player, and for a very short period of time. Maybe in his mind he was important, but I don't think anybody else saw him that way.\" Ultimately, says Thomas, \"I feel saddened by the whole thing. He's built a very successful career on the back of portraying people who were his friends as unthinking.\" Lynas counters that he's unable to defend himself from charges he's exaggerated his role due the illegality of the acts he and his associates were complicit in. \"People don't want their names mentioned,\" he says. But the attacks hurt. \"I've been complaining to my wife, but she said: 'Don't feel sorry for yourself. You've insulted people at the deepest level of their values. You've done something completely wounding to their very sense of self.' This was a life's work for people I was close to, and as far as they're concerned I've tried to destroy it.\" As for Lynas's life's mission, the change has been everything and nothing. He might not be battling against corporations any more, but he still feels \"as if I'm changing the world for the better in my own small way\". Nevertheless, he speaks of the betrayal and subsequent loss of his friends as a tragedy – \"but tragic in the Shakespearean sense that you could see it coming\". Indeed, how much of his metamorphosis was inevitable? Can his mutiny really constitute a moral treachery when so much of it seemed to happen to him? He was, after all, born into a family of independent spirit, to a scientist father, who was also a political radical who deified the environment. Emotional rebellion became empirical rebellion, when a book project forced him from the \"echo chamber\" of Earth First!. And then, what should he do? Try to live with it all, hounded by the dissonance of his contradictions? Or speak up and brave whatever damage might be caused? His opponents, who mutter about his \"successful career\", despite his modest circumstances, deny the complexity of human motivation. Nobody is pure. But few do as he has done, and have the courage to doubt themselves with as much vigour as they've previously doubted others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/08/lack-knowledge-effects-chernobyl-accident","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-07T23:05:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: Lack of vital knowledge about effects of the Chernobyl accident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/08/lack-knowledge-effects-chernobyl-accident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/08/lack-knowledge-effects-chernobyl-accident","fields":{"headline":"Lack of vital knowledge about effects of the Chernobyl accident","bodyText":"Mr Monbiot has a point in that there has been exaggeration of the effects of the Chernobyl accident (The unpalatable truth is that the anti-nuclear lobby has misled us all, 5 April). But equally he should acknowledge that there has been unwarranted dismissal of potential effects for which there has been no objective investigation. He is also wrong to describe the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear) as the equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Unscear document he refers to was prepared by a single lead consultant with a handful of supporting individuals and the document was approved by nominees of the states which are subscribing members of Unscear – mostly those countries with an investment in nuclear power. The document does not represent any consensus across the relevant scientific community. In fact, recently a group of experts, under the auspices of a European commission project (arch.iarc.fr), has completed an in-depth review of the health-related research on the sequelae of the Chernobyl accident to date and found that, apart from research on the thyroid cancer outbreak, the international coverage is \"unco-ordinated ... forming a patchwork ... rather than a comprehensive, structured attempt to delineate the overall health consequences of the accident\". The truth is we, as the international scientific community, don't know the true impact of the accident on health because the funds have not been available to thoroughly investigate it. More in-depth reading of the Unscear document will reveal several instances where Unscear draws attention to this lack of vital knowledge. The Chernobyl accident has been a political football fought over by the pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies for 25 years at the expense of obtaining the best information on which to base our judgments, which Mr Monbiot rightly calls for. Keith Baverstock Department of environmental sciences, University of Eastern Finland • Your report (Loophole in bill could allow nuclear bailouts, 5 April) explains how the government is planning to water down its already transparently false assurances that citizens will not have to pay any of the cost of nuclear power. Already, we know that accident liability is limited to a derisory £140m. All this is a tribute to the inordinate power of the nuclear power industry's lobby and to the craving of politicians to centralise power in all its aspects. It is bizarre that this is happening as the Japanese government is discharging over 11,000 tons of radioactive water into the Pacific, as independent analysts are saying it could take years to get the disaster at Fukushima under control and, concurrently, the nuclear industry is assuring us, yet again, that the next generation of nuclear power stations will be much safer than previous ones.

He was respected as much by his opponents as by adversaries within his own party and, at times of strife, by the warring factors within the mining industry, which he was proud to call his own. He marched alongside Arthur Scargill during the difficult days of opposition to pit closures and the miners' strike of 1984, but was ready to admit privately to his doubts about Scargill's controversial leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers. The MP for Wansbeck for 14 years from 1983, he was not well known outside Northumberland and the parliamentary party at Westminster. But though he did not seek public attention, he was one of the stalwarts of the Labour party in the north-east, with a reputation for being honest, fair, straightforward and down to earth. His politics came from the left of the party, but he was regarded as a fully paid-up member of the \"sensible left\", and, in 1990, he joined the opposition whips' office as the northern whip. He also chaired the northern group of Labour MPs in 1991-92, having been its secretary for five years until 1990. Born John Thompson, but always known as Jack, in the then pit town of Ashington, he was the son of a clerk, Nicholas Thompson, and his wife Lilian. He grew up there, and his last campaign, after retiring from Westminster in 1997, was to save the Ashington leisure centre from closure. He went to Wansbeck primary school, Bothal secondary modern, Ashington Mining College and Ashington Technical College. After training as an electrical engineer, he joined the National Coal Board as a shift charge engineer at Ellington colliery. His career in politics was a steady one. He joined Labour in 1960 and became the secretary and agent to the local constituency five years later. He was elected first in 1970 to Newbiggin urban district council, where he chaired the highways committee, and then for five years from 1974, after local government reorganisation, he was a member of the successor Wansbeck district council, chairing the planning committee. He was also elected to Northumberland county council in 1974, became opposition leader in 1978 and leader from 1981. Election to the House of Commons led to him resigning as leader, but he remained a member of the council for a further two years. He chaired the policy and resources and employment committees on the county council, and played a large part in ensuring that plans for a nuclear power station at Druridge Bay were shelved. Later, in the Commons, he also opposed the development of Sizewell, Suffolk. Although convinced that nuclear power was not in the community's interest, he was also motivated by his love of the local landscape. After he married Margaret Clarke in 1952, they travelled in a motorcycle and sidecar and subsequently took up caravanning. He was a trade union MP, sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers, and at Westminster was assiduous in pursuing the concerns of those he represented. In 1984, at the height of the miners' strike, he was one of those involved in a protest at the deduction of £16 from benefits paid to the dependants of those on strike that led to the suspension of the parliamentary sitting. He was a delegate from Westminster to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union, and in 1996 became deputy lieutenant of Northumberland. He is survived by Margaret and their two children, Norma and Brian. • Jack (John) Thompson, politician, born 27 August 1928; died 21 July 2011"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/02/fukushima-fuel-rods-completely-melted","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-02T07:36:33Z","webTitle":"Fukushima fuel rods may have completely melted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/02/fukushima-fuel-rods-completely-melted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/02/fukushima-fuel-rods-completely-melted","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima fuel rods may have completely melted","bodyText":"Fuel rods inside one of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant may have completely melted and bored most of the way through a concrete floor, the reactor's last line of defence before its steel outer casing, the plant's operator said. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said in a report that fuel inside reactor No 1 appeared to have dropped through its inner pressure vessel and into the outer containment vessel, indicating that the accident was more severe than first thought. The revelation that the plant may have narrowly averted a disastrous \"China syndrome\" scenario comes days after reports that the company had dismissed a 2008 warning that the plant was inadequately prepared to resist a tsunami. Tepco revised its view of the damage inside the No 1 reactor – one of three that suffered meltdown soon after the 11 March disaster – after running a new simulation of the accident. It would not comment on the exact position of the molten fuel, or on how much of it is exposed to water being pumped in to cool the reactor. More than nine months into the crisis, workers are still unable to gauge the damage directly because of dangerously high levels of radiation inside the reactor building. \"Uncertainty involved in the analysis is significant, due to the uncertain nature of the original conditions and data used,\" Tepco said in a report. It said the concrete \"could have been penetrated\", but added that the fuel remained inside the reactor's outer casing. Previously, the firm had said that only some of the fuel had burned through its inner pressure vessel and dropped into the containment vessel. \"Almost no fuel remains at its original position,\" Tepco said. The simulation shows that the fuel may have penetrated the concrete floor by up to 65cm, just 37cm from the reactor's outer steel wall. Tepco said that about 60% of the fuel in the two other reactors that experienced meltdown had dropped onto the concrete base, but had caused less damage. After the tsunami, workers at the site stopped injecting reactor No 1 with water for about 14 hours, resulting in more serious damage than sustained by the two other reactors. The company added, however, that fuel in all three reactors was being kept stable by cooling water, adding that the erosion had stopped. It said the findings would not affect plans to bring the reactors to a safe state, known as cold shutdown, possibly by the middle of the month. Japanese authorities may announce cold shutdown on 16 December, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Friday. That stage is reached when water used to cool the fuel rods remains below boiling point, thereby preventing the fuel from heating up again. Stabilising the reactors is just the first stage of the operation to resolve the crisis. Tepco has said it won't be able to begin removing the fuel for another 10 years. Decommissioning the plant could take at least 30 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/apr/18/fracking-and-wind-wrong-debates","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-18T19:29:00Z","webTitle":"On fracking and wind we are having the wrong debates | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/18/fracking-and-wind-wrong-debates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/18/fracking-and-wind-wrong-debates","fields":{"headline":"On fracking and wind we are having the wrong debates","bodyText":"It's been a big week for alternative energy sources. On Tuesday, the British Geological Survey effectively greenlit fracking, with its conclusion that the earthquake risk was low. Tomorrow National Opposition to Windfarms launches its campaign in the House of Lords. My instincts are pro-wind and anti-fracking, from a straight climate change perspective: wind is renewable and not harmful, while shale gas is not renewable and contributes as much or more – much more, according to a study by Cornell University – to the greenhouse effect than either oil or coal. The anti-fracking lobby should just stick with this argument – that if you're serious about halting global warming you have to concentrate on energy sources that don't contribute to it. However they don't want to – believing, possibly correctly, that the political will to prevent irreparable climate change just isn't there. Instead, the anti-frackers range freely around in their opposition; some of it's grounded and some isn't. What strikes me is the similarity in approach from the anti-wind camp and the anti-frackers. First, they talk about the aesthetics of these energy sources – National Opposition to Windfarms talks about windfarms destroying tourism, and their opening gambit is that the area becomes so unspeakably unattractive that people will simply stop going there. In the Ribble Valley and across the areas affected by fracking, the sheer ugliness of industry is emphasised. There's a counter-argument in both cases. The aesthetics of windfarms are pretty subjective – some people like them. National Opposition to Windfarms quotes a survey from the Welsh Tourist Board in which 71% of respondents said turbines spoilt the environment; Renewables UK quotes a survey in which an almost identical proportion, 75%, finds the effect of turbines either positive or neutral. Fracking occurs predominantly underground, so while heavy machinery is rarely attractive, it's nothing like as ugly as a coal mine or a nuclear power station. But, more important, unless you're prepared to stop using energy or you have an alternative, \"I don't like the look of it\" isn't enough. \"It's too expensive to produce\" isn't enough, either – it will look a lot less expensive when the existing energy sources run out. Windfarms are ahead of frackers in the way they comprehend their obligations. They pay rent to landowners but also £1,000 per megawatt a year to the community – and this sector is also creating a new model for small-scale finance. You can, from Saturday, invest in a wind turbine in the Forest of Dean for as little as £5, with the expectation of a return. More on that another day; there are so far no small-scale investment plans for fracking the Bowland Basin in Lancashire. But there is a huge swath of shale gas in the north of England; the mineral rights are owned by the crown. That money could be sucked into the centre, or it could be kept in Lancashire, dispersed to local authorities. What would the north-south divide look like then? Is there any requirement to privilege local companies in the granting of contracts, either for wind energy or shale gas? Where there isn't, why isn't there? What would society look like if the shareholders in its major energy companies were regular people on median incomes? What would it look like if the people living above the gas supplies were its beneficiaries? These questions will affect the wealth distribution of this country for the next 200 years. And yet what does the debate concentrate on? How many jobs are created building a road to the well site? How much a unit of wind energy costs to produce? It's so narrow as to be a distraction. Finally, both the anti-winds and the anti-frackers are guilty of such overstatement as to collapse their arguments. Respectable anti-windfarmers generally don't make the case for adverse health effects, but on the ground protesters are still talking about infrasound and flicker, and how they cause suicide. National Opposition to Windfarms claims losses to bird life that are disputed by crowning bird fanciers the RSPB. Anti-frackers claim that France has a moratorium on fracking because it has learned and understood the lessons of the film Gasland. If this is true, it is remarkable: not just because France's geology is different to that of the film's US location, but also because the scientific arguments lodged in that film are nothing like a done deal. There's a scene in which someone turns on a tap, and gas comes out that you can light with a match. Scientists contest that this was localised methane in the aquifer and nothing to do with the fracking process. Thermogenic methane is associated with gas production, while biogenic methane isn't, and it's apparently easy to tell the difference. People counter with \"well, they would say that, wouldn't they?\" – that point was made by the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission of Colorado – but you can't cherrypick the science that suits you and reject that which doesn't. Frackers, incidentally, believe France's moratorium is linked to lobbying by the nuclear industry. As enjoyable as it is to see big businesses eat each other for a change, it's not exactly the sight of everything working in the public interest. I remain pro-wind and anti-fracking; but my main worry is that both will go ahead, and the real concerns of energy users – proximal or not – won't be resolved or even discussed, just swamped under anxious misinformation.

The consortium that runs the biggest nuclear site in Britain said the £9m payout reflected a strong performance under an annual \"target achievement scheme\" aimed at improving productivity and safety. The £9m present comes at a difficult time for the workforce of Europe's biggest atomic site. Up to 2,000 staff are faced with being moved to other locations, and up to 600 jobs are at risk as a result of the closure of the Sellafield mixed-oxide plant. It is also a critical time for Cumbrian local councils, which are considering plans to build a long-term repository for high-level radioactive waste in the region. Sellafield Ltd, owned by a consortium that includes Areva of France, which runs the site, confirmed that half the bonus was payable under \"Aceman\", an employee participation scheme partly based on workers taking part in meetings. \"Aceman is a tool adopted by Sellafield Ltd that is used in the nuclear power industry to align and focus the daily activities and behaviours of employees, teams and the company itself on performance excellence, by allowing everybody to contribute to improving performance,\" said a company spokeswoman. She said Sellafield, which provides storage for the world's biggest civil plutonium stockpile of 100 tonnes, had passed a number of decommissioning milestones over the year, including the defuelling of the reactor at Calder Hall, the world's first provider of nuclear electricity. The improved operational performance should help Sellafield reduce its costs, as will a plan to move 2,000 staff into local towns such as Whitehaven on the coast. \"In addition to meeting [our] business needs, this would have the added benefit of boosting economic activity within our towns,\" said the company, which is a dominant private sector employer in an area with high levels of unemployment. However, no final decision has yet been taken on the issue. Neither has it been decided what should happen to staff displaced by the closure of the mixed-oxide plant, which reprocessed spent fuel brought in from the far east and then shipped back again. This decision was taken following Japan's move to run down its nuclear industry in the aftermath of the Fukushima crisis. About 200 staff are expected to be employed on the dismantling of the facility, which cost £500m to build and never functioned at anything like maximum capacity. The company will try to redeploy the remaining 400 workers although some could eventually face redundancy. Nuclear workers at Sellafield tend to be highly skilled and far better paid than average Cumbrians, who are largely employed in sectors such as the tourism and leisure business that comes out of the surrounding Lake District. Billions of pounds a year is poured into decommissioning the wider Sellafield site and more public money would have to be used if a waste dump were constructed. A west Cumbria \"partnership\" of local authorities and others has recently begun consultation on a geological disposal programme that could involve removing as much rock and earth as the building of the Channel tunnel. There are concerns that a permanent underground nuclear store would damage the Lake District's image."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/may/02/mervyn-king-we-did-too-little-warn-economic-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-02T21:35:00Z","webTitle":"Sir Mervyn King admits: we did too little to warn of economic crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/02/mervyn-king-we-did-too-little-warn-economic-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/may/02/mervyn-king-we-did-too-little-warn-economic-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Sir Mervyn King admits: we did too little to warn of economic crisis","bodyText":"Sir Mervyn King has admitted that the Bank of England should have \"shouted from the rooftops\" its concerns about the looming disaster in the City as he warned that Britain's recovery from recession would be a long, slow process. The Bank's governor urged the coalition government to press ahead with reforms that would ringfence the high-street operations of banks from their speculative activities, after blaming the last Labour government for allowing the financial sector to take ever bigger gambles in the build-up to the financial crisis of 2007-08. King said that the decision by Gordon Brown to strip Threadneedle Street of its powers to regulate banks had left him unable to do more than \"issue reports and preach sermons\" as the financial system became \"increasingly fragile\". While accepting that \"no one could quite bring themselves to believe that in our modern financial system the biggest banks in the world could fall over\", the governor said the Bank had been aware of the precarious position of institutions that were lending too much. \"That isn't to say we were blind to what was going on\", he said in the BBC Today Programme Lecture, adding that for several years the Bank of England and other central banks had warned that the financial markets were underestimating the risks they were taking. \"So why, you might ask, did the Bank of England not do more to prevent the disaster? We should have. But the power to regulate banks had been taken away from us in 1997. Our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons. And we did preach sermons about the risks.\" Looking back at the events since global financial markets froze up in August 2007, King said the Bank had not imagined the scale of the disaster that would occur when the risks it had identified crystallised. The crisis led to a three-day run on Northern Rock – the first on a British high street bank since the 1860s – and, a year later, the part-nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail, that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much, and that so-called 'light-touch' regulation hadn't prevented any of this,\" King said. \"And in the crisis, we tried, but should have tried harder, to persuade everyone of the need to recapitalise the banks sooner and by more. We should have preached that the lessons of history were being forgotten – because banking crises have happened before.\" The financial crisis led to the deepest slump in the UK output since the second world war, but King defended the Bank's handling of monetary policy in the pre-crash years. Recessions, he said, were supposed to follow booms and periods of high inflation: there seemed no reason in this case to expect the worst recession since the 1930s. \"In the five years before the onset of the crisis, across the industrialised world growth was steady and both unemployment and inflation were low and stable. Whether in this country, the United States or Europe, there was no unsustainable boom like that seen in the 1980s; this was a bust without a boom.\" The governor was critical of a banking system that had \"overextended\" itself, noting that, by the end of 2006, the banks had borrowed £50 for every pound provided by their own shareholders. Problems were building in the banking system, he said, noting \"on all sides there was a failure of imagination to appreciate the scale of the fragilities and their potential consequences\". King added: \"In good times, banks took the benefits for their employees and shareholders, while in bad times the taxpayer bore the costs. For the banks, it was a case of heads I win, tails you – the taxpayer – lose.\" The governor expressed strong support for moves to ensure that banks are better regulated, operate under a framework that ensures they can fail without harming depositors, and are restructured so that day-to-day banking services are kept distinct from \"complex and potentially risky trading activities\". He said: \"For the sake of future generations, we too must be bold and decisive and, while the memory is fresh, learn the lessons from this crisis. Reform is essential. \"We don't build nuclear power stations in densely populated areas; nor should we allow essential banking services and risky investment banking activities to be carried out in the same 'too important to fail' bank. \"Last autumn, the independent commission on banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers and comprising some of our most brilliant bankers and economists, published recommendations on how to do this. It's vital that parliament legislates to enact these proposals sooner rather than later.\" Britain's economy is still more than 4% smaller than it was when activity peaked in the first quarter of 2008 and King said recovery was taking longer than expected. \"The present crisis is far from over, as events in the euro area illustrate weekly. Our own economy is still not back to health. Although inflation has fallen back in recent months, it is still too high. And despite efforts to stimulate the economy, the recovery is proving slower than we had hoped. It will come. But dealing with the consequences of our 'bad banking situation' is likely to be a long, slow process.\" Although concerted action by the world's leading nations prevented a full-scale financial collapse in late 2008, King said that the bank bailouts came too late to prevent the financial crisis spilling over into the world economy. \"The realisation of the true state of the banking system led to a collapse of confidence around the world and a deep global recession. Over 25m jobs disappeared worldwide. And unemployment in Britain rose by over a million. To many of you this will seem deeply unfair, and it is. I can understand why so many people are angry.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/18/fukushima-rice-banned-by-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-18T08:06:44Z","webTitle":"Fukushima rice banned by Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/fukushima-rice-banned-by-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/18/fukushima-rice-banned-by-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima rice banned by Japan","bodyText":"The Japanese government has banned rice shipments from an area of Fukushima prefecture after tests revealed they contained levels of radioactive caesium that exceed safe limits. It is the first time the government has banned shipments of rice since an earthquake and tsunami badly damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 11 March, sending three of its six reactors into meltdown in the worst accident of its kind since Chernobyl. The rice, from the Onami district in the prefecture's north-east, was being prepared for sale but none had found its way on to the market, reports said. Tests conducted this week showed that a batch of Onami rice harvested in the autumn contained up to 630 becquerels of caesium per kg, compared with the government's safe limit of 500 becquerels per kg. The finding prompted the government to order the governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, to halt all rice shipments from the area's 154 farms. The chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, said he had asked Sato to tighten monitoring of rice grown in the area. \"If we confirm the safety of the grain in the region, we may consider lifting a ban on shipments,\" he said. \"The rice in question was caught before shipments. Not even a single grain from the patch is in circulation.\" Sato said: \"I can tell you that you don't have to worry at all about rice that has already been shipped.\" Last month, however, he had given assurances that rice from Fukushima was safe following tests on batches grown in 48 parts of the prefecture, including Onami, located about 40 miles (60km) from the plant. Onami accounted for 1.8% of Fukushima's total rice crop and the radiation levels, while above the government's safety threshold, did not pose a risk to health, reports said. But the discovery is certain to reignite concern over the safety of food from the Fukushima area and the authorities' ability to ensure tainted produce does not go on sale. In July the government banned all shipments of beef from the prefecture after meat from more than 500 cows that had been fed contaminated straw was sent to other parts of the country. Bans have been imposed on some vegetables and milk, and elevated levels of radiation have been found in green tea grown 250 miles from Fukushima Daiichi. Supermarkets in Tokyo are divided over whether to accept rice from Fukushima. Some stores and wholesalers have taken advantage of the grain's comparatively low price but only five supermarket chains are selling it in the capital. The radiation scare is unlikely to affect rice distribution in Japan. Fukushima prefecture produced almost 440,000 tonnes of rice last year – the fourth-largest source in the country – and the Onami district accounts for just 192 tonnes of the nationwide total."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/04/japan-disaster-peak-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T10:03:04Z","webTitle":"What Japan's disaster tells us about peak oil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/04/japan-disaster-peak-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/04/japan-disaster-peak-oil","fields":{"headline":"What Japan's disaster tells us about peak oil","bodyText":"For large parts of eastern Japan that were not directly hit by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, including the nation's capital, the current state of affairs feels very much like a dry-run for peak oil. This is not to belittle the tragic loss of life and the dire situation facing many survivors left without homes and livelihoods. Rather, the aim here is to reflect upon the post-disaster events and compare them with those normally associated with the worst-case scenarios for peak oil. The earthquake and tsunami affected six of the 28 oil refineries in Japan and immediately petrol rationing was introduced with a maximum of 20 litres per car (in some instances as low as 5 litres). On 14 March, the government allowed the oil industry to release 3 days' worth of oil from stockpiles and on 22 March an additional 22 days' worth of oil was released. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which serves a population of 44.5 million, lost one quarter of its supply capacity as a result of the quake, through the closedown of its two Fukushima nuclear power plants (Dai-ichi and Dai-ni), as well as eight fossil fuel based thermal power stations. Subsequently, from 14 March 2011 onwards, TEPCO was forced to implement a series of scheduled outages across the Kanto region (the prefectures of Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, and Kanagawa). While the thermal power stations may restart operations soon, the overall shortfall will become even more difficult to manage over the summer period when air conditioning is utilized. The reality is that these power cuts could continue for years, especially since the one of the two Fukushima nuclear plants has effectively become a pile of radioactive scrap. Related to this, when the Tokyo Metropolitican Government began to announce levels of radioactive contamination of drinking water above permissible levels, this was immediately followed by the rapid sell-out of bottled water, even after the levels dropped again. When bottled water is on sale in local convenience stores after some restocking took place, each customer is only allowed to purchase one 2 litre bottle. Immediately after the quake, supermarkets outside the disaster area in Tokyo and other major cities began to sell out of foodstuffs, including various instant meals. The electrical appliance stores sold out of batteries, flashlights and portable radios. As we all know, the twin natural and human tragedies are having impacts beyond the Tohoku region where Fukushima lies, and the Greater Tokyo area. It has been difficult for Japan's notoriously efficient industries to maintain production, given that they rely on just-in-time systems and which have supply plants (for needed parts) that are located in the zone impacted by these combined disasters. One example is in car production, where major firms have had to suspend work at their factories when key parts are no longer available from the affected region. The fragility of this system of industrial production is glaringly obvious and it is something that peak oil commentators have warned of multiple times. These food and bottled water shortages, power cuts, fuel-rationing and breakdowns in just-in-time manufacturing have been anticipated by those who take peak oil seriously. It is almost as if eastern Japan is experiencing a peak oil rehearsal, although other regions of Japan are virtually unaffected. If proponents of peak oil are correct, then the rest of the world may experience something similar within the next 5 to 10 years, and hence it is important that we learn valuable lessons from Japan's response to the current circumstances. What makes the current situation different from peak oil? Under a peak oil scenario, the entire world (not just one country) would be affected by a continuous decline in global oil production. The rate of that decline is the key factor. If the rate is very gradual (a few percent points each year), then economies and their food and energy production and distribution systems in particular will have more time to adapt. In such circumstances, we could envisage a significant decline in the flow of goods and people across the globe — a slowing or a potentially grinding halt. For a country like Japan that relies heavily on the import of food, having only 40% self-sufficiency, the real peak oil scenario would have dire impacts. Under the present situation, Japan can still rely on imports to alleviate food supply problems. This is fortunate as over 600 farms, 125 harbours and 2,333 fishing vessels were destroyed by the tsunami, not to mention the thousands of people who made their livelihoods from agriculture and fishing who are either deceased or displaced. Furthermore, the 20-30 km zone around the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant may not be used for food production for some time to come and the good reputations of those areas for providing clean produce may take even longer to be restored. In a global peak oil scenario, it is highly likely that food prices would increase significantly. To some extent this is happening. For instance, in February 2011 it was reported that food prices reached a record high due to poor harvests, rising oil prices (at US$105 per barrel) and increasing demand for foodstuffs due to rising population and incomes. The conflict in Libya was predicted to further exacerbate the food and oil prices. In fact, conflict and civil unrest in oil producing countries is another facet of various peak oil scenarios as nations scramble for the remaining resources. It is something that Richard Heinberg describes as the \"last one standing\" scenario in which powerful countries will use their assets to promote their own survival at the expense of everyone else. So in the current predicament facing Japan, the situation is ameliorated by the ability of different nations to offer support and continue trading (for instance, Evian is selling a lot of bottled water to Japan at the moment). This certainly would be more difficult under some of the extreme peak oil scenarios, where rapid oil decline is involved. Lessons from Japan While the consequences of the current disaster for Japan have been tragic in terms of the loss of life and while it is clear that the emotional, psychological and economic impacts are enormous, there are real signs of hope. The first important lesson to recognize is the way that Japan's leaders acted rapidly and responsibly. We have already indicated that fuel rationing was in place from 12 March 2011. The reality is that Japan is one of the most disaster-prepared nations in the world and regularly undertakes wide-scale drills. This practice proved to be of vital importance in helping people, communities and institutions cope with the major challenges that they have had to face. Government officials quickly recognized that people were hoarding food supplies and began to publicly request that they only buy what they need. This was followed up by a series of public service announcements by the Japan Ad Council under theme of \"What I can do now.\" The Minister in charge of consumer affairs, Renho Murata, frequently called on people not to panic buy and hoard food. She argued that this kind of activity was undermining the ability to provide relief supplies to the quake hit areas. At the same time, the general public and the private sector in the Kanto region were encouraged to comply with the scheduled power outages and to significantly reduce their energy consumption. Everybody responded positively – keen to play their part in solving this problem. Prime Minister Naoto Kan in particular made an appeal to the people of Japan on 13 March 2011 when he said, \"We Japanese have overcome many very trying situations in the past to create our modern society of peace and prosperity. I firmly believe that through our citizens working together to respond to this great earthquake and tsunami, we will certainly be able to overcome this crisis.\" This message has been echoed across the media and the Japanese public has responded by showing calmness, patience, respect for each other and mutual support. If anything, they have exemplified Richard Heinberg's power down scenario — the path of cooperation, conservation and sharing. Whether they can hold true to this path over a prolonged period of time remains to be seen. In the global Transition Movement, they often refer to the \"head, heart and hand\" approach to coping with peak oil and climate change, as discussed in Rob Hopkin's Transition Handbook. Put simply, the head signifies the exploration needed about how we can re-orient our lives to become more local and small scale as our awareness increases of the energy crisis we are heading into. The heart symbolizes how we can generate positive visions of the future and how they can be harnessed to overcome the feelings of powerlessness in the face of these immense challenges. The hands are a representation about understanding how the transition model can be employed in practice for specific communities. For many communities in eastern Japan, the current circumstances represent the first time they have had to consider questions about food and energy security. The vast majority appear, quite naturally, to share the overwhelming desire to get back to normal, back to the way things were before. But there are also signs of the head, heart and hand approach as many Japanese commentators are asking questions about how will develop in the future. If Japan is to build back better, then it should perhaps do so by building more resilient, more locally oriented communities in the areas affected by the quake and tsunami, and beyond. In fact, this is a chance to reconsider completely the development path for Japan towards one that is less vulnerable, less reliant upon fossil fuels, and ideally a low carbon society. To borrow the words of Prime Minister Kan once again when he called upon his compatriots: \"Through this resolve, let us all now — each and every individual — firmly reinforce our bonds with our families, friends, and communities, overcoming this crisis to once more build an even better Japan.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/17/investors-wind-energy-subsidy-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-17T13:32:42Z","webTitle":"Investors warn against delaying wind energy subsidy cut decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/17/investors-wind-energy-subsidy-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/17/investors-wind-energy-subsidy-cut","fields":{"headline":"Investors warn against delaying wind energy subsidy cut decision","bodyText":"Investors have warned that government delays in deciding the future of onshore wind energy subsidies could jeopardise billions of pounds of investment and damage the prospects for new green jobs in the UK. A decision on whether onshore wind energy subsidies should be cut by 10%, as the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has proposed, or by 25%, as the Treasury wants, was expected this week. However, the two departments and senior cabinet members are still at war over the changes and the decision has been deferred – potentially for months, though the government refused to estimate how long the delay would be. Investors and renewable companies told the Guardian the delay – and the perception that is being created of a government at war with itself over the policy – would severely damage investor confidence and jeopardise the planned flow of billions of pounds into the UK's economy. Luca Concone, founding partner of the Real Asset Energy Fund, said his company was actively looking to invest more than €400m in renewable energy assets in one of several countries, including the UK, Poland and Turkey, but would only make such investment in stable conditions. He said the UK was becoming a much less attractive place to invest because of policy uncertainty and the seeming reluctance of the government to back renewables. He told the Guardian: \"I don't think cutting back on renewable energy support is the right way to go. The level of subsidy in the UK is already far below that of other major European economies, such as Germany and Italy, and cutting that still further is the wrong message to send out to investors. Like most big investors, we look for stability and just talking about policy uncertainty is really bad for us.\" Concone said the impression of a government at war with itself over environmental policies would discourage investors. \"The coalition does not speak with one voice on this. We as investors don't understand why the government is looking to make savings on this policy, when the savings involved are peanuts and what will happen if you do this is that you will lose out on huge opportunities for boosting the economy, creating jobs and generating more revenue for the future.\" Investors looking around Europe for renewable energy opportunities would weigh up the attractions and risks on offer, Concone said, and the UK was falling behind as Germany offered about €8bn a year to boost renewable investment, with Italy at about €6bn, compared with about £1bn in the UK. Keith Anderson, ScottishPower's chief corporate officer; said: \"We are worried by reports that the announcement on the outcome of the ROC Banding review may have been deferred again. One of the key advantages of the UK as a place to invest is the predictable nature and stability of its regulatory regime. Sticking to the evidence and the timetable is key to investor confidence. We know that maintaining support for relatively inexpensive onshore wind is likely to be the best option for customers, and we see no reason why an outcome can't be agreed before the Olympics begin.\" The amount the chancellor is likely to save from slashing the onshore wind subsidy is likely to amount to about £20m a year by some estimates. But green experts said that saving would be far outweighed by the lost opportunities from overseas investment in the UK's energy infrastructure. Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, the trade body for the wind industry, said: \"We are urgently calling for the government to reach an agreement [on the subsidy] as quickly as possible. The economic evidence is crystal clear – it shows that there is no case for cutting support for onshore wind beyond the 10% originally proposed and consulted upon in the government's own review. Any further delay in an announcement could have a devastating impact on investor confidence, job creation and the deployment of clean energy.\" She added: \"It would be unacceptable if the decision were to be delayed until September – especially as the new banding levels are due to come into force just seven months later, in April 2013. It is imperative that investment and job creation are not harmed in one of our key growth sectors. The industry is demanding clarity at the earliest possible opportunity as a matter of urgency.\" Decc told the Guardian that \"theoretically\" a decision on the cuts could be made within a few weeks, even though parliament is in recess. However, the department admitted that in reality it could take much longer, though the spokeswoman refused to speculate on how long it could take. \"We want it to be as soon as possible,\" she said. Dale Vince, founder of green energy supplier Ecotricity, said the government must reject the Treasury's proposals to cut onshore wind subsidies by a quarter. He said: \"[That] could be devastating for the renewables industry. First, the government made large solar projects untenable by dramatically cutting support, then they slashed support for small solar, which led to legal challenges and a big hole in the renewables industry – now onshore wind is in the firing line. Cuts must be proportionate to the rate that costs are falling in the sector. A cut of 25% would be a declaration of war by the government on the renewable energy industry – a sign it wants to flatten the industry in order to pave the way for a new round of nuclear and gas – just what Britain really doesn't need.\" Other renewable energy firms have also voiced disappointment over the delay in the decision. Gordon MacDougall, chief operating officer of RES UK &amp; Ireland, explained that postponing a decision about ROCs raised questions over the government's green credentials, describing the delay as \"extremely disappointing\". \"The government is exacerbating the uncertainty created by the broader electricity market reform package and sending a worrying message to the industry and to investors in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, is damaging for global investor confidence in the UK as a whole as 'the greenest government ever' is seen as prioritising short-term political views over cornerstone strategic policies based on sound economic evidence. \"The lack of long term certainty fostered by the delays to the RO banding is making it harder for us to implement our multi-billion pound investment plans for the next five years.\" Ed Gill, head of external affairs at Good Energy, added that the delay could have effects for investment in renewable energy. \"Investors need to be confident that support rates are set by a transparent, evidence-based process and these kind of delays don't help,\" he said, adding: The government has talked a lot about delivering longevity and certainty for renewables investors; now's the time to deliver. That's important not only to attract investment, but also to reduce its risk and therefore ultimately the cost to the consumer.\" Concern over investment was also a factor for the Swedish firm Vattenfall. Peter Wesslau, UK country manager, said: \"Since late 2008 Vattenfall has invested nearly £2bn in building five on and offshore windfarms as it saw the UK as an attractive growth market with a relatively stable regulatory regime and strong political support. \"The delay to a decision on the RO, on top of proposed fundamental reforms to the UK electricity market, is unsettling and could indicate that support for wind power is in decline. Until there are greater degrees of certainty we will continue to factor in government indecision into our investment decisions.\" He pointed out that onshore wind showed the highest absolute increase in electricity generation in the first quarter of 2012 – as a result of an increase of 51% in capacity, from 2.4 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first quarter of 2011 to 3.6TWh, according to Decc figures from June. Green campaigners also warned that the Treasury's attempts to slash the renewable subsidy by more than the 10% that had been agreed last year would backfire on job creation and the economic recovery. Jenny Banks, energy policy officer at WWF UK, said: \"It appears that Treasury are actively seeking to undermine the renewables industry. It's ironic given this sector is the one shining beacon of potential growth and job creation. Osborne appears to be digging his heels in on an argument about £20m a year on the level of support for onshore wind. This is dwarfed by the £2.8bn a year reported to be required by EDF to support new nuclear power which, it has emerged, is more costly than any form of wind generation. Yet we hear nothing from the Treasury about this cost.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/2011/dec/19/north-korea-facts-secretive-state","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-19T13:33:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea: 10 facts about one of the world's most secretive states","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/19/north-korea-facts-secretive-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/19/north-korea-facts-secretive-state","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: 10 facts about one of the world's most secretive states","bodyText":"North Korea's state media has announced that Kim Jong-il, the \"dear leader\", is dead. His son, Kim Jong-un, has been named as his successor. North Korea is one of the world's most secretive states. Some info about the country and its people are known, though most is based on estimates from outside agencies - the statistics from North Korea itself would probably read quite differently. We've pulled together some key data from the Datablog. See what you can do with it. Population The population currently stands at around 24.45 million, according to the UN Population Division, a growth of 151% since 1950. The UN estimates that the North Korean population will rise to 24.55 million by 2100. Corruption North Korea is officially the world's most corrupt country, according to the Corruption index 2011 from Transparency International, which ranks countries on a scale of one to ten. Kim Jong-il's homeland made its index debut this year with a score of one. Capital punishment North Korea ranks third for meting out the death penalty, behind China and Iran, according to Amnesty International's death penalty statistics. 60 people were executed there in 2010. Military strength According to the IISS Military Balance 2011, North Korea has 1.19 million people on active duty (1.02 million army personnel, 60,000 navy and 110,000 air), plus 189,000 active paramilitary personnel, and a further 600,000 reservists. 5.7 million North Koreans are reservists in the worker/peasant red guard, which is compulsory to the age of 60. Nuclear capability North Korea is a nuclear power, but only has two nuclear warheads (2009 est.), lagging far behind the world's other atomic powers. According to 2009 research by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Russia has nearly 13,000, the US 9,500 and the UK 192. North Korea v South Korea Between 1958 and 2010 there were around 150 incidents between North Korea and South Korea (that we know about). The Datablog mapped them in 2010. Poverty North Korea scored 19.4 on the 2010 Global Hunger Index, a level classed as alarming by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The situation has worsened since 1990, when the country scored 16.2. The proportion of the population that is undernourished has risen from 21% to 32% in that time. Peace North Korea ranks 149th on the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace's Global Peace Index 2011, with a score of 3.09. Only Somalia, Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan are less peaceful. Carbon dioxide emissions North Korea ranks 44th on the world carbon emissions index (using 2009 figures from the Energy Information Administration), with a CO2 emissions level of 79.55m tonnes (3.51 tonnes per capita). That's an increase of 14.3% year on year, the 14th highest (a rapid increase is an indicator of economic growth). Football The North Korean football team scored one goal in the 2010 World Cup (though that was against Brazil), conceded 12 goals and received two yellow cards. They didn't make it beyond the group stage. World government data • Search the world's government with our gateway Can you do something with this data?

The case is being brought in the name of Louise Bowen-West on behalf of the King's Cliffe community near Peterborough against secretary of state for communities and local government, Eric Pickles. The minister ruled in May in favour of a plan drawn up by waste management company, Augean, to allow 250,000 tonnes of nuclear materials to be placed in the East Northamptonshire Resource Management Facility. He argued the \"risk of actual harm from the development would be very low\" but the villagers have brought in Richard Buxton, a Cambridge law firm that specialises in environmental and public law. \"Obviously the wider background is that the government is desperate to get this cheap dumping going ahead of the next lot of nuclear power stations coming online,\" said Clare Langan, a local villager and member of the King's Cliffe Waste Watchers campaign group. Augean said it was unable to comment before the court hearing but sources close to the company said it remained quietly confident that the secretary of state had a robust case. \"It is being brought on a very narrow point of law – that the environmental impact assessment was not properly undertaken because it concentrated on the area where the waste is to be put,\" said one source. Critics say the government wants to rush through the Augean plans aware that the the UK's only purpose-built low level waste repositary at Drigg in Cumbria is rapidly filling up. The residents of King's Cliffe say it is unfair that their village would be the first to take radioactive material from the nuclear industry given they are 90 miles away from any power stations. They claim an underground water source runs from below the landfill site and that a number of springs, pools and streams in the village – mentioned in the Domesday Book – could be contaminated. Augean in the past has insisted that the kind of radioactive waste to be put into the Northamptonshire site will be extremely low level such as rubble from buildings at places such as Harwell in Oxfordshire, Britain's first atomic energy research establishment. Northamptonshire County Council's development control committee, turned down the original application from Augean but this was turned round on appeal to Pickles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2012/aug/14/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-14T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 17 August 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/aug/14/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/aug/14/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 17 August 2012","bodyText":"I was particularly struck by Clive Stafford Smith's comment about the madness of the justice system (Implacable foe of the death penalty, 3 August). It is something I have pondered, and was brought home to me recently when I was burgled. I came home to a ransacked house and various things stolen, and in no time two detectives and a fingerprint man were busy in my house. Next day a uniformed policeman gave me a number for my insurance company, which in due course replaced the stolen items. Later I was filled in on the identification of the suspect, who will almost certainly get a custodial sentence. I was a little shaky for a few nights afterwards, and a little inconvenienced while waiting for replacements. Consider in comparison the plight of the many children whose parents, including a vast army of absent fathers, have abandoned them for various reasons. These children, almost without exception, grow up feeling unwanted, deserted and maligned, usually at a very young age. And carry, at the very least, what some may call a chip on their shoulders for the rest of their lives. Where is the justice and lawful support for these children? How is it possible that the law works unceasingly to find the cat burglar, but ignores the deserting parents who are, after all, very easy to identify? Why is it not unlawful to abandon your child? Gaynor McGrath Armidale, NSW, Australia More than some can bear Amelia Gentleman's exposé of what goes on at a strip club is, for most of us men, not much of a revelation at all (Too much to bare, 3 August). If you want to get to the real truth, just ask a man that frequents these places. Strip clubs are for men who either can't get sex on their own, have been married for a long time and miss the contact with a different woman or recluses that can't get near a woman. The ugly truth of these clubs is that if the girls want to make money, they have to be willing to prostitute themselves. There is the off-chance that a rookie (a man) will go in and a girl will empty his wallet because he never bothered to ask how much a lap dance is and he keeps asking for another one. Other than that, most clubs are full-service places and the fee is usually $160 for 30 minutes for full service, half that for half-service. It's the ugly truth. A club gets busted, it opens under a new name in a different place – ad nauseam. Maximo Pichardo New York City, US • The 3 August edition of Guardian Weekly runs to 48 pages, of which a full four, including photographs, are devoted to Amelia Gentleman's article about one of London's oldest lap-dancing clubs. Is this some sort of joke on the part of editor Abby Deveney or is the Guardian doing its best to become \"trendy\" in an effort to get away from its starchy image of a serious medium for the intelligentsia? If so, please desist, lest we revolt against having the piss taken out of us even more. Perhaps you have already planned a follow-up article on pole-dancing or massage parlours. The mind boggles. John Orton Lindfield, NSW, Australia • Congratulations on Amelia Gentleman's piece on the London lap-dancing club. It's useful to be reminded that such things – which, as we read it, make high claim to present themselves as respectable – exist. Certainly it is not a unique or even exceptional case of exploitation of women with poor prospects, but it is one case that has pignon sur rue in the centre of London (or western Europe, should you prefer). Marc Jachym Paris, France Threat to peace process Your leader comment is right: having come so far restoring peace after decades of brutal and often atrocious armed struggle on all sides, there is indeed a risk that an \"alienated and dispossessed youth\" in Northern Ireland could \"too easily become a recruiting ground for terror\" in a climate of recession and spending cuts (Keep focused, 3 August). The trouble is that these economic hardships are hitting hard just as the healing process is getting into its stride there. A decade back hopes were high that a better state was at last being created for young people in the north and the mood on this was buoyant. Certainly that was how Martin McGuinness, then education minister in the new power-sharing arrangement, put it to me in Adelaide in 2000. \"Young people,\" he said, had \"come through 30 very bitter years of conflict and this [was] bound to take its toll on them\". He continued: \"Undoubtedly that leads to a sense of insecurity about the political situation and nervousness about it, which is bound to have a detrimental effect in every aspect of their lives. The question now is how we can make politics work and show young people that politics can work for them so that they can place some faith in the democratic process.\" \"These young people,\" McGuinness said, \"have been given hope [by the peace process] and they've never had that before.\" It is this generational recovery – one that has continued strongly throughout the last decade or so – that is now being menaced by recession and cutbacks. While this threat remains, a peace process that is progressing well is being undermined and its ultimate success cannot be taken for granted. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Clientelismo in Sicily Reading Tom Kington's report on Sicily's economic reality was a depressing experience (Fears grow for Sicily as bankruptcy looms, 27 July). Kington compares Sicily's bloated civil service (one full-time office staff for every 239 inhabitants) to Lombardy's more reasonable one to 2,500 ratio and points to clientelismo politics as the root cause. Two decades ago, following a 20-year study of Italy's regional government institutions, Robert D Putnam published Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Putnam found that, in the north, for \"at least 10 centuries\" a multitude of societies, guilds, mutual aid societies, co-operatives and unions fostered \"norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement\" resulting in horizontal political relationships. By contrast, Italy's southern regions evolved in the opposite direction, entrenching vertical political relationships. Putnam defines horizontal to mean \"I'll do this for you now, knowing that somewhere down the road you'll do something for me\" and vertical to mean \"I'll do this for you now, if you do that for me now\" – Kington's clientelismo. Vertical politics, clientelismo, is today's dominant ideology. It is more likely that those who would fix Sicily's problems will achieve little more than to install new clientelismo beneficiaries. André Carrel Terrace, British Columbia, Canada Caught in drugs crossfire What steps is the US government taking to reduce the number of drug users in the US? (Ordinary Hondurans get caught up in the crossfire of US war on drugs, 27 July). Logic suggests that a reduction in the demand would eliminate some suppliers. When a supplier is eliminated, but demand remains constant, the price of the narcotic rises and makes it more profitable for the remaining suppliers. Eliminating the demand would eliminate the employment of those tracking down suppliers, which provides a lifetime occupation for the tracker. Is that the purpose of their actions? Because the demand is not reduced. Of course, eliminating US demand might save the lives of innocent citizens of Honduras, and maybe even some in Mexico. David Cowan Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Advertising as comment I read The classics: with hot bits (27 July) with dismay. Not because someone has written erotic additions for the classics – that is predictable in today's oversexualised society – but because the Guardian printed what amounts to an advertisement for the publisher as \"comment\". Permitting the selling of a product so thinly disguised is something I am saddened to see. The statement \"Clandestine Classics, risque remakes of classics including Jane Eyre...\" names the company. Claims such as \"The erotic romance titles that I publish are read by an overwhelmingly female audience …\" make me blush for my gender and your paper. The explanation of the difference in response to the erotic by men and women that might pass muster in a high school essay, but not in the Guardian. Comment is free is always the mantra under the title and author's name in Comment &amp; Debate. This was neither comment nor debate: so it would appear advertising is also free, at least in this instance, on this page. As a reader of many years, I am saddened and disgusted. Rosemary Ommer Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada Briefly • I am rather surprised that the UK should be worried about extending nuclear power through EDF and all because of the change in government in France to \"pale-pink socialism\" (27 July).

A central figure of the LSD-infused counterculture in 60s California, he put on the Trips festival starring the Grateful Dead, while his Whole Earth Catalog – a shopping directory for hippies of clothes, books, tools, seeds and other things useful for a sustainable lifestyle – sold millions, with the slogan \"We are as gods, so we might as well get good at it.\" Brand also co-founded one of the earliest online communities – the WELL – in 1985. But while he describes himself as an avowed environmentalist, his latest book – Whole Earth Discipline – is controversial among greens, suggesting civilisation will be saved from global warming by densely populated cities, nuclear energy, genetically modified food and planet-wide geoengineering. The vision you set out to save human civilisation from climate change is likely to be anathema to many environmentalists. What led you to this point? Several things. Transgenic crops, because I trained as a biologist half a century ago, have never been a particularly great worry to me. And as I looked into the damage caused by the environmental resistance to GM... that became a subject in the book. There's so much going on in biology, biotechnology, synthetic biology and so on that puts a lot of ancient issues into perspective. I want to prepare the way, not to make the same mistakes in the future that I think we have done in the past about biotech and environmentalism. Nuclear was a switch. I had been somewhat against it. I'm so strongly for it now that even if climate change wasn't an issue, I'd still be pushing it. What made you change your mind? Primarily climate. Nuclear produces almost zero greenhouse gas. Coal is the principal villain right now. We'd looked at it mainly in terms of what it did to the landscape, in the States especially, where we've turned the Appalachian mountain ranges upside down and dumped the tops in the creeks. That's been a strong green issue for a long time, and needs to be even stronger. But we hadn't really looked at the waste stream coming out of coal, especially compared with the waste stream coming out of nuclear. And that contrast is what started to drive me to look more closely at nuclear and realise that I had been misled on many of the specifics. As for cities... at least in the US, greens had been leaning towards pushing what they call compactness in cities for a while, mainly as a counter to trying to fight sprawl. It's not a big jump for them to go another step and realise that dense cities are actually good across the board. Geoengineering is interesting. I was at a meeting in Washington DC yesterday with state department and Congress people and whatnot as well as environmentalists. And one strong research initiative under way now includes the Environmental Defence Fund as one of the participants. Well, that's amazing – [the idea] that environmentalists are either non-committal about geoengineering or trying to participate in the early discussions about it. The knee jerk \"Don't mess around with mother nature\" response is not there. Why is that? Time has passed. Environmentalists have been thinking about global warming for longer than most and so we've got used to the idea that mitigation, cutting back on greenhouse gases, is taking way longer than expected and, in fact, may not occur at all for decades. And therefore there needs to be a plan B. If you go to some kind of climate engineering you don't want to do it half-baked, you want to know what you're doing – and that requires research at scale, which hasn't occurred yet. Isn't humanity's track record with technology the worry? I think actually our track record with technology is pretty good. I want greens in particular – and everybody in general – stepping up to close engagement with technology in all its forms. If technology is forging ahead, I'd love to see everybody concerned about its impact on social and natural systems to get right into the thick of it – to make sure technology opens up more options for doing good things in the future. And because technology moves rapidly that's actually a relatively easy thing to do. Use good tech to undue the harm of bad tech. Is the energy and enthusiasm among environmentalists comparable with what it was in the 60s? Comparable energy and a drastic amount more sophistication and capability. One reason I produced the Whole Earth Catalog was to be of use to hundreds of communes starting up in the States – manned by college dropouts who didn't have the faintest idea how to nail boards together or how to make a garden grow. All those kind of fundamental skills were [covered] in the catalogue. It turned out that not just people in communes were interested, a lot of people were. But those levels of naive ignorance – which we hippies specialised in – have passed. We can still party and the people who wanted to party that way are getting better at it. But the people who wanted to reinvent the tools of civilisation... they have gotten drastically better at that. I noticed that you refer to environmentalists as other people. Do you consider yourself an environmentalist? Absolutely balls to the wall and pedal to the metal.

No prizes for guessing who the senior figure is: George \"Goldfinger\" Osborne. I wholeheartedly agree with Goldsmith, a Conservative MP and former environment adviser to David Cameron. After Osborne's gratuitous trash talk on the environment in his Autumn statement, I wrote: \"Words matter. Osborne says burn, baby, burn. The only words that can douse these flames are from the prime minister. Speak now, David Cameron, or you will forever regret your silence.\" I even wrote Cameron a green speech - no charge. As it happens, the Prime minister did break his habitual silence on green matters on Friday, albeit briefly. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the impact of investing in sustainable energy on bills, he said: \"We have to take a long term view, it's not just about taking carbon out of the economy, it's about making sure we are not over-reliant on one source of energy. So there is a massive re-investment that has to take place in our energy industries, we have to replace the nuclear power stations, we need to have more renenewable energies, we need to diversify. There's an investment that needs to take place, so there's a cost associated with that investment.\" Sensible stuff, most would agree. He then mentioned the over-hasty slashing of solar power subsidies. \"But we have taken action for instance on the solar issue where there were excessive costs going being added to people's bills. We had to take action on that and so we did. \" All agree the subsidies have to fall, but \"excessive\" to Cameron apparently means a few pounds or tens of pounds a year for each homeowner in exchange for clean, secure energy. Cameron also talked about rebalancing the economy away from government spending, excessive borrowing and the financial sector towards business, manufacturing and \"making things again\". That is a perfect description of the green economy, which already employs more people than teaching. Cameron gets it. I know, for example, that he has had the major wind turbine manufacturers around the cabinet table, hoping they will build their plants in the UK. But he won't talk about it and even allows Osborne to utter far-from-casual remarks revealing the Chancellor's mistaken belief that green and growth cannot go together. So when Goldsmith chides green campaigners for never giving the coalition government due credit for the good policies that I acknowledge they have delivered, I'd argue he is missing the point. Praise might make Chris Huhne, Greg Barker and others feel a little better, and they would deserve it. But it will do nothing the solve the fundamental problem which is that Osborne, the man in charge of the world's seventh biggest economy, doesn't believe in green growth. The scale of the challenge is huge. The UK needs to replace its creaky energy system with one fit for the future, while cutting carbon emissions to tackle global warming. But the opportunity for the UK is huge too: to be a leading player in the low-carbon economy that will dominate this century. Winning the argument over the green economy is the fundamental issue and campaigners will not help in achieving that by appearing content with a silent prime minister and an openly hostile chancellor.

Keith MacLean, head of policy at Scottish and Southern Energy, the utility leading the charge, told the Guardian: \"These proposals are too complex – they are unworkable, and they are looking more and more like a train wreck.\" He predicted that households would suffer as a result: \"This will expose consumers even more to price volatility. It's taking the risk of volatility away from the generators, who are best equipped to deal with it, and passing it on to consumers.\" Nuclear power, by contrast, is likely to benefit from the reforms, because investors are demanding subsidies and other forms of support from the government if they are to back plans for new reactors, which will cost billions. The government has repeatedly denied that its plans – which would apply to all forms of low-carbon power – represent a subsidy to reactors. \"The only logic we can see in this is that they [ministers] are still trying desperately to hide the nuclear support. They seem to be prepared to make life more difficult for renewables in a last-ditch effort to keep the nuclear option open,\" said MacLean. The group of companies – which include SSE, Ecotricity, Good Energy, Renewable Energy Systems, Natural Power and Fred Olsen Renewables – are urging the energy secretary, the Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, to make major changes to the policy. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The white paper we published in July 2011, which followed the consultation published in December 2010, set out our conclusions that the contracts for difference (CfDs) will provide the most efficient long-term support for all forms of low carbon generation. The CfD controls costs for consumers, provides stable returns for investors, and maintains the market incentives to generate when electricity demand is high.\" Electricity market reform is the cornerstone of the coalition's energy policy, flagged up in last week's Queen's speech. It was billed by the government as necessary to \"ensure secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity\". At the heart of the reforms are a new form of energy supply management known as \"contracts for difference\". These will be long-term contracts among low-carbon electricity generators, grid operators and energy retailers that will guarantee a supply of power at a certain price. That price could be higher than wholesale electricity prices, but may end up being lower than generators could sell their power for on the open market – the attraction is supposed to be the long-term guaranteed price. Many details of how the contracts will work have still not been laid out, including the likely prices, the length of time the agreements will be allowed to run, and what will happen if electricity prices rise to be far higher than the contract price. The new contracts are likely to be highly complex, however, and it will be difficult for generators and their financial backers to judge the likely returns and build business plans. This in turn will also make it harder for new entrants to gain finance. \"It seems quite bizarre that this is being put forward as encouraging new entrants, when it makes it far more risky and expensive – it raises the barriers to entry,\" said MacLean. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said: \"Contracts for difference, which are essentially a subsidy for new nuclear, could put small suppliers out of business and kill the independent market. This risk does not exist under the current Renewables Obligation.\" In place of these reforms, many renewable companies would prefer the government to extend the system of subsidies – called feed-in tariffs – that supports domestic renewables, and make them available to large-scale installations such as windfarms. Feed-in tariffs guarantee a price for electricity as it is generated, at a premium over the wholesale price, and are widely used in countries such as Germany that have successfully built renewable energy infrastructure. By contrast, the contracts could provide a perverse incentive, according to MacLean, to generate at times when the electricity is less needed. There are also concerns over a potential hiatus in investment as the current subsidy system is replaced. New renewable installations, such as offshore windfarms, will continue to qualify for the current system – the renewable obligation, by which renewable generators receive certificates that they sell, in addition to the money they receive for their power – if they come onstream by 2017, and their subsidies under that scheme carry on until 2037. The first new contracts should be ready to come into force by 2017, so that in theory there should be no gap. Under the reforms, however, generators must apply for contracts for difference before their turbines are built, and this can take several years in the case of big offshore windfarms. That means developers must begin to apply for the new system soon, at the risk they would have been better off under the current system. MacLean said investment in offshore windfarms was already becoming more difficult. Several offshore wind turbine manufacturers recently told the Guardian they were waiting for details from the government on how the reforms would work in practice. General Electric said its investment, which could run to more than £100m, was \"on hold\" until the full plans were laid out. Green campaigners are also concerned about the impact of the proposed reforms. Paul Steedman, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Contracts for difference are bad news for renewable energy. We're moving from one highly complex system – the renewable obligation – to something even more fiendishly complex.\" He said the aim of policy should be to encourage more renewable generators into the market, especially smaller players. For instance, he said, if local councils were to engage in developing renewable resources, it could lead to a massive expansion and lower bills for consumers, who would be less dependent on expensive imported gas. \"That's what we'd like to see – but these reforms will go in the opposite direction.\" Steedman said there was still time for the coalition to change its plans. The current proposals were drawn up before Davey took over from former minister Chris Huhne earlier this year. \"We and many others will be urging them to look again,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/23/nuclearpower-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Fukushima fears chill Obama's atomic ambition | Eric Augenbraun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/23/nuclearpower-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/23/nuclearpower-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima fears chill Obama's atomic ambition","bodyText":"The recent tsunami in Japan and the subsequent, ongoing crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant have prompted concerns that a similar series of events could occur in the United States. After all, there is no country on earth more familiar with nuclear power than the United States: its 104 commercial plants make it the world's largest provider of nuclear power. Yet, for an industry with such well-documented risks – albeit risks that have laid dormant for more than a decade – nuclear energy has enjoyed a great deal of support from the Obama administration. Obama's endorsements of alternative, renewable energy have always been qualified by his inclusion of nuclear power \"in the mix\". Even with the most recent news that heightened levels of radioactive iodine have been detected in Tokyo's water supply, Obama has followed the US nuclear industry's cues, insisting that we have nothing to fear and that nuclear power remains a key to our energy future. How are we to make sense of this seemingly unshakeable commitment? By insisting that the Fukushima crisis is simply an unfortunate result of the tsunami rather than the seismic activity in the region, the US nuclear industry hopes to quell potentially costly anxieties that such an event could happen here – or that nuclear energy might be fundamentally hazardous. For instance, Exelon, the country's largest operator of nuclear plants, issued a statement on 13 March in which they declared that \"[o]ur plants are safe, particularly given the different seismic patterns in our regions and the absence of tsunami-type events where we have operations.\" Technically, this is true. Exelon does not operate either the Diablo Canyon or the San Onofre facilities – California's two nuclear plants that remain active and have been found to be on or near active geographic faults. Exelon does, however, operate the Oyster Creek plant in Ocean County, New Jersey, which houses a General Electric boiling water reactor – the same basic design of two of the three damaged reactors in the Fukushima plant. While eastern New Jersey is not typically thought of as at-risk for earthquakes or tsunamis, there are other fears. \"Of course we don't get tsunamis, we don't get earthquakes, but we do get hurricanes,\" says Norm Cohen of Unplug Salem, a group opposing nuclear energy in New Jersey. \"[…] I can imagine a scenario where you have a category five hurricane and just a big wall of water in front of it, and I don't think we're prepared for that.\" Moreover, other energy companies do operate facilities that might be susceptible to earthquakes. The Diablo Canyon reactor sits less than a mile from the recently discovered \"shoreline fault\", which scientists are currently studying to ascertain the potential hazard it might pose to the facility. According to state senator Sam Blakeslee, who holds a doctorate in earthquake studies, the fault's proximity to the plant could \"produce shaking far in excess of what's expected\". Another fear is that the shoreline fault and another intersecting fault could begin moving at the same time, resulting in an even more intense quake. A 2010 report by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that the same Diablo Canyon facility had operated for a year and a half with some emergency systems disabled. And, of course, a nuclear plant need not be susceptible to natural disasters to pose a public safety hazard. In addition to numerous smaller incidents, the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island facility (now operated by Exelon) in 1979 and the catastrophic meltdown at Chernobyl in 1986 remain two of the starkest reminders of the inherent dangers of nuclear energy. Both were caused by a combination of mechanical failures and human error. From a business perspective, it is perfectly understandable that the nuclear industry would feel the need to assuage public fears in the wake of the Fukushima crisis. Since the late 1970s, the industry has largely been in a state of stagnation; the tide of US public opinion began to turn against nuclear power following the near disaster at Three Mile Island. Of the 104 plants currently in operation, ground was broken on all of them before 1974. To expand its business, the industry turned to exports, finding a friend in President Bill Clinton, who approved the sale of nuclear technology to such countries as China, Brazil and Argentina. More recently, Barack Obama has proven nothing short of a godsend for the nuclear industry in the US. Along with clean, renewable energy sources, Obama has long considered nuclear power an important alternative to coal and other dirty, foreign fossil fuels. In the Democratic debate during the 2008 presidential race, he made his position clear: \"I actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix.\" Even as he has acknowledged that \"nothing is completely failsafe\" in the midst of the Fukushima crisis, he has remained steadfast in his support of nuclear energy. As recently as 17 March, he stated, \"Nuclear energy is an important part of our own energy future.\" While it was George W Bush who established $18.5bn in federal loan guarantees for the construction of new plants, it is Obama who declared his intentions to nearly triple that figure to $54.5bn. To understand President Obama's commitment to nuclear energy, one need look no further than his Illinois roots. Home of the Exelon Corporation, the state could aptly be described as the nuclear energy capital of the United States. It hosts 11 reactors at six different sites – the most in the country. As the New York Times reports, since 2003, employees and executives of Exelon have donated at least $227,000 to Obama's senate and presidential campaigns. Additionally, David Axelrod, Obama's chief political adviser, has previously served as a consultant for Exelon. In 2006, a dispute between Illinois voters and the state nuclear industry forced then Senator Obama to step in to mediate a dispute between the two constituencies. When Illinois residents raised concerns that Exelon had failed to report a leak at one of its facilities, Obama drafted a bill that would have forced energy companies to report all leaks immediately. Ultimately, however, he presented much weaker legislation. \"Senator Obama's staff was sending us copies of the bill to review, and we could see it weakening with each successive draft,\" said Joe Cosgrove, a park district director in Will County, Illinois, where low-level radioactive runoff had turned up in groundwater. \"The teeth were just taken out of it.\" The new bill did not include language mandating prompt reporting of leaks. In addition to the inherent risks of nuclear energy production, the safe disposal of radioactive waste remains a serious problem; and like fossil fuels, the world's supply of uranium-235 and plutonium-239 is limited. Given these realities, it would not be a leap to conclude that Obama's insistence on including nuclear power in the discussion of clean and renewable forms of energy has more to do with his backing by the nuclear power industry than anything else. This position may not be tenable for long, however. While early signs indicate that President Obama's support for nuclear energy will endure the crisis in Japan, it is much more likely that public opinion will not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jan/05/iran-nuclear-fuel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-05T11:14:00Z","webTitle":"Iran's first nuclear fuel rod and what it means","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jan/05/iran-nuclear-fuel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/jan/05/iran-nuclear-fuel","fields":{"headline":"Iran's first nuclear fuel rod and what it means","bodyText":"Olli Heinonen, a former IAEA deputy director general and head of the safeguards department (ie chief inspector), has some thoughts about Iran's claim to have manufactured and tested its first uranium fuel rod. This is his guest blog. In the past few days, at a time of high tension in the Gulf, Iran announced that it had produced and tested its first fuel rod at the Tehran Research Reactor. It also claimed to have mastered the production of nuclear plates. My understanding is that what is being tested at the TRR is a rod designed to be used at the heavy water reactor under construction in Arak. Making assemblies of plates of the kind required to fuel the TRR itself is still some way off. Iran has always stated that the TRR is being used to produce radioisotopes through irradiation for industrial and medical purposes. To operate, the reactor needs a core made of fuel assemblies, which contain a total of 30 kg uranium enriched to 20 % U-235. Each fuel assembly is made of thin plates, which contain uranium in form of U3O8 (uranium oxide) in aluminium cladding. It appears from the announcement that what Iran has produced and tested at the hot cells at the TRR is something different: a fuel rod, which typically consists of cylindrical pellets clad in a zirconium tube. The rod Iran claims to have made contains natural uranium, suggesting that it is intended for the IR-40 heavy water reactor at Arak, rather than for a light water nuclear power station like Bushehr, which uses rods of low enriched U-235. This is a cause for concern as such an action is proscribed by the United Nations Security Council due to its proliferation concerns. Plutonium could be separated from the reactor's spent fuel. Hence this show of ostensibly civilian nuclear progress could end up further stoking international tensions. Some of the Iranian news articles claim it is easy to manufacture a fuel plate after making a fuel rod. However, manufacturing processes for rods and plates are very different, each with its own challenges, and making a plate using homogeneous 20 % enriched uranium will not be straightforward. Iran has yet to demonstrate it can do this. If everything proceeds as planned, the first real fuel assemblies can be introduced to the reactor some time next year. That is when current stocks of TRR fuel are due to run out. The fact that Iran is still a year away from actual production of the first fuel assembly for the TRR provides an opportunity for the P5+1 to negotiate a more comprehensive solution to address the increasing stockpiles of 3.5 % and 20 % enriched uranium. Iran's current stock of 20 % enriched uranium should be sufficient to provide fuel for next 4-5 years for the TRR. And there is no need for Iran to produce more 20 % enriched uranium. Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili has recently asked to re-launch nuclear talks with the P5+1. What could the P5+1 offer which Iran currently does not have, and what Iran could give in return? Here's a thought: The P5+1 could provide modern, safe and secure nuclear technology, fuel for the TRR and in the longer term, a more efficient research reactor. Iran could in turn relinquish its stock of enriched uranium. Iran and the P5+1 should also convert Iran's IR-40 heavy water reactor under construction in Arak to a more proliferation-proof light water research reactor. Such a reactor could use current 3.5 % enriched uranium stock as fuel material, an approach which has recently been demonstrated to be feasible.

The environmental movement needs to change. The world is radically different than it was in the 1960's and 1970's when the modern movement was formed. The environmental movement needs to mature its view of the role of people, technology and corporations. People are the solution not the problem. Technology and innovation allows us to survive on a resource-limited planet. Big corporations are not always the enemy. But the filmmakers of \"What the Green Movement Got Wrong\", in their exuberance to make their point, blamed environmentalists for starvation in Africa and energy scarcity throughout the world. That blame is misplaced. Of all those at fault for drought and food shortage in Zambia, environmentalists rank low on the list. The environmental community has been too short on solutions, but to view the environmental movement as a shadow government is to badly misread reality. Indeed, environmental groups have raised the alarm about food and energy scarcity. To blame environmentalists for the problems they identify is like blaming women for misogyny. My mentor David Brower, a legendary American environmentalist, liked to say that \"politicians are like weather veins and our job is to make the wind blow.\" Environmentalists attempt to move public opinion, they don't set public policy. The environmental community can hardly be blamed for the lack of transparency in the nuclear and biotech industry that has been at the heart of public concern. That I and other lifelong greens have critiques of the environmental movement is no secret; in 2004 I gave a widely-circulated speech entitled \"Is Environmentalism Dead?\" But as I shared with the filmmakers in footage not selected for broadcast, I am and have always been a passionate supporter of the very groups I criticize. They have been the thin green line that has blocked short-sighted politicians and corporations from turning our last wild forests into toilet paper, our last whales into sushi, our atmosphere into an open sewer. While I have disagreements with Stewart Brand, I have always respected him and I'm the first in line to say that the environmental movement needs to review its most sacred beliefs. But this film misses the mark. George Monbiot, Guardian columnist and author of Heat Stewart Brand ends the documentary by demanding that we set aside the joys of ideology and romanticism. But this is one of the most romantic and ideological films I've ever seen. It expresses the profoundly romantic belief that technology alone can solve political and economic problems, and suggests that we needn't make hard choices, such as restraining consumer demand. The idea that wealth and power don't have to be confronted to protect the environment and to ensure that everyone is fed is deeply ideological. It's a convenient ideology - if you're trying to rub along well with corporations and governments. Brand's approach, which the film is based on, is not so much a new form of environmentalism as a new form of corporate consultancy: he appears to be seeking to shape the environmental debate to suit the businesses he works for. Tim Flannery, author of The Weather-Makers and chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council What the Green Movement Got Wrong' posits that the anti-nuclear and anti-GM crops stance taken by some environmentalists has been counter-productive. This is, in my view, very much a debate the environment movement needs to have. Far less positive it its inference that environmentalists have dealt with climate change in a counter-productive way. This assertion is poorly based, and moreover lets the climate sceptics, who are really to blame for our slowness to action, off scott-free. One of the program's greatest weaknesses is that it uses the terms 'greens' and 'environmentalists' so as to smear the entire movement with the perceived sins of a few. While regrettable and lazy, it would be a pity to toss the baby out with the bathwater. I hope that all concerned with the environment use the issues raised in the program to think more deeply about what a sustainable future might look like. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace As a scientist working for an environmental group, the documentary's proposition that we are anti-science and ideological is simply not one I recognise. The reality is we're pro-science and very pragmatic. Our biggest campaign on climate change would not exist if we didn't hold science in high regard. Our pragmatism in delivering real change means some surprising alliances. We worked with McDonalds on stopping Amazon deforestation and with Coca-Cola on greener refrigeration to protect the ozone layer and prevent climate change. We don't share all the values of these corporations but are pragmatic enough to realise what working with them could deliver. Because of that very pragmatism we've been accused of abandoning our values– so to now be accused of being ideological is bizarre. We are also not ideologicaly or dogmatically opposed to nuclear and GM technologies. We've looked at what they can do and see better alternatives – we believe GM and nuclear would institutionally block those better alternatives from blossoming. But if the evidence changes then so will our position. Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation If you suggest that it is better to mend a bicycle with a spanner than a fish, does that make you anti fish? Brand and Lynas try to label environmentalists as anti-science and anti-progress. But both they, and the corporate lobbies promoting GM food and nuclear power, fail to acknowledge that the green movement is merely in favour of different applications of science, ones they conclude are more likely to deliver better progress. The question should be, which tool is best for the job? Who holds the fish, and who the spanner? Brand and Lynas are waving fish. A wide range of agro-ecological farming methods coupled with land reform and economic support to small farmers are more proven, more productive and more likely to reliably feed the poor than GM. And, numerous, quicker, cheaper, safer and more efficient climate friendly energy strategies and technologies than nuclear are available. The programme had an oddly emotive pitch. Whilst shrouding itself in science, it displayed a very unscientific faith in particular technologies. Considering the multiple other solutions on offer for human hunger and climate change, the curious, unsettling question, left unanswered, is why do GM food and nuclear power get such disproportionate attention? Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth's director of policy and campaigns Last night's Channel 4 documentary was supposed to reveal a radical new approach to saving the planet. But, like the companies peddling the GM and nuclear technologies the programme pushed, it promised much and delivered little. There's nothing new about GM and nuclear. Both have been around for decades, both are expensive and ineffective and both are distractions. The documentary urged us to engage with technology, science and people to deliver the solutions that are so urgently needed. But this is precisely the approach that Friends of the Earth has followed for years – focussing on driving the right kinds of changes and winning campaigns that make a real difference on the ground. After all, it's because of the people who took action with us that the UK has the world's first climate change law, requiring emissions cuts in line with what scientists say is needed. [More from Friends of the Earth] Zachary Makanya of PELUM-Kenya and chair of African Biodiversity Network What the Green Movement Got Wrong\" was an insult to the very people it purports to care about. The programme did not include Southern farmers' voices, and implied that Africans do not have the intelligence to think for themselves. The ABN is here to dispel that myth and to tell the film's producers that it is they who have failed to understand the real issues.\" Ben Page, chief executive at pollsters Mori IPSOS I think the programme probably posted a false dichotomy between different parts of the green movement, but it is true that those greens who present apocalyptic visions of temperature feedback loops have the effect of reinforcing the views of the many who tend to view global warming as like death and taxes: inevitable but unpleasant and therefore better not to think about. However it is not the green movement's positioning per se that is behind the decline in concern about climate change of the last few years (those who think it is happening are down from 91% to 78%): but the media giving disproportionate coverage to the tiny minority of scientists who disagree with it, and a very cold winter, that are more to blame. My personal position is that we need both technology and considerable changes in consumption to cope with it: it is only by avoiding extreme positions (as the public would see them) that one can take people with you. Michael Buick, director of emissions trading campaigners Sandbag Luckily the documentary was not a loud \"Ha-ha! Green crazies admit they were wrong\", as it could easily have been given C4's patchy record on environmental issues, and the anti-Greens amazing ability to turn the facts on their head. The diverse and eclectic 'Green movement' can name some of the century's most passionate, selfless and ultimately foresighted people amongst its ranks. As the documentary showed there have been many successes that we all benefit from. And yes some alarms were sounded without good reason, some perhaps simply too early to be taken seriously. Yet the larger theme of 'What the Greens got wrong' struck a chord. Not about nuclear energy or GM crops, but about the natural bias towards the 'No' word, the puritanical streak and misanthropy found too often in our ranks. We need whistleblowers, and the 'Greens' have had many. But we also need entrepreneurs. After the 'not this way' MUST come a 'here's a better option'... The instinctive 'no' of the green movement has been on clear display when it comes to emissions trading. The idea of using the power of markets to protect the earth's ecology is new, radical and full of problems and pitfalls. But we need bold new ideas to move forward. In a crisis all suggested solutions with real potential should be taken seriously. It is clear that a good number of carbon trading's most passionate opponents get their drive not from a reasoned assessment of the pros and cons, but from a raw dislike of capitalism. They are quite simply cheesed off that a system they object to should find a way to adapt to a problem of (perhaps largely) its own making. Shouldn't it rather throw it's hands up 'mea culpa' and humbly beat a retreat? [More from Sandbag] Professor Howard Atkinson, plant scientist at the University of Leeds By 2030, our warming world will have 50% more mouths to feed. To avoid a food crisis without stripping the planet of water and nutrients we have to come up with solutions soon. Redistribution of wealth and food is vital, but might not be possible in the time available. No one is advocating GM as a magic bullet against world hunger, but to reject the contribution of this technology before we even know what it is capable of would be morally wrong. If science can develop nutrient-enriched rice or drought tolerant maize, how can we justify its dismissal on ideological grounds? A reliable, sustainable food supply is the common goal of both plant scientists and the green movement; climate change and a growing population are our common concerns. We cannot afford the luxury of fighting over individual technologies such as GM; to succeed we must work together with every tool at our disposal. Let us do the research.

Describing the plant as a symbol of Iranian resistance, Salehi added: \"Despite all pressure, sanctions and hardships imposed by western nations, we are now witnessing the start-up of the largest symbol of Iran's peaceful nuclear activities.\" The first truckload of fuel was taken today from a storage site to a fuel pool inside the reactor building under the watch of monitors from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency.

It will be another two months before the 1,000-megawatt, light water reactor begins supplying electricity to Iranian cities. Russia, which helped finish building the plant, has pledged to safeguard the site and prevent spent nuclear fuel from being used to make nuclear weapons. Moscow believes the Bushehr project is essential in persuading Iran to cooperate with international efforts to ensure it does not develop nuclear arms. Washington disagrees, arguing that Iran should not be rewarded while it continues to defy UN demands to halt the enrichment of uranium, a process used to produce fuel for power plants but which can also be used in weapons production. The Bushehr plant poses little proliferation risk since Russia is supplying the enriched uranium for the reactor and will take away spent fuel that could be used to make weapons-grade plutonium.

It can contaminate food and water and, if ingested, gets distributed around the body, where it builds up in soft tissues, such as muscles. It has a half-life of about 30 years, meaning it takes that long for its radioactivity to fall by half. Over time, it is expelled from the body in urine. Iodine-131, if inhaled or swallowed, will concentrate in the thyroid gland where it can accumulate and cause cancer within a few years. Low doses can reduce the activity of the gland, and make it produce lower levels of hormones. The threat is more serious in children, who have more active thyroids. Officials have distributed potassium iodide pills to people in the exclusion zone around the plant as a prophylactic.; the pills saturate the thyroid with normal iodine, so it cannot absorb as much of the radioactive form.

That was clearly rankling two leading industry executives, Thomas Dinwoodie and Daniel Shugar, who were touring Washington and New York this week to argue that the cost of solar power had come down enough to make it competitive with nuclear power, new natural gas plants, even new coal plants. \"It has already happened. Solar is competitive,\" Dinwoodie, the founder of SunPower, the second largest US solar company, told a discussion hosted by the New America Foundation. Solar costs have fallen sharply in the last few years, because of increased production and technological advances. \"Solar is ramping down in cost where it is competitive with all these other forms of energy,\" Dinwoodie said. He said the cost of solar power, currently 13.9 cents a kilowatt hour, would fall to 7 cents a kilowatt hour by 2020, according to the department of energy. That would put solar prices in the range, or even cheaper, than conventional energy sources, he said. That's encouraging news for an industry that has struggled to establish itself in the US, where solar power technology was developed half a century ago. Even after the Fukushima disaster, the industry is still fighting for space against nuclear power, which has strong support from the Obama Administration. It is also competing against a natural gas boom. Not that solar power has been entirely forgotten in the Obama Administration's clean energy push. Federal government subsidies cover up to 30% of the cost of new projects. California, meanwhile, is aiming to get a third of its electricity from renewable power. Those incentives have helped spread solar panels across the rooftops of the south-west and beyond, to north-eastern states like New Jersey. Big box retailers like Wal-Mart have also put solar panels on their rooftops. But there is growing opposition to the idea of solar super projects, especially in fragile desert landscapes. In one of the most contentious cases, BrightSource Energy has been forced to hire up to 100 biologists to protect a rare species of desert tortoise from its enormous project in the Mojave Desert. Solar power might be coming of age, but there are still plenty of growing pains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/feb/13/sanctioning-silence-iran-west","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-13T09:14:32Z","webTitle":"Sanctioning in silence is costing the west goodwill on Iran's streets | Azadeh Moaveni","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/13/sanctioning-silence-iran-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/13/sanctioning-silence-iran-west","fields":{"headline":"Sanctioning in silence is costing the west goodwill on Iran's streets","bodyText":"Daily life in Iran has never been such a grind. In just the past month, the price of milk and yoghurt has jumped, foreign medicines have risen by a third and most brands of cigarettes cost about 20-50% more. Exporters nervous about getting paid are suspending shipments of tea, rice and cooking oil. Iran's middle class is feeling the squeeze; with the country's currency in a tailspin, holidays to favourite spots like Turkey and Thailand are no longer an option. As the prospect of further price increases looms, even moderate Iranians opposed to the government are growing resentful of the west. In the early days of his presidency, Barack Obama was bubbling over with messages for the Iranian people. In comparison, today's silence is deafening. The west has become so involved in its political brinkmanship with the mullahs that it has lost sight of how its actions play out internally in Iran. But public sentiment should not be ignored, as what unfolds in Iran will have as much to do with Iranians as it does with Iranian politicians. The west must outline that sanctions are not designed to target the people of Iran, but Iranian officials and the Revolutionary Guard elite who now control large swaths of the economy. Iranians need to hear that the west is applying sanctions as a means to avoid a worse confrontation, and that humanitarian goods like food and medicines are exempt. Because the majority of Iranians share the government's ambitions to nuclear power, which lay at the heart of these sanctions, the west should clarify how Iran can both pursue its legitimate aims and live up to its commitments to the International Atomic Energy Association. Iranians should be reminded that the government can take steps to extricate itself from this mess and, most importantly, that much awaits them should it choose to. Explaining why Iranians are not on a fast-track to Iraq's fate matters, especially as the west has made it clear that these sanctions are only the beginning. \"We're going to continue to see these kinds of knock-on effects as the pressure tightens, even though the focus is not at all on the people,\" says a senior US official. \"And there's more coming through the pipeline. This pressure is meant to stave off the inclination to go to war, using the strongest possible non-military means to change Iran's behaviour.\" An important case in point is the sanctions targeting Iran's civil aviation industry. Imposed by the US since 1995, these sanctions prohibit the sale of spare aeroplane parts to Iran, whose fleet of decrepit Boeings has suffered regular accidents over the past decade, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths. Iranian officials rail against these sanctions, reminding citizens at every opportunity that the mercenary west cares nothing for their safety. But the reality is not as black and white as Tehran makes out. American law includes provisions allowing Iran to procure spare parts by applying to the US treasury department for a special licence. Under this provision, Iran applies for what it needs through an intermediary and the parts are installed in a licensed third-country, such as by Lufthansa in Germany. Iran has availed itself of this option in the past, and the treasury has issued nearly a dozen special licences related to its civil aircraft, according to a treasury department official. Given that Tehran is pretending this provision doesn't exist and is declining to use it more aggressively, Washington should make the case that Iran is playing its own cynical game. Iranians are a politically savvy people, but their willingness to hold their government accountable for the parlous state of the economy is endangered by the rising costs of sanctions. The west is losing goodwill among the secular-minded Iranians who in 2009 demonstrated in the streets carrying placards asking Obama for his help. The US and its allies in Europe must take to television, and resume their conversation with the Iranian people. Most Iranians watch TV news religiously, and an audience of millions tunes in to satellite broadcasts by BBC Persian and Voice of America's Persian network. BBC Persian is emerging as an especially influential voice among Iranians, and the platform offers an easy means for American and European officials to complement sanctions with public diplomacy. With news quick to reverberate across Iran's voluminous blogosphere, there are myriad ways for Iranians to hear what the west has to say. It is a grim task, explaining to Iranians precisely who is responsible for what share of their suffering, but sanctioning in silence is a terrible alternative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
