But that was in February 2014, when the prime minister was visiting the submerged Somerset Levels. No systematic review of flood protection ever happened. On Sunday, as terrible floods hit Yorkshire and Lancashire, Cameron said: “Whenever these things happen, you should look at what you spend, what you’ve built … clearly we should look again at whether there’s more we can do.” The people living in the 5m properties that are at risk of flooding can only hope he means it this time. For the thousands currently condemned to months away from their ruined homes it is a case of closing the floodgates after the rivers have overflowed. Cameron cannot say he was not warned: he has ignored red flag after red flag, right from the start of his premiership. In the first year of the coalition, he cut capital spending on flood defences by 27% year-on-year. That was despite the 2008 Pitt Review – a systematic analysis of major floods in 2007 – concluding that much more funding was needed. Funding had risen quickly under the Labour government, only to be slashed by Cameron. The prime minister himself had expressed the risks. “Most people accept that, with climate change, [floods] are likely to be more frequent,” he told parliament in May 2008, following flooding in his Oxfordshire constituency. Flood defence spending never recovered to the level inherited from Labour during the whole coalition parliament, if you exclude – as the National Audit Office deems appropriate – the emergency funding delivered after flooding 2013-14. In January 2012, the government’s own research showed increased flooding is the greatest threat posed by climate change in England. But when heavy flooding hit in the summer of 2012, the Guardian revealed that almost 300 proposed flood defences had not gone ahead as planned following the cuts. A £58m scheme in Leeds – one of the cities hit in the latest round of flooding – was one affected project, which would have saved many times its cost in avoided damages. Richard Lewis, a city councillor, said at the time: “The cuts are the economics of the madhouse.” Adapting to climate change, principally flooding, is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But in May 2013, the environment secretary at the time, Owen Paterson, cut the number of officials working on the national adaptation programme from 38 to six. Global warming means more extreme weather, with records increasingly likely to be broken, and the wettest winter for 250 years in 2013-14 caused huge floods across the country. The Guardian revealed at that time that flood-stricken communities, including those visited by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, had been left without planned defences following funding cuts. Other undelivered defences include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Thames Valley also saw flooding, in a region where planned defences had been delayed and downsized. In the midst of these floods, as Cameron promised the review that never happened, the government’s own climate change advisers told ministers there was a £500m hole in their flood defence plans, even to just to keep pace with the rising risk driven by climate change. The shortfall would result in £3bn of damages, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warned. The Met Office then warned in March 2014 that extreme rainfall was becoming more common in the UK. In November 2014, another red flag was raised, in the form of a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO). It found the risk of flooding was indeed rising as a result of government funding cuts. Furthermore, half the nation’s flood defences had been left with “minimal” maintenance, according to the spending watchdog. The NAO also contradicted Cameron’s claim that his government was spending more than ever on flood defences. Funding had fallen by 10% in real terms, said the NAO, when the £270m of one-off emergency funding after the 2013-14 floods was excluded. The NAO noted that this bailout was poor substitute for sustained spending: “Ad hoc emergency spending is less good value than sustained maintenance.” Later in November came the news that local authority flood defence funding would be cut by a third in 2015. “This is dire,” said Paul Cobbing, the chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents community flood action groups. “Lead Local Flood Authorities are at the heart of flood risk management. They are already under-resourced and this puts flood risk management backwards at the very point when a step change forwards is needed.” In June 2015, the CCC recommended that the government should “develop a strategy to address the increasing number of homes in areas of high flood risk”. But in October the government replied: “We believe that a strategy to address future residual risk would not be appropriate at this time.” “The CCC made a very clear recommendation in its statutory advice, but the government rejected it,” Daniel Johns, the CCC’s head of adaptation, said on 9 December. Then came the flooding in Cumbria, where the Guardian revealed that a £4m flood defence scheme for the town of Kendal, which was submerged in up to 5ft of water by Storm Desmond, was repeatedly postponed. Scientists estimated that these floods were made 40% more likely by climate change. The current floods in Yorkshire and Lancashire, with the Army mobilised and the emergency Cobra committee assembling, is the most recent red flag. But it too will sink from view under the rising tide of the UK’s increasing flood risk unless Cameron’s new review delivers a comprehensive and fully funded strategy to combat the UK’s most serious threat from global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/16/masdars-zero-carbon-dream-could-become-worlds-first-green-ghost-town","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-16T13:47:38Z","webTitle":"Masdar's zero-carbon dream could become world’s first green ghost town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/16/masdars-zero-carbon-dream-could-become-worlds-first-green-ghost-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/16/masdars-zero-carbon-dream-could-become-worlds-first-green-ghost-town","fields":{"headline":"Masdar's zero-carbon dream could become world’s first green ghost town","bodyText":"Years from now passing travellers may marvel at the grandeur and the folly of the futuristic landscape on the edges of Abu Dhabi: the barely occupied office blocks, the deserted streets, the vast tracts of undeveloped land and – most of all – the abandoned dream of a zero-carbon city. Masdar City, when it was first conceived a decade ago, was intended to revolutionise thinking about cities and the built environment. Now the world’s first planned sustainable city – the marquee project of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) plan to diversify the economy from fossil fuels - could well be the world’s first green ghost town. As of this year - when Masdar was originally scheduled for completion - managers have given up on the original goal of building the world’s first planned zero-carbon city. Masdar City is nowhere close to zeroing out its greenhouse gas emissions now, even at a fraction of its planned footprint. And it will not reach that goal even if the development ever gets fully built, the authorities admitted. “We are not going to try to shoehorn renewable energy into the city just to justify a definition created within a boundary,” said Chris Wan, the design manager for Masdar City. “As of today, it’s not a net zero future,” he said. “It’s about 50%.” When Masdar City began, in 2006, the project was touted as a model for a green mixed-use urban landscape: a global hub for the cleantech industry, with 50,000 residents and 40,000 commuters. Foster + Partners designed a car-free city scape, with Jetson-style driverless electric cars shuttling passengers between buildings incorporating built-in shades and kitted out with smart technologies to resist the scorching desert heat, and keep cooling costs down. Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment company, pledged financial support to the estimated $22bn experiment in urban design. Ten years on, however, only a fraction of the town has been built - less than 5% of the original six square km “greenprint”, as Wan called it. The completion date has been pushed back to 2030. The core of Masdar City is in place, anchored by the large square-ish building that is the Middle East headquarters of Siemens. A 45-metre Teflon-coated wind tower helps channel cooling breezes down a shaded street equipped with a grocery store, bank, post office, a canteen, and a couple of coffee shops. As many as 300 other firms such as GE’s Ecomagination and Lockheed Martin also have an official presence – though Wan acknowledged that in many cases that just amounts to a hot desk. The International Renewable Energy Agency took over the other major building for its shimmering steel headquarters last year. Irena chose Abu Dhabi as its base, after Masdar promised a state-of-the-art sustainable building. The six-storey headquarters uses only one-third of the energy of comparable office buildings in Abu Dhabi – thanks to air-tight insulation and high-efficiency elevators. The design rejected overhead lamps, to encourage use of natural lighting, and called for solar water heaters on the roof. By UAE standards, both the Siemens and the Irena buildings are state-of-the-art in terms of optimising energy use – but it’s less clear how they stack up globally. The UAE uses its own ratings system which does not readily translate to more familiar green building standards. In addition, the agency’s 90 or so staffers are the only occupants of the six-storey, 32,000m space. Fewer than 2,000 people work on the campus, according to tour guides. Only 300 live on-site, all graduate students of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, who are given free tuition and accommodation. The pioneering autonomous transport system - which was originally supposed to stretch to 100 stations - was scrapped after the first two stops. There is a bike-sharing station – though it’s a good 10 miles away from Abu Dhabi, and there are no bike paths. And the rationale for Masdar City – demonstrating a model of green living – has been abandoned. “The original aim was to be net zero, yes, but that was when we were looking at the city in isolation,” Wan said. He maintained it was important to look at Masdar City within the context of the other renewable energy holdings of the parent company. Among Mubadala’s other holdings, Masdar Clean Energy is developing the Shams solar farm. “Masdar as a family company is supply[ing] much, much more clean energy than what is being consumed in the city, for sure,” Wan said. “All I am saying is that we are not going to use a city line boundary to try to dictate what is the most cost-effective way to produce clean energy, because the money invested in Masdar City and the money invested in Shams is the same source.” He went on: “In the bigger picture I am doing more good for the country and for planet Earth because it’s much more efficient.” Long before the drop in oil prices, the UAE led the oil-producing Gulf countries in moving their economy away from fossil fuels. The country’s leaders, staring at the prospect that their estimated reserves could run out in 50 years, invested in tourism, tech and renewable energy. Today about 70% of GDP comes from non-oil sectors, according to Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE prime minister. The country is eager to be seen as a leader in renewable energy and sustainability, convening regular leadership retreats to discuss their future beyond oil. In January the country’s prime minister tweeted: The UAE spent $20bn on a nuclear power plant, still under construction, projected to produce close to 25% of its electricity by 2020. The country is also building what has been billed as the world’s biggest solar farm in Dubai, and to install rooftop solar on every home in the emirate by 2030. The first 25 families have moved into a net-zero emissions residential neighbourhood in Dubai, with plans for a solar-powered hotel and school. “Whether we are an oil state or not, we need to take care of the Earth and future generations,” said Emil Samarah, one of the developers. With the downward pressure from oil prices, the UAE has stepped up its efforts to wean itself off oil, lifting fossil fuel subsidies and billing Emiratis – not just expatriates – for water and electricity. But delivering on the original dream of Masdar has been elusive. Crews broke ground in 2008, but plans withered in the global economic recession which soon followed when investors put their green dreams on hold. “A lot of the people who were considering investing in Masdar City decided to take a breather,” Wan said. Meanwhile, the jet-set transport system was overtaken by technological developments in the auto sector. The expensive purpose-built system no longer made sense in an era when zero-emission electric cars were widely available. “Five years ago it’s true that we did not perceive the speed with which the electric vehicle would be developed,” Wan said. But he insisted that Masdar was not a total failure. “Masdar is part of an evolutionary process,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2014/jul/10/edf-nuclear-deal-is-a-bad-economic-bet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-10T11:12:07Z","webTitle":"EDF nuclear deal is a bad economic bet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/10/edf-nuclear-deal-is-a-bad-economic-bet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/10/edf-nuclear-deal-is-a-bad-economic-bet","fields":{"headline":"EDF nuclear deal is a bad economic bet","bodyText":"It has always been difficult to see what was attractive about the proposed deal with EDF to build a nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset. To bring this off the government is offering to sell 35 years of index-linked tax receipts to the French government to buy electricity at twice its current price. This is a very big bet on the ability of EDF to build a reactor on time and to budget – a feat they have never accomplished with the reactor type we are buying. It is an even bigger bet on the price of electricity doubling. If it fails to do so then the government will have to pay EDF even more subsidy. This is because the government has guaranteed the price that EDF will receive for all the electricity it produces. It has set this at £92.50 per megawatt hour. If EDF can only sell Hinkley’s electricity at less than this the government makes up the difference from a levy on consumers, effectively a tax. This creates a paradox. Thegovernment is keen to keep electricity prices low to reduce household bills and improve industry’s competitiveness. But if this policy succeeds it will have to pay even more subsidy to EDF from its nuclear tax. This makes a recent report by Moody’s very bad news indeed for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Wholesale electricity prices have fallen over 40% since 2011. They expect power prices to remain this low until at least 2020. Moody’s attribute the price fall to rising renewable output and falling demand. Thanks to Russia’s intervention in the Ukraine the downward pressure on demand is likely to accelerate. The commission’s proposal to set a Europe-wide energy efficiency target of a 27% reduction by 2030 is widely seen as unambitious. Many voices are now suggesting 41% as an achievable and cost-effective target. That would reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian gas by about 80% and easily pay for the necessary investment by the efficiency saving. Nor is there any sign that the momentum driving renewables is slowing. Renewable capacity, mainly solar and onshore wind, is now over 290 gigawatts in Europe. This is an increase of some 85GW since 2009 and equivalent to the capacity of 300 of Europe’s nuclear power stations. This is an average of about 21GW of new capacity a year. Even if you divide that by a third to allow for the variable output of renewables, you are still adding 7GW of dispatchable electricity a year. This compares rather well with the decade or more it would take to generate that much power from new nuclear power stations in Britain. These numbers not only make nuclear a very bad economic bet they also make it too slow to make a useful contribution to reducing carbon emissions. A combination of energy efficiency and renewables will reduce carbon pollution faster and more cheaply. If this were not bad enough news for Britain there is more to come. Moody’s expect German wholesale power prices to stay low at around £25/MWh – half that of the UK. Nordic power prices, excluding Finland, will be even lower at about £23/MWh. Both Italy and Spain are also likely to have lower wholesale electricity prices than Britain. It is hard to see what is clever about a policy that will damage the competitiveness of Britain’s manufacturing industry, slow rather than hasten carbon emissions reduction and force Britain’s electricity consumers to subsidise a French nationalised company. It is a tribute to the compelling power of the nuclear dream that England’s political parties have all bought into the fantasy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/nov/23/argentina-president-elect-mauricio-macri-iran-venezuela","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-23T17:53:02Z","webTitle":"Argentina president-elect pledges radical policy changes in shift to right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/23/argentina-president-elect-mauricio-macri-iran-venezuela","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/23/argentina-president-elect-mauricio-macri-iran-venezuela","fields":{"headline":"Argentina president-elect pledges radical policy changes in shift to right","bodyText":"Hours after Argentina’s political landscape underwent a tectonic rightward shift, president-elect Mauricio Macri announced a series of radical changes that will realign his country’s place in the world. Following Sunday night’s narrow election victory that marked the first change of government in 12 years, Macri said he would tear up Argentina’s memorandum of understanding with Iran, seek Venezuela’s exclusion from the regional free trade association Mercosur and ease away from a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. This is the “change of an era”, he declared at a press conference that was itself a sign of greater openness compared to the largely one-way media approach of his leftist predecessor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. “We need to be in the world.” Not seen as a serious contender during the first round of the campaign, Macri ultimately forced a runoff against Fernández’s hand-picked candidate Daniel Scioli and then won Sunday’s decider with 51.4% of the vote – less than three points ahead of his rival. That small margin of victory could hamper his ability to push through political changes, particularly because Macri does not have a majority in either house of congress. But the president-elect – who has previously proven his political and managerial nous as Buenos Aires mayor and president of Boca Juniors football club – said he would try to bridge the ideological divide by recruiting talents from all sides into his administration. “We are going to call on the best,” he said. “We need to search for space for dialogue.” His fortunes may yet depend on the outgoing president, who remains influential due to her popularity among rank-and-file Peronists, union members and supporters in congress. Macri said Fernández called to congratulate him on his victory and invited him to the Casa Rosada presidential palace to discuss the transition, which must be completed by 10 December. But the incoming and outgoing presidents have very different political outlooks. Fernández focused on social programs to address inequality, conducted a centralised economic policy, sought closer trade ties to China and Iran, and aligned herself regionally with like-minded leftist leaders in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. Macri, by contrast, has a more global market-orientated stance and looks likely to strengthen links with the United States. He said his priority would be economic rejuvenation, tackling inflation – currently at around 30% – and encouraging investment. “For four years, this country has been standing still,” he said. “We have to see where investment will come from.” He said he would establish an economic cabinet of six ministers and reassess the country’s much-maligned official statistics. Indicating other changes on the cards, he also said the fixed exchange rate with the dollar was an “error” and complained that the central bank lacks independence. But perhaps the most dramatic shift could be in foreign affairs, where Macri has threatened to shake up regional alliances. Asked if he still planned to seek the exclusion of Venezuela from the Mercusor trade bloc, Macri confirmed that he would raise the issue of that country’s “human rights abuses”. “The allegations against Venezuela are clear. They are not invented,” he said. This could put him at odds with other centre-left governments in the region, which have tended to show solidarity with Venezuela despite concerns about its deteriorating economy and political unrest. But Macri appeared ready to lobby for change. “We must build relations in Latin America,” he said. His first foreign visit, he announced, would be to Brazil – Argentina’s neighbour and most important trade partner. He has also spoken by phone to the leaders of Uruguay, Chile and Colombia. Foreign policy changes are likely to encompass a wider area. During the campaign, Macri said he would review a deal with China to build a nuclear power plant in Argentina. And he has rejected Fernández’s 2013 memorandum of understanding with Iran. Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries agreed to establish a truth commission on the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. Earlier this year, prosecutor Alberto Nisman accused Fernández of signing the deal to cover up Iran’s involvement in the bombing in return for commercial deals. Nisman was later found dead in still unexplained circumstances. Fernández denied the allegation, but Nisman’s mysterious death cast a shadow over the final months of her presidency. At his press conference on Monday, Macri was categorical: “We propose the repeal of the memorandum with Iran,” he said. His outlook is less clear on the territorial dispute with the UK over the Falkland Islands, which are known in Argentina as the Malvinas. While he is expected to take a less strident position than his predecessor, residents of the islands are cautious about the prospects for change. “Congratulations @mauriciomacri – Be smart. Work with us, not against,” said one Falkland Islands Twitter account. But another resident of the disputed islands said he was not optimistic about a rapprochement. “Whilst (Macri) may not attempt the ludicrous Kirchner approach to us, we should be aware that his approach – whilst undoubtedly more subtle – would doubtless have the same aim in sight,” wrote Dick Swale in an email. “I seriously doubt that Falkland Islanders would ever trust Argentine politicians, whoever they might be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T16:56:14Z","webTitle":"Forget HS2 – for real renewal, rebuild our crumbling coastline | Patrick Barkham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway","fields":{"headline":"Forget HS2 – for real renewal, rebuild our crumbling coastline\r\n","bodyText":"The acquisition of a 140-acre farm on the limestone headland of the Great Orme may not appear momentous, but this small Welsh treasure protected by the National Trust is the latest step in a journey that has transformed the character of our coast. Fifty years ago, Britain’s biggest coastal landowner was the Ministry of Defence. More than five miles of pristine coastline were being lost each year – to caravan parks, oil refineries and nuclear power stations. The wild coastline that remained was usually fenced off or overgrown. Strolling the south-west coast path, or the new 870-mile Wales coast path today, it is easy to forget the amazing efforts to prevent unspoilt cliffs and coves resembling the high-rise tourist traps of the Mediterranean or the suburban sprawl of much of the Sussex coast. Social and economic trends have helped – the decline of the domestic seaside holiday with the rise of cheap flights reduced pressure on the British seaside – but, mostly, the coast has been protected by local action and charity. In 1965, the National Trust launched Enterprise Neptune, a fundraising campaign to save the seaside from development. It caught the popular imagination of the day – even featuring on The Archers – and has continued, quietly, to protect the coast. Supported by local residents and small donations from people who often live as far away as possible from the sea (only 70 miles, in our uniquely coastal nation), the National Trust has become Britain’s biggest coastal landowner, safeguarding more than 775 miles of the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. (The National Trust for Scotland is a separate organisation.) For all its associations with stately homes, the National Trust grew out of the Victorian movement to protect the commons of London. The seaside is now a contemporary commons – freely accessible and preserved for everyone, for ever. Many of these miles are as beautiful as might be expected – a third of the Cornish coast is owned by the Trust – but many are less celebrated: the charity helped rehabilitate Durham’s coal-wrecked coastline and has taken on badly contaminated military sites such as Orford Ness in Suffolk, allowing its cold war ruins to gently decay rather than tidying them up. The Trust has not single-handedly saved the coast. Other charities, including the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB have also acquired many important estuaries and marshes. Tighter planning regulations, and government-led initiatives such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty have helped hugely. But it is striking how much has been achieved by the big society, to use language calibrated to attract this government’s attention. And attracting the attention of David Cameron’s administration will be important because the coast will change perhaps more dramatically than ever in the coming century. While the battle against intrusive coastal housing has largely been won, marine conservation is still in its infancy. Our hunger for energy will see empty horizons filled with offshore wind farms, new nuclear power stations and tidal barrages. Tidal could provide positive opportunities to reshape our coast in a way that augments wildlife and recreation but other developments will industrialise once wild landscapes. Climate change, rising seas and increasingly fierce storms also threaten to redraw the coastline and throw at least 7,000 homes into the sea this century. Because British governments still cling to an archaic law which absolves them of ever compensating people who lose homes to the waves, this erosion could accelerate the decline of coastal communities impoverished by the loss of fishing and domestic tourism. There are no easy answers to these big questions but a simple footpath could help. In announcing its acquisition on the Great Orme, the National Trust signalled its determination to hold the government to its commitment to create a coast path for England by 2020. Conservationists fear this will become another promise broken by austerity, but the government would be foolish to abandon such a popular policy. A coast path is a far more inspiring piece of infrastructure than HS2, with real economic heft: the south-west coast path generates £436m for the regional economy each year, supporting 10,000 jobs. A pathway around England is far more than an economic prop, however. The Trust’s former director-general, Fiona Reynolds, recently argued that it could be the first step in the creation of a new coastal zone, a kind of decentralised national park in which local people have a real say in how their coast is developed and cared for. As well as a footpath, a government with real vision could create a coastal national park which harnessed the economic regeneration of impoverished areas with environmental protection, recreation and a sensible discussion of how best to adapt to rising seas. I can’t think of many finer legacies for any politician. Perhaps the National Trust could be more radical too, and use Neptune funds to preserve more unusual coastal treasures – how about preserving a pier or some of the unique, threatened plotlands coast such as Jaywick Sands? Open space by the sea brings immeasurable health benefits, solace, artistic inspiration and exhilaration to every generation. We must summon every piece of our passion for the coast in the coming century to maintain this rich resource for everybody."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/13/chinese-activists-xi-jinping-magna-carta","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-13T11:14:47Z","webTitle":"Chinese activists urge Xi Jinping to learn from Magna Carta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/chinese-activists-xi-jinping-magna-carta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/13/chinese-activists-xi-jinping-magna-carta","fields":{"headline":"Chinese activists urge Xi Jinping to learn from Magna Carta","bodyText":"Chinese activists have urged President Xi Jinping to visit a rare exhibition of Magna Carta in Beijing, after the text, which some celebrate as a cornerstone of modern democracy, went on display as part of commemorations of its 800th anniversary. A 1217 version held by Hereford Cathedral, one of only 17 surviving 13th-century texts of the Great Charter, was put on show at the British ambassador’s residence on Tuesday. It will head to Shanghai and Guangzhou later in the week. British officials have hailed Magna Carta’s arrival as the latest milestone in a “golden era” of UK-China relations during which Xi will pay a state visit to Britain next week. Mark Gill, the head of the Magna Carta 800th anniversary committee, said he hoped to boost awareness and understanding of the text, which was issued in 1215 by King John of England and is held up as a symbol of government accountability and individual freedoms. Fewer than one in five people in China had even heard of it, Gill claimed. As the Magna Carta went on show, Chinese activists called on Xi – who has been accused of launching an unforgiving crackdown on dissent – to go to see a text the British Library has called “a potent, international rallying cry against the arbitrary use of power”. “I very much hope that Xi can go and see [the exhibition],” said Yu Wensheng, an outspoken attorney who was among those targeted during a continuing roundup of civil rights lawyers. Yu said Magna Carta’s presence in China “should serve as a reminder to [Xi] and the leadership that cracking down on lawyers is wrong and futile”. Liu Shihui, another civil rights lawyer, noted Xi often name-checked famous pieces of writing, including Hemingway and Dostoyevsky. “I hope he can spend some time reading Magna Carta,” Liu said. Sir Martin Davidson, the chairman of the Great Britain China Centre in Beijing for the exhibition’s launch, recognised King John’s text was arriving at a sensitive time. A political chill has descended on Beijing since Xi came to power in 2012 and a severe crackdown is under way. “One wouldn’t be surprised that it is slightly uncomfortable because I think China is struggling with some of those very big issues about what is the relationship between the state and the law, what comprises the state,” he said. Many Chinese were interested in Magna Carta because it symbolised the moment at which “the king became subject to the rule of law and the king’s power was, if you like, constrained by the nature of the rule of law”, Davidson said. But he denied that bringing the document to China was an attempt to preach to Beijing. “I don’t think there is any point in saying: ‘We’ve got a system, just copy it.’ That’s not going to happen.” During a speech in June marking Magna Carta’s 800th birthday, the UK prime minister, David Cameron, celebrated the text as a symbol of “liberty, justice, democracy [and] the rule of law”. “All over the world, people are still struggling to live by the rule of law and to see their governments subject to that law. The countries that have these things tend to be the long-term successes. Those who don’t tend to be the long-term failures,” he said. Experts say such ideas will be low on the agenda when Xi’s state visit begins next Tuesday. The British chancellor, George Osborne, recently vowed to make Britain China’s “best partner in the west” and activists accuse London of falling silent on Beijing’s human rights record to avoid damaging business ties. Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat in China and the author of a forthcoming book on Xi, said Britain’s China policy was clearly being dictated by the Treasury, with thorny issues such as human rights pushed to one side. “[Xi Jinping’s visit] is going to be remorseless and relentlessly about parting the Chinese and their money. That is really what we are interested in,” Brown said, pointing to plans for Chinese investment in British nuclear power plants and infrastructure. China expects Britain to roll out the red carpet during Xi’s visit next week, which involves events in London and Manchester. But it is unclear how welcome Magna Carta is in Beijing. Plans to put the text on show at the capital’s prestigious Renmin University were unexpectedly scrapped. Asked if Chinese authorities had prevented it from being publicly displayed there, Davidson said: “Not that I’m aware of. There simply wasn’t the time to put in place the right mechanisms.” Additional reporting by Luna Lin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2016/may/03/engineering-apprenticeships-courses-women-engineers-education-degrees","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-03T09:45:18Z","webTitle":"Meet the next generation of women engineers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/engineering-apprenticeships-courses-women-engineers-education-degrees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2016/may/03/engineering-apprenticeships-courses-women-engineers-education-degrees","fields":{"headline":"Meet the next generation of women engineers","bodyText":"“When I was thinking about careers, I never thought of engineering, as the public image is being under a machine, getting dirty,” says Jade Aspinall, 23, a manufacturing engineer at missile producer MBDA Systems and winner of the higher apprentice of the year award in the National Apprenticeship Awards 2015. “I work on minuscule components under a microscope in a clean room – there’s not a speck of dust anywhere,” Aspinall says. “It’s not something a lot of women would consider, just because they don’t know enough about it. There’s no doubt that there are a lot of male engineers, but as a woman, I’ve never been treated any differently. In fact, I’ve had a lot of support.” It wasn’t until an MBDA apprentice spoke about engineering at her school that Aspinall considered it as a career. And she was one of the lucky ones who were made aware of it as an option. There’s no telling how many women who could have made successful engineers never even considered it as a career option, but there must be plenty out there. Just 9% of the engineering workforce and 6% of registered engineers and technicians are female. That is the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe, way behind the leaders, Latvia, Bulgaria and Cyprus, with nearly 30%. So what’s stopping the UK’s women going into engineering? Nothing physical – in fact, lots of schemes encourage them, says Dawn Bonfield, materials engineer and chief executive of the Women’s Engineering Society, including big employers such as British Gas, Network Rail and Crossrail. What’s holding them back is a lack of knowledge of what engineering is, and a lack of advice. At the moment, Bonfield says, women are making it in the engineering world, but they tend to be the ones who are absolutely determined to do so. “We call them the Stem [science, technology, engineering or maths] devotees, and they will make it, no matter what,” she says. “But we’re determined to reach those women who might not have even considered engineering as a career. “Engineering is a brilliant choice for women who want to do something, who have a big social conscience, and who want to change the world. It has just as much to offer as the ‘traditional’ professions such as law and medicine. It’s about making the world more sustainable and more renewable. There are fantastic challenges out there, and women are using engineering as a way of finding solutions.” What needs to be done to encourage more women into the sector? Schemes such as MBDA’s are making a start. The company has achieved a 50/50 gender split within its engineering apprenticeships, something which spokesman Conal Walker attributes in part to the requirements of its outreach programme. Any school that wants an MBDA apprentice to give a talk must ensure that the audience has that 50/50 split too. It’s a figure that bucks the national trend, where just 7.4% of engineering apprenticeship starters in 2013-14 were female. Bonfield wants the message around engineering to change to something far more positive. “It’s about applying a thought process to make things better,” she says, “whether that’s designing a nuclear power station or getting clean water to people in development countries.” But she wants to see far more careers information to back that message up, and an independent careers service for engineering to help unpick what can be a confusing choice of courses. Aspinall agrees. “Engineering is such a broad church,” she says. “There needs to be much more awareness about the range of careers. Everything in the room where I’m sitting has been engineered. It’s a job for life. It gives you transferable skills, it’s exciting and it’s making things bigger and better as new technology comes along.” Pensuree: ‘I got my first taste for engineering aged 11’ Pensuree Wallis, 19, had always wanted to make things work better, so engineering was a natural fit for her. “I love mechanical and electrical work, and I think that’s what made me go into engineering,” she says. “But I was also really attracted to the fact that you could do apprenticeships and gain hands-on experience while getting recognised qualifications.” Wallis is in her fourth year of an apprenticeship at Eurostar International, which she began just four days after her 16th birthday. She had her first taste of engineering there when she undertook work experience in year 11. “I really enjoyed it,” she says. “Everyone made me feel comfortable. There were so many people who were really clever and could teach me. And there were female engineers, which really grabbed me. So I applied for an apprenticeship, and got it.” Apprenticeships weren’t talked about much at her school, she says, and her teachers and friends were surprised at her choice. “It was assumed that you would stay on at school or go to college. Not many people said they wanted to do an apprenticeship. It shocked people, but I think they’re used to it now.” During her first year, she studied full-time at college, then one day a week subsequently. The rest of her time is spent at work. “My college studies are really relevant to what I’m doing at work, especially on the electronics side,” she says. “For example, I’ve had projects at work which involve making test boxes. So I’ll make a circuit board and it will go in a test box which will connect to a train component. That way you can see whether it’s faulty or not. The work-life-study balance is challenging but my employers have been great: if I need a day to do college work, they’re fine with that.” She hasn’t just gained engineering sector skills, either. “You learn to be in a workplace,” Wallis says. “You don’t get that experience of working in a team at university. Every year, we do specific team-building exercises designed to help us develop into better apprentices.” Wallis will shortly gain her higher apprenticeship qualification, and will then start a degree in general engineering, also funded by Eurostar. She says women should seek out engineering apprenticeship opportunities. “When I first wanted to become an engineer, I found it a bit daunting. But as soon as I was in that environment, I realised that there wasn’t anything to be worried about. You’re part of the team and you have just the same opportunities as everyone else. So go for it!” Interview by Lucy Jolin Casey: ‘People were shocked when I said I wanted to become a marine engineer’ Casey Keenan, 20, is a marine engineering apprentice with Team One Engineering in Southampton, which provides services to the marine and industrial sectors for the maintenance and overhaul of diesel and gas engines. As part of her apprenticeship, Keenan is studying towards an NVQ level 3 in marine engineering, and attends City College Southampton’s Marine Skills Centre once a week. “I was quite academic at school and I actually got 16 GCSEs, so a lot of people were quite shocked when I said I wanted to become a marine engineer,” Keenan says. “Apprenticeships were mentioned but it wasn’t really talked about that much and it was assumed I’d go to university – but I just wanted to get out there and work. “I did look for an apprenticeship straight out of school but it was a bit nerve-racking going from school to a full-time job, so I didn’t pass the interviews. I decided to go to the Marine Skills Centre for a year at first and got a level one in marine engineering, and then I got my apprenticeship after that.” As a youngster, Keenan says she was always one of those kids who wanted to be anything she saw on TV. “At one point I wanted to be a police officer, then I wanted to join the army, then I wanted to be a vet, even a professional ice skater. That all changed when I was introduced to engineering. I just love getting hands-on with a task, and I really got into it.” Keenan did the first two years of her apprenticeship at a different company, but was able to transfer to her current employer without having to start again. It’s something that taught her about the kind of work she wanted to do, she says. “Because my first company dealt with new builds, all the engines were under warranty, so we weren’t allowed to touch them.” “I wanted to be more hands-on with them, so the college put me in touch with Team One, and now I couldn’t be happier. I recently had to do a refit on one of the Red Funnel car ferries, which was something I really enjoyed.” Keenan finishes her apprenticeship in June 2017 and wants to start travelling right away. “One thing I really like about engineering is that I never know what job I’m going to be on, or where I’m going to be. I could get asked to go to another site, or work on a different project, which is really exciting. I haven’t been any further than Kent yet, though! “At my first placement I had the chance to go to Korea to work on a project, but my passport was out of date and I couldn’t go. I made sure I renewed it straight away, so if anything else comes up, there’ll be no stopping me. “Once finished, I’ll have a trade which is needed everywhere, so even though I’m doing marine engineering, at the end of the day, an engine is still an engine, so I can go anywhere in the world.” Interview by Allison Dickinson Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/09/chance-show-truth-into-heart-of-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-09T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"‘We have a chance to show the truth’: into the heart of Chernobyl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/09/chance-show-truth-into-heart-of-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/09/chance-show-truth-into-heart-of-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"‘We have a chance to show the truth’: into the heart of Chernobyl","bodyText":"At first they thought it was just a fire, then the chickens started to turn black. When it comes to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, everyone has a vivid detail that is snagged in the memory; the absurdities or the obscenities. It might be the local village that, once evacuated, was claimed by a mob of pigs. Or the way milk would turn to white powder whenever the residents of Pripyat (the town built a few hundred metres from the doomed power plant) would attempt to churn butter. Or the cat that refused to be stuffed into a suitcase by its owner, who couldn’t bear to abandon his pet during the mass exile, 36 hours after the explosion. Who can forget that 70 Belarusian villages had to be buried under the ground? Or that Soviet soldiers shot every dog, in case it wandered, toxically, into a neighbouring city? Or that many of those same men risked their lives hoisting flags on the roofs of buildings every few weeks, whenever the old ones were chewed to lace by the radioactive breeze? For many, it is the story of a 23-year-old pregnant woman, married to one of the brave and reckless firemen who put out the blaze at reactor number four in the early morning of 26 April 1986. Doctors at the Moscow hospital to which he was transferred warned her not to hug her husband. She refused, tending to him even when the nurses would no longer enter the room where he lay, naked, under a sheet of thick plastic. Two months after he died, she visited the cemetery where he was buried in a matryoshka nest of coffins: one zinc and, within that, one wooden. She knelt at his grave and promptly went into labour. At her late husband’s suggestion, she named the baby Natashenka. Due to the radiation, Natashenka was born with cirrhosis of the liver and congenital heart disease. She died less than four hours later in a tragedy of appalling symmetry: a child both conceived and destroyed in her parents’ lingering embrace. Many of Pripyat’s residents watched the fires – caused when a steam explosion sent the nuclear reactor’s casing through the roof of the building – from the balconies of their flats. They saw the factory transform into a volcano, spitting super-heated lumps of graphite that set fires wherever they landed. Like the proverbial frog in boiling water, nobody registered the heat in which they cooked – radiation’s imperceptible blaze. While the Soviet authorities neglected to tell the people the extent of the danger they were in, for fear of causing mass panic, tell-tale symptoms soon followed. Dark marks appeared on the skin. The wattles of the local chickens turned from crimson to black. For Sergey Franchuk, who accompanies visitors inside the 30km radius that surrounds the infamous power plant – known, variously, as the “zone of exclusion”, the “closed zone” and, most potently, the “death zone” – the enduring memory of those days is not the chickens but the vodka. “Vodka became our money,” he tells me with a smile that reveals a spattering of gold teeth. “We paid for petrol with vodka. We paid for food with vodka. Everyone was drunk all of the time.” Franchuk, dressed in military getup, claims to be one of only three people to have worked inside the zone for more than a decade. On the night of the explosion, he woke to the sound of urgent knocking on his front door. It was his neighbour, a fireman, en route to the reactor. “He told me to take my wife and daughter and drive far away,” Franchuk recalls. He returned to Chernobyl alone the next day. “I wanted to help,” he says, “but only military people were allowed. My brother was in the army. He was dead within four years. So was my neighbour.” Today, Franchuk lives in the same village, just outside the death zone. It is illegal to live inside its radius, although the Ukrainian government ignores the few hundred samosely: mostly elderly settlers who have returned to their homes and villages on the otherwise forsaken land (most returned without registering; there are no official figures). I am visiting a few weeks ahead of the 30th anniversary of the catastrophe. Today, Chernobyl, three decades on from the most notorious and harmful day in the history of nuclear power, remains mysterious and stigmatic. People don’t know how to respond when I tell them where I’m going. Don’t drink the water, they say. Take some iodine. Wear thick underpants. Despite this wariness, an increasing number of tourists visit Chernobyl each year. There is no souvenir shop and no guarantee that you won’t injure yourself in the debris. The only working toilets are at the corrugated train station or the power plant. Franchuk, who is a kind of health and safety officer, has finished his first bottle of cognac by 11am. The second is done by 3pm. Still, the curious come at a rate of a few thousand each year. Most arrive via Kiev, an hour’s drive away. Around $200 (£140) will buy you a tour in a group of 40 or so other visitors, with a brief survey of the zone’s best known sights: Pripyat’s crumbling high school, its swimming pool and town square, with its redundant ferris wheel and dodgems; $600 (£415) will get you a better class of expedition, one run by 31-year-old Pawel Mielczarek, the organiser of my trip. When Mielczarek was a young boy growing up in Warsaw, Poland, he owned only one book – an encyclopaedia. Even before he was able to read, his eye was drawn to the haunting photographs that illustrated Chernobyl’s entry. “I’d ask my mother: what is this? I don’t understand this picture,” he tells me. “‘It’s a big, big tragedy,’ she explained. After many years, I decided: OK, I must see this.” Since his first visit seven years ago, Mielczarek has come here more than 70 times, bringing people from across the world, and helping to make survivors such as Franchuk a little money working as guides. Mielczarek will take you to see practically anything you want: Pripyat’s exquisite cafe, with its broken, stained-glass frontage; the nodding cranes by the river’s edge; the hospital where doctors tended to the sick and who, in doing so, almost certainly gave their lives. Almost nowhere is off-limits, so long as you let Mielczarek know in advance. The Soviets may be gone, but red tape remains. Every location requires a different permit. There are many more who would like to peer inside the zone, but who are too afraid or too remote to come. While technology has yet to find a way to dispose of the 20 tons of nuclear fuel that sits inside the reactor, it has recently presented a way for everyone to visit Chernobyl: virtual reality. In Pripyat’s once-luxurious swimming pool, Michał Grzesiczek, creative director at Polish software developer The Farm 51, places a tripod crowned with an array of GoPro cameras. We hide behind crumbling pillars as he presses a button on a device strapped to his wrist. All 14 cameras flash in unison. Using the images they take, Grzesiczek and his team will be able to create a 3D model of the swimming pool. Like adding wallpaper to a blank wall, the model is then plastered with photographs, thereby creating an exact replica of the scene. Finally, through a virtual-reality helmet, we are able to roam the scene as if present, examining the peeling paint on the ladder to the diving board, or looking down at the shantytown of wreckage in the deep end. Chernobyl VR, as the project is plainly titled, is due to launch this month. It’s just one of a number of projects around the world using this emerging technology to allow people to visit places that are otherwise difficult or impossible to access. French researchers have recreated the site of the Normandy landings; another team has turned scenes depicted in Van Gogh’s paintings into virtual rooms that can be entered and explored. The Chernobyl app will, initially, present three locations: the school, the swimming pool and an abandoned house in a more remote village. More will be added in the coming months. It’s a major undertaking. Scanning a small room of about 20 sq ft takes four hours. An expansive site such as the swimming pool takes two days and requires 10,000 images. The team believes it’s worth the effort. “Chernobyl is such a mysterious, mystical place,” Grzesiczek says, as he moves the tripod a few feet forward to prepare the next shot. “We have a chance here to show people the truth. We can also capture it as it is now. Everything here changes so quickly.” It is a work of voyeurism, then, but also documentary. After all, this is a reality twice disappeared: the world of 1986 and the world of Soviet dominion. In the school, period books litter the floor, along with appallingly small gas masks, props of the cold war. Black-and-white photographs of Russia’s great leaders hang, staring down at rows of empty desks. A wall in one classroom displays Lenin’s slogan: “Study, study, study.” A veteran of Chernobyl, Sergey Akulinin, will offer commentary as we tour these scenes. Akulinin had been living in Pripyat for six years as a turbine operator when the explosion occurred. That night, he was on shift at a neighbouring reactor. Today, he is the only guide working in Chernobyl who survived the blast from such close proximity. Why did he decide to take part in this project. “Project?” he says, with a flash of irritation. “This isn’t a project for me. This is my life.” Akulinin, now 60, offers to show me his old apartment. We crunch through the snow to the first floor of a block of flats pocked with broken windows. “I have come here every week for the past 25 years,” he says, gesturing towards the room where his sons, aged two and six at the time, once slept. “I left in 1986, but this is still home to me. My boys came for the first time only recently. My older son remembered the corner where he’d stand when he was naughty. My younger son could remember only the wallpaper by his bed. They never imagined that coming here would be so emotional.” Chernobyl is spooky, in the manner of all disowned places. Not just because of the ghosts of lives departed – the naked doll lying face-down in the rubble; the pair of dusty high heels toppled in a stairwell; the melting pianos – but also for the speed at which nature can be seen to unpick human handiwork. Every building has been stripped and shamed by erosion. Every room offers a new apocalyptic vignette, a reminder of human and civic fragility. The odd sapling can be seen questing its way up through gaps in water-damaged floorboards. The sound of rain comes from inside the buildings, not out. Just how dangerous is all of this anyway, I ask Mielczarek as we wait in the cold for the VR team to finish their photoshoot. We are, after all, not required to wear any protective clothing. He takes out a pocket dosimeter and holds it to the ground. It reads 0.25 microsieverts (about one quarter of one millionth of a sievert), roughly comparable to the radiation levels in London. To put this in context, radiation levels in Chernobyl’s control room immediately after the explosion reached about 300 sieverts, a dose that proves lethal after just one minute. “You could happily spend a safe year in the closed zone today, even sleeping here,” Mielczarek says. There are, however, rules. Just below the topsoil, radiation levels rise precipitously. As Mielczarek explains, the reason people haven’t been allowed back is because children might dig up the ground. Only humans could pervert a world so that concrete becomes safer than soil. Before anyone who visits Chernobyl is allowed to leave, they must step into one of the Soviet radiation detectors housed at its myriad checkpoints. It’s a contraption rather like a public phone box, with two of the walls removed. You face a black screen and press your hands on sensor pads on the outer side of the machine. If it’s bad news, after a few moments, a light turns red and an alarm sounds. You are then held on site until either a doctor can examine you, or the security removes whatever toxic memento you’ve hidden in your bag (a few years ago, two visitors managed to smuggle some irradiated rags through the detector; they were caught at an airport, held for a few days and issued with a hefty fine). If you’re free of radiation when you step into the detector, a yellow light flashes: “chisto” – clean. Later that day, we visit the hospital where many of the first responders were taken. It is, I’m told, one of three genuinely dangerous places in Chernobyl (the others being the factory where fuel rods were manufactured, and the reactor building itself). There is a pile of charred rags on the counter. Mielczarek approaches with the dosimeter and it shoots up to 83 microsieverts – 400 times the radiation level of the street outside – blaring an obnoxious warning. Some rooms in the hospital, he says, are filled with similar scraps of radioactive clothing. They can administer an entire year’s safe dosage of sieverts in a single hit. I spend an unsafe hour peering into derelict sick bays with their rusty cots, cracked toilets and toppled medicine bottles. Outside these contaminated wards, however, Chernobyl is, for now, a safe place. Two and a half thousand people currently work inside the zone. While a handful are employed as security guards and guides, most work at the power plant itself, either as medical researchers or involved in the constant task of ensuring the safety of the reactor (eg plugging gaps that appear in its concrete casing), or preparing meals for these workers in the antiseptic canteen. Every day, they take the only train to the site from Slavutych (a town 40 miles from the power plant that was built to home Pripyat’s evacuees). There is a crush of bodies at about 8am each morning. On the second day, as we enter Chernobyl by train, I notice an outbuilding scrawled with graffiti in English: “Welcome to hell.” We are so familiar with Chernobyl’s post-apocalyptic style through film, television and video games that, like so much here, it seems too cliched to take seriously. But, for a moment, Chernobyl was a hell on Earth, a portal of life-perverting torment. Then they dropped bags of sand on the reactor from helicopters. And they pumped liquid nitrogen up through a tunnel beneath the reactor. And hell froze over. Today, however, the analogy is due a renaissance. Thirty years is no arbitrary anniversary. Like any frantic fix, the concrete offered only a temporary solution. The sarcophagus, as the engineers refer to the reactor’s hastily erected shell, was designed to last for only three decades. “The original sarcophagus was just placed on top,” says Julia Konstantinovna, Chernobyl’s official spokeswoman. “This was intended to be a localising solution, merely to contain the vast amount of nuclear fuel generated as a result of the explosion.” She points at the reactor behind her, visible through a widescreen window, on which there are multiple stickers forbidding photography. Around the viewing gallery are the flags of nations who have donated the €1.54bn (£1.29bn) needed to replace the cracking concrete. The disintegrating walls have created an estimated four tons of black, radioactive dust. The new solution is a vast steel sheath, large enough to encase Notre Dame cathedral. This curved dome has been built to one side of the melted reactor, ready to be rolled on giant rails to cover the entire plant. The dome is 9m deep and hollowed on the inside to allow warm air to be pumped through. This will reduce the moisture inside the reactor by up to 40%, slowing the process of degradation. The technology is focused on buying more time. While the plan is eventually to dismantle the power plant brick by brick, Konstantinovna admits that we do not yet have the technology to safely dispose of what’s inside. “The new dome is intended to last for 100 years,” she says. “This should create the time frame to develop the necessary technologies.” After her polished presentation is complete (the week before I arrive, she gave the same performance to a delegation from the US government), I ask Konstantinovna why she came to Chernobyl with her husband, a nuclear engineer, and two young children in 1990 from their home in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. “I remember the day when I heard about what had happened. It felt like somewhere very far from me. Then, four years later, I came. I don’t know why.” Who just comes to Chernobyl? “Sometimes my friends ask me the same question,” she says. “Many of the people who came here worked 10, 20 years in the field of power engineering. They are experts and wanted to be useful. So, yes, it was important work. But, really, I think a lot of people came here to escape personal problems. Chernobyl is a place for people who want to run away.” Akulinin, who lived through the disaster, has stayed here despite retiring 14 years ago (one day spent working in the zone counts as five towards your pension). But he has tried to run away from the catastrophe in his own way. Often during our time together, I ask him to tell me what happened that night. “I will tell you tomorrow,” he says at first. Then, “I will tell you after lunch.” Finally, on the last day: “I will tell you tonight, over a bottle of vodka. We will need hours.” He knew by then that I would be gone before the evening. Svetlana Alexievich, whose book Voices From Chernobyl won the Nobel prize in literature, describes how it took hours and hours of interview time before Lyudmilla Ignatenko, the woman whose husband, the fireman, was buried like a matryoshka doll, surrendered her true story. It was too costly, too private. Even during the final recounting, Ignatenko said: “It’s impossible to describe. It’s impossible to write down. And even to get over.” The world is not over Chernobyl, either. Chernobyl remains emblematic of what can go wrong when the miracle that is nuclear power (statistically the safest power source) is mishandled. Extreme radiation’s effects, which vary wildly from person to person, can have the grotesque absurdity of a Grimm fairytale. According to eyewitness accounts, one man grew fat “like a barrel”, while another shrunk until he could wear only children’s clothes. Conservative estimates put the final death toll at 4,000. While a surge in cases of thyroid cancer among children (caused by drinking irradiated breast milk) was indisputably caused by the catastrophe, most experts agree that the broader health impacts cannot be meaningfully quantified. Part of our interest is to do with past losses, then. And yet the futuristic threat remains. It is a myth worthy of the ancients: a great terror, encased in crumbling concrete, brought into the world by man, against which man has no adequate defence. We cannot send it back. The mistake cannot be undone. Thirty years later, whatever the damage, Chernobyl, and all that it represents, remains unfixed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/08/second-solar-firm-in-two-days-goes-bust-blaming-tory-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-08T17:48:41Z","webTitle":"Second solar firm in two days goes bust, blaming UK government policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/second-solar-firm-in-two-days-goes-bust-blaming-tory-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/08/second-solar-firm-in-two-days-goes-bust-blaming-tory-policy","fields":{"headline":"Second solar firm in two days goes bust, blaming UK government policy","bodyText":"The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has denied that subsidy cuts were responsible for the collapse of two solar panel installers in as many days, blaming the company failures on “commercial decisions”. Amid warnings of a crisis in the green energy sector following the failure of Mark Group and Climate Energy and a forecast that 20,000 solar jobs could eventually be threatened, the Decc defended aid cuts for solar and energy efficiency. “All job losses are regrettable and we sympathise with those affected, but commercial decisions are a matter for the company concerned,” said a DECC spokesman. “Our priority is to keep bills as low as possible for hardworking families and businesses, and to build a long-term energy-efficiency system that gives consumers value for money. We are protecting existing investment and billpayers, while reducing our emissions in the most cost-effective way,” he said. However, the dramatic demise of two leading companies following a series of cuts, and proposals for more, brought a furious reaction from environmental and trade groups. A Friends of the Earth energy campaigner, Alasdair Cameron, said: “Government policy threatens over 20,000 UK solar jobs – with many more at risk in other green sectors. It seems the Treasury is happier to give sky-high subsidies to Chinese nuclear power than support British solar. The renewable energy industry around the world is booming and costs are falling rapidly but the UK government seems to be stuck in the wrong century.” Neil Marshall, chief executive of the National Insulation Association, called for urgent help from ministers to avoid further company closures, job cuts and loss of confidence. “While the government has outlined its intention to introduce a new long-term policy framework for energy efficiency, which we welcome, the insulation industry is currently in a state of crisis.” After almost 1,000 redundancies on Wednesday at the Mark Group after it was forced to call in administrators from Deloitte amid mounting financial losses, the solar panel and insulation installers Climate Energy also folded into administration, blaming government policies. About 30 of Climate Energy’s 128 staff have been immediately laid off by FTI Consulting, the professional services firm brought in to try to rescue the firm and its subsidiaries, which had revenues of £47m last year. The administrators said the company, which has offices in Bristol, Croydon and Motherwell as well as headquarters in Witham, Essex, said solar-subsidy cuts were a “contributory factor” in Climate Energy’s demise. The Mark Group was, until hours before its failure, owned by the major US group SunEdison, which passed the Leicester-based business on to its managers who immediately announced it was insolvent. Mark Babcock, vice-president of SunEdison’s residential and commercial business unit in Europe, pointedly blamed the government for Mark Group’s problems: “Given the latest changes and proposed changes to the feed-in tariff [subsidy regime], it is difficult to see [Britain] as a viable market going forward.” In the months since the general election and Amber Rudd taking over as secretary of state for energy and climate change, there has been a major change in policy direction. A range of cuts have been made to wind, solar and energy-efficiency subsidies – the latest a consultation on a proposed 87% reduction in financial aid for householders installing solar panels. Rudd argues that continuing subsidies are no longer needed at past levels because technology costs have fallen while other consumers need to be protected from higher energy bills. Figures published by the regulator Ofgem and other sources show the rate of solar subsidies for small-scale rooftop installations dropping from 41.3p per kilowatt hour in 2010 to a proposed level of 1.63p while costs have stagnated over the last 12 months. It would take 25 years for an investment in solar to pay back under the proposed new scheme, which is under consultation for implementation in January, 2016. Critics believe the attack on subsidies is driven by the chancellor, George Osborne, as part of a wider austerity policy and as a means to please Conservative backbenchers, who believe “green” power is expensive and unnecessary. Boris Johnson, the Conservative leadership hopeful, and a small number of other MPs have expressed disquiet about the cuts. On Thursday night, the Tory MP David Warburton, described the proposed cuts as “draconian”. The MP for Somerton and Frome said: “We know the solar industry fully expected some rationalisation, but a drop of up to 87% in subsidies overnight is draconian and more than I suspect the industry can bear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/07/san-onofre-nuclear-reactors-shut-down","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-07T17:10:00Z","webTitle":"Activists hail San Onofre nuclear power plant reactor shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/07/san-onofre-nuclear-reactors-shut-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/07/san-onofre-nuclear-reactors-shut-down","fields":{"headline":"Activists hail San Onofre nuclear power plant reactor shutdown","bodyText":"America's nuclear reactor fleet moved deeper into middle-aged crisis on Friday when operators decide to shut down two reactors at the troubled San Onofre power plant in California. They were the third and fourth reactors to be permanently retired this year, underlining the harsh economics facing America's ageing fleet of nuclear reactors, forced to pay for expensive upkeep at a time of increased competition from cheap natural gas and renewable energy. The two reactors at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (Songs) in southern California had been off-line since January 2012, after the discovery of a radioactive steam leak in one of the units. Southern California Edison, which runs the plant, had been pushing to re-start one of the reactors on a limited basis. But there was strong public opposition, and the risk of legal action after the Democratic Senator, Barbara Boxer, last week asked the Justice Department to investigate the plant. The former nuclear regulator, Greg Jaczko, further set back prospects for a re-start at San Onofre when he told a nuclear safety conference in San Diego that the idea was \"not one that instills tremendous confidence in me\". On Friday morning, the company said it had decided it was uneconomic to try to stay in operation. \"We have concluded that the continuing uncertainty about when or if Songs might return to service was not good for our customers, our investors, or the need to plan for our region's long-term electricity needs,\" Ted Craver, the company's chief executive said in a statement on Friday.. Boxer said she was \"greatly relieved\" at the decision.\"Modifications to the San Onofre nucler plan were unsafe and posed a danger to the eight million people living within 50 miles of the plant,\" she said in a statement. The decision to shut down Units 2 and 3 reduced the number of licenced reactors to an even 100 – the lowest number in two decades. The plant had been in operation for 40 years. But age caught up to the plants in January 2012 when operators detected a leak inside a steam generator in Unit 3. The leak was inside a new steam generator, made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which had been installed in 2009. But nuclear experts said maintenance and upkeep of reactors had become increasingly challenging – especially with heightened safety requirements introduced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. \"Reactors have basically hit their middle-aged crisis. They are through their performance plateau. They are starting to experience ageing issues across the board and maintaining safety is expensive,\" said Jim Riccio, a nuclear safety analyst for Greenpeace. \"You are having reactors with a lot of ageing problems and the NRC is catching up with problems that hadn't been fixed for a long time.\" Four nuclear reactors have been shut down so far just this year. In addition to the two reactors at San Onofre, operators permanently retired the Crystal River reactor in Florida in February, after running into significant problems with repairs. The Kewaunee reactor in Washington shut down last month because operators said they could not compete with the prices of natural gas. A number of other nuclear plants are off-line for repair, such as Fort Calhoun in Nebraska which has been shuttered since April 2011 because of flood risks and other safety problems. Some of those plants, especially those with single reactors, could also be in line for shut-downs by the end of the decade, said David Lochbaum, nuclear safety expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Or as Jaczko the former regulator told the nuclear safety conference earlier this week: \"I think it's time that we need to reconsider prolonging the lifetime of many of these reactors.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/jan/07/north-korea-nuclear-the-questions-you-were-afraid-to-ask","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-07T09:50:20Z","webTitle":"North Korea’s nuclear test: your questions answered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/north-korea-nuclear-the-questions-you-were-afraid-to-ask","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/jan/07/north-korea-nuclear-the-questions-you-were-afraid-to-ask","fields":{"headline":"North Korea’s nuclear test: your questions answered","bodyText":"At 10am Pyongyang time on Wednesday the Korean peninsula felt a seismic shake said to measure 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale. It wasn’t an earthquake, it quickly transpired, but an alleged fourth nuclear test carried out by the North Korean government. As the news ricocheted around the world, people began to question the size and scale of the explosion that North Korea claimed had been produced by a miniature hydrogen bomb. Did we know this was coming? Does it signal that Kim Jong-un’s powers are growing? Should North Korea’s neighbours be scared? And what are the consequences for international diplomacy with the infamous pariah state? We bring you answers to some of the key questions raised across the Guardian’s comment threads – that you may be too embarrassed to ask yourself. Where was it? The blast is said to have taken place underground the nuclear test site of Punggye-ri, in the east of country. The test site had even secured its own spot on Google maps back in 2013, though visitors are unlikely to see a sign leading to Nuclear Test Road and the positive reviews for “orange chicken” and “loud bangs” are to be taken with a rather large pinch of salt. Are we looking at an H-bomb? Probably not “The first H-bomb test was successfully conducted in the DPRK at 10:00 on Wednesday, Juche 105 (2016), pursuant to the strategic determination of the WPK (The Korean Worker’s Party),” read a triumphant statement from state media outlet KCNA. But the claim was robustly questioned by international nuclear experts. According to Lassina Zerbo, who heads the international agency tasked with measuring nuclear reactions, all signs indicated – in terms of location and magnitude – that it was a test on a similar scale to one launched by the regime in 2013. If it was a hydrogen bomb the ripple felt by the explosion would be bigger, though the ultimate aim is to make the actual weapon smaller, explained the BBC. Another possibility is that the weapon is a hybrid, “a boosted fission”, a standard fission weapon spiked with isotopes like hydrogen or lithium, said the New Scientist. In other words: a step towards a usable nuclear missile. According to nuclear expert John Carlson, the North Koreans are aiming to develop something “small enough and light enough to put on to a missile ... less than one metre in diameter, and less than a tonne in weight”. Whether they have that capacity is another subject of speculation. Why don’t we know yet? Some readers asked why – with the level of technology available to North Korean observers – we couldn’t tell immediately what type of bomb North Korea had detonated? Zerbo shared a step-by-step video explaining how his team at the preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (Ctbto) detect explosions by tracking “blast waves” that take place on, above or – in the case of North Korea – inside the Earth. And it’s not easy. Underground explosions are the “tough ones” to measure according to the video, but are monitored using the same technology that detect earthquakes. Previous “unusual disturbances” detected beneath North Korea have all turned out to be nuclear tests. This information is then combined with data from detectors monitoring the air for radioactive gasses, which use advanced weather technology. Zerbo estimated that it could take up to 72 hours for such particles to reach their monitoring stations in Japan and Russia. Scientists may then be able to determine whether a hydrogen bomb was involved. Japan and the US were also reported to have dispatched sniffer planes to search for radioactive material. How dangerous is Kim Jong-un? The significance of the date, two days before Kim Jong-un’s 33rd birthday, did not go unnoticed by many North Korean watchers, and readers wanted to know how dangerous the young dictator might be to global stability. While countries from Sweden to South Korea, Russia to the US joined the international chorus of condemnation – and Nato accused North Korea of undermining global security – the jury is still out as to whether they are any more dangerous as a nuclear power. A fourth nuclear test has been expected for a while – with some predicting that it would coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party on 10 October 2015 – but there had been no indication that the leader would press the button today. There was not a flicker of it in Kim’s New Year’s address, for example. By deploying the element of surprise Kim was able to reaffirm his “reputation as a dangerous maverick and international outlaw”, wrote the Guardian’s Simon Tisdall. It could be attention-seeking; the prelude to a new offer of normalisation talks driven by domestic weakness, or simply Kim’s idea of birthday fun, he concluded. Either way Beijing, formerly Pyongyang’s closest ally, stands to be the most perturbed. They were not given advanced warning of the test, and indicated that they would support UN action. But they have a dilemma: they do not want to throw delicate diplomatic relations out the window, and if they apply too much pressure they risk the consequences of full economic meltdown on their doorstep. What can we do? Even if it is an H-bomb, can the world do anything but dish out condemnation, asked some. As with the response to the tests of 2006, 2009 and 2013, the UN is considering punitive sanctions but Korean specialist Andrei Lankov argued that this would merely result in depriving the elite of their “Hennessey cognac and Godiva chocolate”. The country would not give up its nuclear weapons, which would be “tantamount to collective suicide”. “The only hope might be some kind of negotiations, which are ostensibly aimed at resulting in the eventual denuclearisation of North Korea but in actuality limited to negotiating a freeze of the nuclear program,” he added. What about the North Koreans? Others raised concerns about the plight of the ordinary North Korean people, but with no independent media operating inside the dictatorship it is impossible to get a true sense of national feeling beyond the state media propaganda images of jubilant celebrations in Pyongyang’s Central square. Elsewhere, tour companies said they expected to keep taking western tourists in to the country as normal. “The only things that have caused tours to be cancelled in the last few years have been Sars in 2003, and Ebola in 2014-2015. The nuclear tests previously haven’t had any effect on tourism,” said Simon Cockrell of Koryo Tours, who was planning to leave for Pyongyang today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/19/areva-shares-plunge-suspension-financial-targets-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-19T16:14:07Z","webTitle":"Shares in French nuclear group Areva plunge on financial target suspension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/19/areva-shares-plunge-suspension-financial-targets-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/19/areva-shares-plunge-suspension-financial-targets-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Shares in French nuclear group Areva plunge on financial target suspension","bodyText":"Shares in Areva – one of the companies at the heart of Britain’s planned nuclear renaissance – plunged 16% on Wednesday after the company warned it was suspending its financial targets for the next two years. The French engineering business, which is a shareholder and designer in the Hinkley Point C scheme in Somerset, blamed continuing delays to a flagship atomic power project in Finland, Olkiluoto 3, and a wider slowdown in nuclear work for its difficulties. It said it was facing “market conditions which remain unfavourable” and was conducting a strategic review. Industry analysts believe Areva, which is largely owned by the French state, may need to raise more money after reporting a series of financial losses in recent years. Luc Oursel, the chief executive, stepped down last month for health reasons while Areva has been badly hit by delays at new atomic power stations it has designed in France and Finland. Areva is working with fellow French business EDF to build the plant at Hinkley Point, but interest in nuclear work has declined since the Fukushima explosion in 2011. The Japanese accident encouraged countries such as Germany to abandon plans for new plants while the domestic market in France has also been hit by uncertainty.

Careful what you wish for, 5 February) slams Germany for increasing its CO2 emissions last year by 5% – but he fails to look at the bigger picture. Germany is embarking on a radical \"energy turnaround\". With such a massive project, some negative outcomes are to be expected while this huge ship changes course. However, if all goes to plan, Germany should become Europe's flagship for a new social framework which has energy sustainability at his core. And despite current emission levels, the country is still on track to reach its 80% carbon reduction target by 2050. Under massive popular pressure, the German government decided to end its nuclear programme on moral grounds: it was simply unethical to put its people under threat from a Fukushima-type disaster. It is now pouring billions into research and development of energy that is both renewable and safe. Meanwhile it is installing bridging technologies like combined heat and power to gradually reduce its carbon output. In other words, it has a clear roadmap. What do we have in the UK? A government that is blindly resurrecting dodgy old technologies like nuclear as well as introducing new horrors such as fracking. In times of great social upheaval we need leaders and commentators with their eyes firmly fixed on long-terms goals that are underpinned by strong ethical foundations. Camilla Berens Kick Nuclear • Nuclear power is for electricity only and incorporates, like coal power, 35% inefficient steam turbines. Lack of satisfactory nuclear waste disposal strangles the nuclear process, as does its expense and proliferation dangers. To abate climate change and other pollution, fossil fuels should stay underground, where their carbon disposal has already been accomplished. Renewables produce electricity, heat and fuels with proven technology and no additional carbon emissions – for ever. Clearly the priority is to build more renewables plant matched to dramatically improved energy-use efficiency. Let us not be distracted by outmoded dreams. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire • It is hard to see how the UK's future electricity demand and energy security can be met without an element of new nuclear power, to replace some of the existing nuclear stations as they come to the end of their lives. In considering the recently published figures for the Sellafield clean-up (MPs lambast Sellafield management firm, 4 February) it is worth remembering that a large proportion of the costs have arisen as a result of the early military programmes conceived and undertaken under time pressure and under the dark shadow of the nuclear arms race – when future waste management was not accorded the priority it now is. If new civil nuclear electricity generating capacity is commissioned in the UK, waste management and end-of-life decommissioning will be taken properly into account from the start, and so will be less expensive to deal with than the historic legacy of early military programmes. Dr Simon Harrison Institution of Engineering and Technology • Revelling in his glumness over turbines in the landscape, Simon Hoggart (2 February) says \"as a means of generating energy they are nearly hopeless\". I'll forgive him his emotions but won't let him off with the technical tosh. Wind turbines work. They generally pay back the energy that was used to build them in less than a year. After that they go on, year after year, displacing gas and coal. At one point in September 10% of the UK's electricity was from wind. Not bad for a technology that scarcely existed in this form 20 years ago! Of course there are space limits on land, which is why so many are involved in the harder challenge of taking these successful machines offshore. Jamie Taylor Edinburgh • If Simon Hoggart is correct in describing belief in the effectiveness of wind turbines as \"essentially religious\", there are a lot of essentially religious people about, including millions of Chinese. China has begun a massive programme of investment in wind energy. The British, as ever, fall behind other countries when it comes to capitalising on technological advances they may have themselves begun.

Professor Robert Duck from the University of Dundee says that numerous sections of railway in Wales, Cumbria, Devon and elsewhere are at risk of being washed away because they skirt so close to the sea. Three lines had to close in 2014 after being damaged by waves, most memorably at Dawlish on the south coast of Devon where the track was left hanging in mid-air. Trains on some of the vulnerable coastal tracks carry nuclear waste to the Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria and from the Wylfa nuclear site in north Wales. They are also vital lifelines for hundreds of communities. Duck is the author of a new book on UK coastal railways called ‘On the Edge’ to be launched on Thursday. It points out that over 93 miles (150km) of the operating railway network in Wales are on the coast, along with many other stretches around England and Scotland. The seawall protecting the railway at Dawlish was destroyed in February 2014 and the line was out of action for two months. “This was a dramatic example of the problems we face as climate change leads to more storms and exacerbates coastal erosion,” says Duck. “Much of our coast has railway lines at the edge forming the first line of defence from the sea. This leads to spectacular scenery for passengers to enjoy but increasing difficulties for franchise operators and government.” For railway builders in the mid-19th century the coast was cheaper, flatter and easier than using inland sites, he points out. “We wouldn’t have built these railway lines where they are if we had today’s knowledge.” One of the most vulnerable lines runs along the Cambrian coast in northwest Wales. Winter storms in January 2014 damaged the track in several places between Machynlleth, Barmouth and Pwllheli, and took five months to repair. Ballast and earth supporting 200 metres of railway line at Flimby, to the north of Workington in Cumbria, were also washed away by high tides and strong winds in January 2014. It is on the coastal line between Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness that carries highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power stations to the Sellafield reprocessing plant. Another line at risk runs close to the north Wales shore from Chester to Holyhead. It connects with Wylfa on Anglesey where there is an ageing nuclear power station, and contested proposals to build a new one. Duck, a professor of environmental geoscience at Dundee, warns that hard engineering solutions for protecting coastal railways may become too expensive. “The time will come when we have to look at alternatives, building inland diversions and re-opening long-closed lines as a way of ensuring that we do not cut off communities,” he says. Edinburgh rail consultant, David Spaven, agreed that diversions might work in some places but in others there were major engineering challenges. “It’s ironic that climate change, which should generally mean a bright future for energy-efficient rail transport, also threatens the integrity of coastal routes,” he said. Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining the railways, accepted that coastal lines were vulnerable to extreme weather. “That’s why we spend millions each year protecting the railway from nature’s worst attacks,” said a company spokeswoman. “We’ve published a series of route-based weather resilience and climate change plans which explain our understanding of how weather can affect the railway and the potential impact of changes in our climate. We explain what we’re doing to mitigate the impacts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2015/dec/17/public-participation-science-technology-failure-to-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Public participation in science and technology: why the failure to launch?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/dec/17/public-participation-science-technology-failure-to-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2015/dec/17/public-participation-science-technology-failure-to-launch","fields":{"headline":"Public participation in science and technology: why the failure to launch?","bodyText":"For good reason the desire for public involvement in science and policy making has become something of an obsession, whether in the corridors of the recent Paris COP21 meeting, in debates over energy policy and fracking, or in the everyday practice of science. While there has been an explosion of activity and some notable successes in expanding the number of people involved in addressing today’s pressing global challenges, we see a continued focus on a few rather rigid models of participation. Initiatives repeatedly invite members of the public into rooms to deliberate over our common future, attempt to capture public sentiment about scientific issues through polls or surveys, or try to nudge citizens to adopt behaviours in line with a future that has already been largely determined. For example, at the COP21 negotiations in Paris, attempts to feed in the views of over 10,000 global citizens through the World Wide Views on Climate and Energy initiative - purported to be largest ever global citizen consultation on climate and energy - sat alongside commitments to promote behaviour change. The same dynamics are evident in UK energy policy. Publics are repeatedly surveyed or invited to deliberate issues like fracking, while at the same time being encouraged to adopt behaviours that reduce or shift patterns of energy demand. Yet such approaches have largely failed to dampen controversies over issues such as fracking, biofuels or nuclear power, or to mobilise the sort of wider social change needed to tackle climate change. It seems we now have a citizenry that is more engaged with science and technology than ever before, but whose voices are increasingly distant from centres of political power and authority. The myth of a singular ‘general public’ persists despite signs that long established methods of engagement struggle to handle the social complexities of an increasingly globalized and cosmopolitan but also fragmented and unequal world. This has been dramatically demonstrated, for example, by the failure of exit polling to predict actual voting practices in the last UK general election, or by the many instances of deliberative consultations being subject to legal challenge. In our new book, Remaking Participation – which brings together leading thinkers writing on science and democracy today – we argue that the field of public participation in science and democracy has lost its way and needs to be fundamentally reimagined. This means letting go of the fiction that any one method of engagement can definitively represent ‘the public’. It means overthrowing dominant visions of public participation as discrete one-off events that have a linear impact on decision-making or behavioural and attitudinal change. If only things were so simple! In the book we call for a more sophisticated approach that addresses how ‘the public’, ‘stakeholders’ and forms of participation are always socially constructed and emergent. Participation never occurs in a vacuum but always in relation to many other public engagements in ‘ecologies of participation’ as part of wider democratic systems (think of the diverse ways in which people engage with an issue like climate change, over many scales, on any given day). Attending to the continual emergence of diverse participating publics in climate change, energy or any other issue demands more experimental and responsible approaches. Four moves in particular are urgently needed: Celebrate diversities of participation by mapping, and understanding relationships between, the many ways in which publics engage with issues. For example, better understanding public views on fracking depends on mapping the diverse ways in which people relate to this emerging technology – including in community meetings, on social media and through active protest and activism – rather than simply relying on opinion polls and deliberative consultation events. Experimental participation which includes an acute awareness of how public participants, their views, and forms of engagement continually emerge through the conduct of participation, and how they are framed in powerful ways. When it comes to debates over unconventional gas and oil, for example, such an approach would reveal that public concerns are rooted just as much in questions of directionality, control and equity. That is: to where technologies like fracking are likely to take us (more fossil fuel dependency in a centralised energy system, for example) and who stands to benefit from the shale gas rush, rather than simply ‘back-end’ risks to people and the environment. Responsible participation. Much has been written about how to make science, innovation and business more socially responsible, but a more careful approach to innovations in democratic engagement is needed - one that can anticipate and respond to their possible downsides, ethical issues and social implications. This is particularly important as a public engagement industry becomes commercialised throughout the world. Turning participation around. For too long the burden of participation in science and democracy has been placed on citizens to come forward and engage. This is of course crucial, but only half right. Global citizens have had to dance to the tune of science and policy-makers on issues like climate change, genetically modified food and energy. It is time for this to be turned around. The burden of participation should lie just as much with powerful science, state and market institutions. We should be able to expect that these institutions be open about their own assumptions, values and vested interests, and transparent and candid in the ways in which they account for the relevance of diverse public engagements. In short, relying on ‘sound science’, the false promises of grand techno-fixes, or more deliberative democracy will not be enough to tackle complex societal challenges like climate change and energy. To make the necessary breakthroughs we need to fundamentally remake participation, for the sake of the environment and humanity.

Chris Patten, who was the last British governor of Hong Kong and a former chair of the BBC Trust, said he was surprised by what Osborne was doing and saying on his five-day trip last month, where he announced a deal with China to finance and build nuclear power stations in the UK. In an interview with the Guardian, Patten said he did not believe David Cameron had “departed very far from traditional Tory instincts” but “the jury’s out” on Osborne.On the chancellor’s China trip, he said: “There was a danger that the Treasury would be allowed to get away with the argument that ‘soft power’ doesn’t include regard for human rights and civil liberties around the world. These ideas weren’t always regarded as so off the wall.” Patten, one of the UK’s foremost lay Catholics, who has been advising the Vatican on its communications, said it was not unreasonable for church leaders to criticise government policy, following pre-election statements made by Church of England bishops and Catholic leaders. “If church leaders don’t speak out on issues like immigration or poverty, they can’t have read the gospels. I’m extremely relaxed about them speaking out on these sort of issues, which all of us should be concerned about.” An open letter from Britain’s C of E bishops before the general election attacked the “growing appetite to exploit grievances” and “find scapegoats” in society and called for “a fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be”. Last year, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic church in England and Wales, said the government’s austerity programme was a disgrace and its welfare reforms were punitive. Patten said the Catholic church must be more in tune with “the way people live their lives” in the real world. He said a much more open debate about issues such as divorce, cohabitation, contraception and same-sex relationships was needed or the church risked damage from the disjuncture between its “magisterium” (or teaching authority) and the realities of life. His comments came as the Vatican embarked on a historic summit on family issues, which pits church conservatives against progressives in a concentrated version of a battle that is being played out globally among the Catholic church’s 1.2 billion followers. It is expected to consider whether divorced Catholics should be allowed to take communion and whether to be more open to homosexuality. Urging church leaders to adjust their positions, Patten said: “If you look at the figures for cohabitation, single parents, divorce and so on, you see a big disjuncture between what the church says and the way people behave, not just for non-Catholics, but Catholics as well.” One of Patten’s grandsons was being prepared for his first communion, he said, and often parents were encouraged to take communion with their child. “What do you do with kids in the class whose parents are divorced and aren’t allowed to take communion? What do you tell those eight and nine-year-olds? That their parents are living in sin, that their parents are wicked?” He hoped that “wisdom and sense and forgiveness” would come from the Vatican’s synod on the family. Patten observed the institutions of the Vatican close up when he was invited to lead a review of its media strategy last year, delivering his recommendations in April. He proposed measures to improve efficiency in the €70m (£52m) media operation, which employs more than 600 staff, and greater engagement with digital communication and social media. Patten said he would have liked to oversee implementation of his proposals, “but probably for the Vatican this was a bridge too far. There are limits to their enthusiasm for outsiders.” Despite Pope Francis’s commitment to modernising Vatican institutions – which, Patten admitted, “haven’t been hugely transparent over the years” – there was some resistance in Rome. “Like any bureaucracy, it builds up patterns of behaviour which tend to repel rather than welcome change.” Francis was an extraordinary pope, Patten said, combining “natural humility with fierce intelligence – and at the same time is likeable and funny, and does the things you’d want a pastor to do.

The push on nuclear came as part of a major announcement on £100bn in public funding for capital projects such as road, rail and energy infrastructure that the government hopes will stimulate the ailing economy. The plans set out by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, included more than £70bn of investment in transport, over £20bn in schools and £10bn in science, housing and flood defences. Government sources said the public funding to support the £14bn Hinkley Point project did not represent a subsidy to nuclear power since the guarantees would be offered at a commercial rate. The offer, which is subject to negotiation with the energy giant EDF, will bring a deal on the guaranteed prices between EDF and government closer to fruition. Announcing long-term capital spending until the end of the decade, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, also unveiled plans for a major road-building programme as well as an affordable housing programme. The National Housing Federation said the £3bn spending promised over the next two years was deeply disappointing in light of previous cuts. Alexander claimed the government had already built 84,000 affordable homes, and the new money would lead to a further 165,000 homes being built. The Treasury chief secretary also announced the prices for renewable generation including onshore and offshore wind, tidal, wave, biomass and solar. He said the prices were broadly similar to those the UK government pays under the existing Renewables Obligation. He said the reforms would bring forward 8-16 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity. The five-year time horizon of the capital project also binds the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives together in an agreed capital spending plan for the next parliament. The two parties refused to come to such a joint agreement on current spending, only agreeing a deal for 2015-16. The scale of the spending announcement was described by Labour as \"hilarious hyperbole\", pointing out that the spending represented no increase on what had been promised for 2015-16 in the spring budget. They also claimed experience had shown the government had been unable to translate grand infrastructure plans into reality on the ground. Much of the extra capital spending will be funded by a £15bn sell-off of public assets by 2020 including the £10bn student loan book and £5bn in land and property. The Treasury No 2 also announced he had accepted the recommendation of Lord Deighton that crucial infrastructure delivery be taken out of the hands of civil servants and given instead to commercial experts. Other funding commitments include the go-ahead for HS2, a new nationwide rail network that will put two-thirds of northern England within two hours of London. Alexander claimed the commitment to roads was the biggest since the 1970s. By 2020-21 the government plans to triple the money spent on roads compared with 2013. Overall, he said the government would invest £28bn over the six years from 2014 in enhancements and maintenance of national and local roads. This includes £6bn to help local authorities repair the local road network. Superfast broadband provision will be expanded so 95% of UK premises will have access by 2017. Alexander also presented the outline of a deal with the insurance industry designed to help 500,000 homes at risk of flooding. But he also announced plans to regulate affordable flood insurance should that prove necessary. That will be done through amendments to the water bill, he said. Alexander also announced a further £600m in the regional growth fund. Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Infrastructure projects are too often promised and too rarely delivered in this country, and that cycle must be broken. \"If these announcements are to translate into short-term confidence, medium-term construction jobs and long-term competitiveness, the Whitehall machine must be judged by the number of diggers on the ground, not strategies and press notices.\" Ian Brinkley, director of the Work Foundation, said: \"If there is a sound economic argument to invest more in social housing and road maintenance from 2016-17 onwards, it must make just as much sense to invest in these projects from 2014-15 onwards. Giving local authorities the means to tackle the poor repair of our roads now will create many 'shovel ready' projects, generating much-needed jobs in construction and related sectors, and help save future maintenance bills.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/aug/24/labour-tom-watson-tory-minister-bullish-on-china","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-24T15:04:26Z","webTitle":"Labour's Tom Watson attacks Tory minister over 'bullish on China' article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/24/labour-tom-watson-tory-minister-bullish-on-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/aug/24/labour-tom-watson-tory-minister-bullish-on-china","fields":{"headline":"Labour's Tom Watson attacks Tory minister over 'bullish on China' article","bodyText":"A Treasury minister who is one of George Osborne’s closest advisers has been criticised by a Labour MP for dismissing fears that the Chinese stock market was “dangerously overvalued”. Jim O’Neill, the minister for infrastructure and retired chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, wrote in January that the Chinese economy would rebalance itself and said “eternal bears” who feared for the country’s fiscal stability were wrong. On Monday European stocks tumbled and the US Dow Jones index plunged 1,000 points within minutes of opening after Chinese shares had their worst day since 2007, intensifying a stock market rout driven by fears about the world’s second-biggest economy. Tom Watson, the favourite to become Labour’s deputy leader, said Osborne should explain why Lord O’Neill should be the minister in charge of infrastructure projects including the Northern Powerhouse. “In January, Jim O’Neill, one of [Osborne’s] closest economic advisers, the man he installed in the House of Lords and put in charge of the nation’s infrastructure, dismissed the ‘eternal bears’ who said the Chinese stock market was dangerously overvalued and being propped up by artificial means,” he said. “He heralded the strength of the Shanghai Composite Index and said he remained ‘bullish on China’. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen by nearly 30% since June, with potentially serious ramifications for the global economy.” Watson, the MP for West Bromwich East, also raised questions about the stability of major projects that Chinese corporations were looking to invest in, including nuclear power stations and railways. “The UK is dependent on China for £100bn of infrastructure investment over the next decade. George Osborne has appointed O’Neill as his commercial secretary with responsibility for the so-called Northern Powerhouse, for Britain’s industrial strategy, and for attracting overseas investment in UK infrastructure. “The chancellor should tell us why he thinks a minister who has got it so badly wrong on China has been placed in charge of so much else the country needs to get right.” O’Neill was given a peerage and a top job in the Treasury in May, when he took over as minister of infrastructure from the former Locog chief executive Paul Deighton. In January O’Neill wrote in the Business Standard: “Many international commentators remain bearish about China, expecting real GDP growth to slip significantly below 7%. The reasons cited usually involve some combination of excessive debt, inefficient lending, weaker export markets and consumers’ ongoing inability to play a bigger role in the economy. “I can think of at least three basic reasons to be bullish on China. First, the collapse of crude oil prices will boost consumers’ real incomes, helping them play a larger role in the economy. Second, even though property prices have recently stalled and begun to fall, China will probably avoid a serious credit crunch, partly because Chinese policymakers have been more serious about restraining prices. A third reason to be optimistic is the subdued nature of inflation in China.” He went on: “Taken together, these factors will make it easier for China to rebalance its economy – by raising wages, increasing property ownership rights for urban migrants and reforming pension systems. In 2016, when China – with its economy growing at 6 to 7% – chairs the Group of 20 nations, it can do so as a fully engaged member of the global economy.” Perhaps best known for coining the acronym Bric to describe the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, O’Neill spent 15 years at Goldman. He stepped down as chairman of the bank’s asset management business this year.

In her speech at the Buckingham Palace banquet in Xi’s honour, the Queen noted that the two countries shared the distinction of being permanent members of the UN security council and therefore “have a responsibility to cooperate on these issues which have a direct bearing on the security and prosperity of all our peoples”. In fact, what was striking about the week-long bilateral coupling was the absence of public discussion of the geopolitical crises of the day such as Syria or Ukraine or the South China Sea, where the impasse in the security council has left the international community powerless to respond. That vacuum would be unthinkable if David Cameron had been meeting any other leader from the security council’s five permanent members. The gold in the promised “golden decade” is not a metaphor for anything. When it comes to the UK and China it just means cold hard cash. Cameron’s former chief strategist Steve Hilton derided his former employer for “sucking up to China”. He declared the visit “one of the worst national humiliations since we went cap in hand to the IMF in the 70s”. And after a passing cyclist, a lawyer called Paul Powlesland, got into an argument with Xi supporters about human rights, declaring that “many English people are frankly disgusted” with the government’s supine approach”, a video of the discussion went viral and was viewed more than half a million times, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The public thirst for a debate on the issue was a reflection of its absence from official discussions during the Xi visit. However, these were voices off, kept well away from the main stage. British diplomats have argued privately that there could be indirect strategic benefits of economic interdependence for the UK. Perhaps Britain could eventually exert greater leverage on China, and perhaps, somewhere down the line, it could help peel China away from its tight relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia on some global issues before the security council. There was little in the course of the Xi visit to give credence to such hopes. From start to finish, China showed itself to be the dominant partner in the relationship. That was apparent in the opening moments, when Beijing displayed its mastery of mass mobilisation, filling the Mall with cheering supporters outfitted with flags and banners from the Chinese embassy, swamping out human rights protests that were meagre by comparison. The technique was repeated again and again at each event through the week. In his reply to the one direct question he was obliged to face on human rights, from the BBC, Xi said China had “room for improvement”, but behind the scenes Chinese officials made clear that China had its own view of what human rights meant. “Our goal is to pull 10 million people out of poverty every year, and we have to maintain social stability in order to do that,” a senior official said, adding that if it was necessary to block internet news sites to keep that stability intact, so be it. “That is the central part of our attempt to achieve human rights.” When Xi officiated at the opening of a Confucius Institute conference in London to promote the teaching of the Mandarin language, the embassy changed the agenda to include the recitation of a poem the president had written in 1990. It was a paean of praise to a traditional Communist hero called Jiao Yulu, a party leader from Henan province celebrated on a million propaganda posters for putting the needs of the ordinary working people before his own. In style and substance, Xi showed himself to be an unreconstructed, old-school party boss. If any leverage resulted from the deals done over the course of the week, it is more likely to be Beijing’s leverage on the UK, through investment in infrastructure and in particular the UK’s nuclear energy sector Justin Harvey, the chief security officer for the US-based Fidelis Cybersecurity consultants, said there was shock in America about the nuclear deal. “You just don’t mess with nuclear power,” Harvey said. “In this relationship, China has nothing to lose but the UK has everything to lose.” He said that if current tensions over China’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea turned into open confrontation, the UK might find itself having to choose between its traditional US ally and a nation that holds significant stakes in its own infrastructure. Harvey said: “You never know when today’s best friend is going to turn into tomorrow’s worst enemy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/nov/06/waiting-for-the-past-les-murray-review-poetry-collection","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-06T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Waiting for the Past by Les Murray review – matter-of-fact extravagance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/06/waiting-for-the-past-les-murray-review-poetry-collection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/nov/06/waiting-for-the-past-les-murray-review-poetry-collection","fields":{"headline":"Waiting for the Past by Les Murray review – matter-of-fact extravagance","bodyText":"Serious consideration of the gifts reserved for age is likely to be sobering. Les Murray does not deny it. Waiting for the Past takes in vertigo, sudden falls, diabetes, frequent night visits to the lavatory while “trying not to dot the floor // with little advance pees”. He writes of cancer as it was suffered in the days when it could scarcely be named, along with the question of care for the elderly – among whom he now numbers himself: Carers are fifteen years younger than you. They stop in for your boy, they shower your mother not looking, they unpeg and bring in the laundry. Carers have learned the bad- smelling jobs, and soak them as they chat. Like all Murray’s collections this one is dedicated “to the glory of God”, but there is no spiritual snobbery or filtering for suitably improving subjects: Murray speaks as he finds. If this can put him in a strangely reactionary position at times, it also signals his fidelity to the lives of the New South Wales farming people and other workers among whom he grew up and among whom he continues to belong. In “Growth” he recalls from childhood the last days of his maternal grandmother, who was: accomplishing her hard death on that strange farm miles away. My mother was nursing her so we couldn’t be at home. Dad had to stay out there, milking, appearing sometimes, with his people, all waiting for the past. That extraordinary, many-faceted last line is set in place as though it were the plainest sense because it is delivered in plain language. Murray has remained in faithful proximity to speech, however complex the material may be. This fidelity seems to speak for a vocation of service rather than the desire for honour, power, riches, fame and love that Freud attributed to the artist. When Murray writes about a doomed steelworks it must seem timely to readers in Britain, who see a government unwilling to invest in saving Redcar yet prepared to bribe the Chinese to the tune of billions to build a nuclear power station. In the works the glare of the furnace is “intense as a searchlight / infinitely confined”, and: The scorched hook-steerers down in the spatter spend crib-times heel-and-toeing a new ferrous patter on sheets of cooled plate since these works will soon close and spangling metal will set in black floes. The density of the material (both actual and verbal) is accommodated by the plainness of the sentence structure. When reading aloud, where some poets aim for glory, Murray can sound almost impatient of his own work, and in these lines the eventual resolving rhythm has to make a case for itself among solid, intransigent objects. It is almost but not quite too much. Murray can also work with a much greater liquidity of movement. “I Wrote a Little Haiku” describes Minié balls, fired from the Springfield rifles used by both sides in the American civil war, melting when the wood in which they have long been embedded is burned: the bullet that tore often wet with blood and sera into the farmyard timbers and forests of that era, wood that, burnt even now, might still re-melt and pour out runs of silvery ichor the size of wasted semen it had annulled before. “Annulled” is a startling and completely apt choice here: the slight remoteness of the Latinate word helps to avoid the moral insistence that can disarm poetry about war. We receive “annul” from the French annuller, which here plays off a secondary meaning (futurity) of “sera” to suggest marriages ended or as yet unmade, and children never to be born. Murray has always had metaphysical interests, but sometimes he is also a metaphysical poet in method, and in this role shows how poetry can do things largely beyond the compass of other literary forms. Here, for example, he makes etymology into a mode of revelation. Not all of Waiting for the Past operates at this level of distinction: there are a few poems that feel like products of artistic habit, as is perhaps inevitable in a poet as prolific as Murray. But time after time we encounter that familiar convergence of artistic authority and modesty of tone that in turn produces the matter-of-fact extravagance that has made earlier poems such as “The Dream of Wearing Shorts Forever” and “The Quality of Sprawl” so well loved. It has been the fate of many poets to find that the world is at once too much and not enough, to be driven to suicide and madness, or to the creation of hermetic works or mythologies, secondary worlds that overlay or displace the unaccommodating original. We might say that Murray’s Catholic faith serves as a mythology whose scope he sees as requiring no adjustment. What we definitely can say is that the world Murray renders is close at hand even for the remotest reader. It is completely lived in. It is handled, worked, scented, mapped, celebrated, lamented, and its people honoured in both presence and memory. Murray’s way is not the only way, but it is a wonderful achievement. • Sean O’Brien’s The Beautiful Librarians is published by Picador.

The technology giant said on Wednesday that it would open its 14th data centre inside the grounds of the old coal plant, and had reached a deal with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the region’s power company, to supply the project with renewable sources of electricity. With the coal plant rehab, Google solidifies a reputation among tech companies for promoting clean energy. “It’s very important symbolism to take an old coal plant that is a relic of the old energy system and convert it into a data centre that will be powered by renewable energy,” said David Pomerantz, climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace. Michael Terrell, who leads energy market strategy for Google’s infrastructure team, said the company saw clear benefits in taking over the old coal facility. “There is an enormous opportunity when you take over the infrastructure that is there – the transmissions lines and the water intakes – and use that to power a data centre that is powered by renewable energy,” he said. Outside utilities, Google claims to be the largest user of renewable energy in the US. The company says it uses 1.5% of wind power capacity in the US, and has plans to bring in more alternatives over the next year. However, the company overall still treads with a relatively heavy carbon footprint compared to Apple. About 46% of Google’s data centers are powered by renewable energy. Apple’s in contrast are powered 100% by clean energy, according to Greenpeace. Google is committed to going 100% renewable, but has no target date. Google went into the renewable energy business earlier with data centres in Iowa and Oklahoma. However, the company still has three data centres in south-eastern states which rely heavily on coal and nuclear power, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Pomerantz said the move into Alabama was so encouraging because it challenged that dominance. The company said it would be working directly with TVA to bring more wind power into the grid. “We see a lot of value in redeveloping big industrial sites like this. There is a lot of electric and other infrastructure that we can re-use,” Matt Kalman, a Google spokesman said in an email. Google is also rehabbing old industrial facilities overseas. The company repurposed an old paper mill in Finland for use of a data centre. It has already done a solar project in South Africa, and is scouting out other ways of producing clean energy cheaply. The Alabama power plant has been generating power since 1952, but was slated to wind down later this year, in part because of incoming environmental regulations, the TVA said on its website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-boss-nigel-cann","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-20T20:07:00Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: the colossus Whitehall wants but is struggling to believe in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-boss-nigel-cann","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-boss-nigel-cann","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: the colossus Whitehall wants but is struggling to believe in","bodyText":"Nigel Cann has a big job on. A director of EDF Energy, it is his job to deliver the biggest construction project in Europe: the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is needed as soon as possible to help keep Britain’s lights on, and is a project with vast commercial and political capital riding on it. Experience suggests that the construction of the first nuclear reactor constructed in Britain for quarter of a century – located on the Somerset coast – will not be straightforward. Similar projects in France and Finland have run into huge delays and cost overruns. This week EDF has put back the completion date of its newbuild project at Flamanville in Normandy while Areva, another Hinkley shareholder and the designer of the reactors, has admitted it may need a financial bailout. Fortunately, Cann is a confident kind of chap. He insists he is not overly daunted by Hinkley and its £25bn price tag – the equivalent of putting on almost three London Olympics. “I grew up around the Channel Tunnel rail project. Everyone admired those ‘tunnel tigers’, as they were known, and I want to create the same atmosphere around here.” It is, he says, “an honour and a challenge to have this responsibility, but I also feel humble,” adding: “I do not underestimate the job. This is the biggest single foreign investment in this country since world war two.” So what makes him think that EDF and its partner Areva can deliver a working power station in Britain by 2023 – something they have individually or collectively failed to do on time and on budget with similar European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) at Flamanville and Olkiluoto in Finland? “We spend a lot of time reviewing these other projects and finding out what we can learn from them. We have workshops centred on what went wrong. I admit that some of what I have read is quite ugly. “There has been a lack of attention to detail in places, some miscommunications. We do a lot of scenario-based training on issues such as the quality of concrete, which was an issue at Olkiluoto. But all the parties are sharing their experiences with us and learning is in our DNA.” EDF is also taking experience gained from the 2012 Olympics and Heathrow Terminal 5 – signing early agreements with trade unions, using “mock-up” sites to practise construction techniques as well as utilising prefabricated and modular parts. Cann is sitting in a glorified portable cabin that acts as a viewing gallery, his shirt sleeves rolled up as if ready to start digging himself. Outside, the rain spatters down on massive yellow earthmoving equipment lumbering around mountains of chocolate-coloured earth. The French company has around 400 people already at work clearing a 175-hectare site next door to Hinkley Point A and B, the first being decommissioned, the latter still operating. Cann’s team is also putting in place roads and roundabouts including a bypass round the small village of Canning so that locals will be saved some of the inconvenience of the 750 trucks a day that will go in an out of the Hinkley site. EDF spent £5m during September alone on Hinkley Point C, whose generous subsidy regime has just been given the all-clear by Brussels, but EDF has yet to make a final investment decision. This will almost certainly come early in the new year. Cann, who previously ran Hinkley Point B and before that another nuclear plant at Dungeness in his native Kent, admits the new job is different. “People think there is not very much going on here yet. But it does not feel that way to me. It is different from going into an existing plant. There is very little structure to start with, and you have got to create it. It is very important to be focused on safety, quality and control. That is really easy to talk about but much harder to do.” Only 60% of the Somerset project is nuclear – the remaining 40% is conventional work, such as building a sea wall and a jetty to bring in aggregates for construction, plus drilling tunnels for cooling pipelines going out to sea. One of the key issues for Cann, he says, is to make sure the local community – and Britain more widely – takes as much as it can out of the project, especially in the way of jobs and services. Critics often suggest that these kinds of colossal projects, especially those run by foreign firms, simply suck in skilled foreign workers at the expense of local, and even nuclear experts have repeatedly warned about British skill shortages. By the end of next year, he expects to have 2,000 workers on site, moving up to 5,600 at peak time, and Cann is aiming for 24% of recruits to come from Somerset and 34% from within a 90-mile radius. So far, he says, he is beating those targets. He also hopes to train 400 apprentices while procuring nearly 60% of the entire project from a UK supply chain. “We have had fantastic support from the Somerset chamber of commerce,” he says. “To give one example, we have already seen a local food co-op, the Somerset Larder, set up in preparation for feeding what we estimate to be the 25,000 people who will move through the site over the lifetime of the scheme. But we want to make sure that all this is sustainable, with a wider group of customers beyond HPC [Hinkley Point C], so that that activity continues after the project is complete.” Nevertheless, Cann faces a truckload of scepticism. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is reviewing whether the project can really be built on time, while leading energy analysts, such as Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital, believe the enormous cost and appalling track record in the nuclear industry of doing things on time mean ministers should scrap Hinkley. Flamanville was meant to be completed by 2012 and yet has just been put back till 2017. The blame for this has been put on Areva, which is also seven years behind with Olkiluoto 3. Costs for these projects have soared, and while EDF argues Hinkley will cost £16bn, the European commission has already predicted the cost will be closer to £25bn, with much of the cash coming as a subsidy regime ultimately paid for by consumers. And before the French company gives the go-ahead to the Somerset project, it also needs to finalise shareholdings in the plant. Talks are going on with a variety of potential investors, including Saudi Arabia’s electricity group, as the future of Areva remains in question. Cann is also aware that his project will compete for skilled British labour at a time when other huge schemes are under way, such as the Thames Tideway and Crossrail tunnels in London and the HS2 rail line, not to mention other nuclear plants planned by Gloucester-based rival Horizon, owned by Hitachi. “It would be naive and arrogant if we thought this was the only place in town [to work],” says Cann. “But I want people to enjoy working here safely and for them – as for me – we will get a buzz out of building a huge bit of infrastructure that will be here for 100 years. I have had a fantastic career out of nuclear and, after running three power stations, why not leave a legacy?” Power points Overseas businesses are queuing up to build nuclear capacity in the UK • EDF and Areva’s Hinkley Point C will provide power to 5m homes, delivering around 7% of the country’s electricity. • EDF and Chinese partners are also looking at building plants at Sizewell, in Suffolk, but the latter would also like to build and operate their own facilities in Britain. • Hitachi of Japan, under the banner of Horizon Nuclear Power, wants to construct plants on existing sites at Oldbury, in Gloucestershire, and Wylfa, in Anglesey, to provide 10m homes with electricity. • Toshiba has a project with GDF Suez of France to erect another atomic power station near Sellafield, Cumbria using technology provided by Westinghouse Electric, a rival to the Areva design used in EDF’s European Pressurised Reactors. • Toshiba, in combination with GE of the US, also wants to build a Prism reactor, that could generate electricity by burning high-level radioactive waste, probably again in Cumbria. • Russian group Rosatom is also keen on constructing power plants in Britain although political fallout from the Ukraine mean these plans are unlikely to progress very far in the near future. • The Russian and Chinese state-owned nuclear firms are interested in nuclear sites that have not been allocated for new projects. Moscow and Beijing see the UK as a well-regulated environment and think they can use it as a shop window for their technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jul/05/davey-minister-nuclear-power-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-05T17:22:18Z","webTitle":"Ed Davey 'will not give an inch' on nuclear power price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/05/davey-minister-nuclear-power-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jul/05/davey-minister-nuclear-power-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Ed Davey 'will not give an inch' on nuclear power price","bodyText":"The energy secretary on Saturday intervenes in the debate over nuclear power by insisting he will not budge a further inch in his offer of long-term guaranteed fixed prices for nuclear electricity. Ed Davey says he regards the negotiations as a test for his commitment to produce nuclear energy at an affordable price and without subsidy by the taxpayer. The government is locked in lengthy talks with its preferred supplier, the French energy firm EDF, over a planned nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which would be the first in almost two decades. But Davey says EDF's chief rival, Hitachi, looks willing to make an acceptable offer on price. In a Guardian interview, he described the negotiations as a personal test since as a past nuclear sceptic he had to prove he could negotiate a price that does not represent a subsidy to the industry. Davey, a key figure in the Liberal Democrats, also argued if he could strike the right deal it would be time for environmentalists, including in his own party, to rethink their approach to nuclear. Revealing a lull in the EDF talks, he said: \"My main job is to make sure that this deal works for the British consumer and for British industry. We have made a hell of a lot of progress in our negotiations but we are not there yet. We are down to one or two issues, including the actual price. I am not going to sign any deal with EDF unless it is value for money, is affordable and meets the coalition agreement of no public subsidy. These are our tests and we are going to meet them. The other side know the strike price I will agree to, and they need to know I am not going to budge an inch. This has got to work for both parties.\" He said he had already had talks with EDF's rivals: \"Sometimes people said it is EDF or bust. I would like to do a deal with EDF but we don't have to. I was in Korea and Japan recently talking to other investors and vendors. Their interest in the UK market was massive. I got the very strong impression that the sort of price I was happy to agree with EDF, they could match.\" He added: \"I am determined that the consumer or the taxpayer will not bear the risk of construction over-runs. Nuclear will get no preference in comparison with other low-carbon technologies.\" The long-delayed deal – likely to cover the price over the next 35 years – is seen as a litmus test of the affordability of nuclear power not just in the UK but across Europe. The new reactors are vital to hitting the government's long-term carbon-emission goals and maintaining electricity supply at a time of rising public anger at high energy prices, as well as fears of energy shortages. Davey needs to deliver a deal that balances low electricity for consumers, a secure national low-carbon energy supply and his party's opposition to nuclear power. His party opposed a new generation of nuclear reactors in its election manifesto but in 2010, in concert with its coalition partners, agreed it would let nuclear stations be built so long as the energy was not subsidised. In his interview Davey insisted he would stick to his party's promise. \"This is a real test for me, having made my doubts about nuclear in the past because of the price. Well, I am going to get the right price.\" He added measuring public subsidy has to take into account the right comparators, adding \"fossil fuels and gas prices are more expensive than they appear in the wholesale market\", once the true cost of carbon is taken into account. He took on the nuclear critics, telling them: \"You should worry about climate change. So many environmentalists have changed their views because of the threat of climate change and the fact that nuclear is low-carbon – James Lovelock, Mark Lynas, Professor James Hansen, George Monbiot, Stephen Tindale and the late Bishop Montefiore.\" He added: \"Fifteen nuclear reactors are closing by 2023 – that is eight gigawatts of power – so much of the new nuclear is replacing old nuclear, mainly on the sites of the old reactors. Davey last week announced that EDF Electricité de France SA (EDF.FR) would be given guarantees of up to £10bn to underwrite the loans to build the proposed plant at Hinkley Point C, so making the project more attractive to third-party investors and reducing the impact on EDF's balance sheet. He insisted that this did not represent a subsidy since the loan would be at a commercial rate. The guarantee had been seen as vital to unlocking a deal but Davey said he was waiting for EDF to reflect on his offer on the strike price, adding there was a lull in the talks. It is expected that the guaranteed fixed price for nuclear electricity will be fully linked to inflation, and last 35 years. Each power station would cost about £14bn to build. They would come onstream in 2020 and 2021, so a deal would not plug the apparent short-term gaps in the UK energy supply highlighted in recent weeks, Davey argued. \"Nuclear is not part of the short-term or medium-term security issue, so EDF does not have us over a barrel on this. In fact our hand is a lot stronger than people realise, because we have other low-carbon options. Carbon capture and storage competition is down to two preferred bidders and we will sign agreements shortly, and that competes with nuclear. The fact that we have just got our strike price for renewables also shows we have other options. \"As important, and possibly more important, we have other nuclear options. Hitachi are very live options. They bought Horizon only last year and their pace of progress is truly impressive. They have already had preliminary talks with the regulator on going ahead with an examination of their nuclear reactor design. Their boiling water reactor has been used in Taiwan and Japan. Recently they bought four reactors on time and on budget.\" The Japanese manufacturer is planning to build up to six reactors at two sites through the Horizon Nuclear Power venture it agreed to buy in October. It has been reported that EDF, the world's largest nuclear operator, seeks a strike price of £95-£100 per megawatt hour of electricity, while the government would rather settle around £80-£85. The current wholesale price is about £48/MWh. Davey simply said the figures that have appeared in the media so far are not ones he recognises. The strike price depends on a number of factors, such as the duration of the contract, the capital cost of the project and the rate of return EDF is allowed to make on it. Davey is clearly aware that the wrong deal will cause him potentially difficult political problems in the Liberal Democrats, but says the party historically has not been completely anti-nuclear. Davey told the Guardian: \"The issue has never been completely black and white in our party. It is fair to say our policy at the last election was anti-nuclear and clearly there is a majority concerned about nuclear, and that is the case in the parliamentary party. I am not going to suggest otherwise. But like all those other environmentalists, many in our party are looking at climate change and have decided that is the chief environmental threat. As a result some have become genuinely pro-nuclear. Some of that is going on in the party, but there are people like me who have always been worried about the price. That is why I hope people can be reassured to know that I will be fighting very hard on that.\" The importance of the negotiations to the UK taxpayer can hardly be underestimated. It has been suggested a strike price of around£95 per megawatt hour that was linked to inflation would yield accumulated revenues to EDF of £143.5bn over the 35 years of the contract, compared with £85.75bn if the contract were not linked to inflation. These calculations are based on an assumption that there will be an eight-year planning and construction period before the 35-year price guarantee kicks in, and annual consumer price inflation of 2% over the period. Inflation stood at 2.7% in May, according to official figures, and has averaged over 2.8% in 2012 Davey is confident that a site for the waste can be located democratically. He said: \"In terms of the location of the decommissioning, we need to be clear we already have huge amounts of waste left over now from the first two generations of nuclear reactors and from the military programme. We have to deal with that whether we build one single new nuclear reactor or not. It has to be dealt with. The waste from new nuclear will take up less volume – that would mean a slightly larger geological waste disposal facility than was needed anyway. Do I think we can achieve that? Yes, I do.\" He sounds positive despite a vote by Cumbria county council earlier this year to reject underground storage. He points out the West Cumbrian council including Copeland, which houses the Sellafield nuclear site, wanted to give the scheme the go-ahead. He said: \"We do want this to be a voluntary democratic process and not to force it on anybody, but we do think the vote of the two borough councils strongly in favour suggests that this approach will work. It is a lot of jobs, community benefit and a lot of economic activity. Other countries are doing this – the US, Finland, France, Canada, Sweden. In fact they are ahead of us in identifying and building these facilities.\" He is likely to recast the franchise so a go-ahead is needed only from the councils directly affected. Britain is seeking to spur new reactors as part of a £110bn investment plan to replace ageing power plants and upgrade grids. Davey said he was seeking to create the world's first low-carbon electricity market in the early 2020s, saying no one knew what the mixture would be: clean coal, different forms of renewable or new nuclear. The least-cost pathway to our 2050 climate change target would be a mix of the energies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/23/nuclear-leaks-bill-paid-taxpayer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-23T00:04:32Z","webTitle":"Nuclear leaks bill will be paid by taxpayer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/23/nuclear-leaks-bill-paid-taxpayer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/23/nuclear-leaks-bill-paid-taxpayer","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear leaks bill will be paid by taxpayer","bodyText":"The private consortium that will manage the decommissioning of Britain's ageing Magnox nuclear reactors will not be held financially liable if they suffer a major radioactive incident – even if it costs billions of pounds to clear up, it has emerged. The government will indemnify the private contractors, which means the taxpayer will be left to foot the bill for any leak, a similar arrangement to how things stand now. Critics complain that granting the multimillion-pound contract to a private consortium while freeing it of liability for a nuclear incident is such a poor deal for the taxpayer that it will render its new management unaccountable. The government has rejected this claim. Confirmation of the indemnity was made at the start of this month, when the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) slipped out a departmental minute relating to the Magnox reactors. Built in the 1960s, originally to produce plutonium to make nuclear weapons, the reactors include those at Sizewell, Hinkley and Dungeness. They are now at the end of their lives and the government is preparing to fully decommission them, something that has never been done with such a reactor anywhere in the world. The minute reveals that private companies would refuse to bid for the decommissioning contract if they had to face paying out billions of pounds over a radioactive incident. The minute explains that the firms \"are not prepared to accept liability\" and states that \"because of the nature of nuclear activities, the maximum figure for the potential liability is impossible to accurately quantify\". The minute, which was published before the parliamentary break, giving MPs only a week to debate its implications, says that there is only a \"low probability\" of a claim against the public purse. Labour MP Paul Flynn, who is deeply critical of the use of the indemnity, attacked the way it had been presented to parliament for using \"chicanery, subterfuge and secrecy\". He accused the government of denying parliament a detailed debate on the costs of nuclear, which has become a major political issue given the coalition's enthusiasm for building a new generation of reactors designed to help the UK secure its own energy supplies. \"There have been major nuclear accidents about every decade since Three Mile Island,\" Flynn said. \"More are very likely from technical failure, terrorism, human error or natural disaster. If risk is minimal, nuclear sites could be insured commercially.\" The energy minister, Michael Fallon, insisted that there was \"a very strong case\" for the indemnity, which he said was \"a prerequisite to awarding the contract and securing the benefits of the competition\". However, Flynn accused the government of taking a huge gamble. \"The cost of the Fukushima cleanup and damages ranges from $250bn [£150bn] to $500bn and rising,\" he said. \"Nuclear installations are uninsurable in normal commercial terms. Only gullible governments can bear the enormous risk. If operators paid for their own insurance indemnities, their case for economic production of nuclear electricity collapses.\" Opinion is divided as to why the government is so keen on pressing for a private consortium to manage the decommissioning process. One argument is that it will allow the government to bring in world-class expertise in nuclear decommissioning. But similar arguments were made when Sellafield, Europe's largest nuclear site, was put under private management and this had mixed results, with senior executives pocketing multimillion-pound bonuses at a time when there have been concerns about missed performance targets. Dr David Lowry, an independent environmental policy and research consultant, said coalition ministers were copying the example of their Labour predecessors. \"DECC tried to pull the same scam six years ago when it deviously avoided proper parliamentary scrutiny to permit mainly foreign contractors to earn multibillion-pound profits from the management contract for Sellafield, but left the cost of covering liabilities to the taxpayer,\" he said. A DECC spokeswoman said: \"We have a responsibility to clean up the UK's existing civil nuclear legacy in a safe and cost-effective manner. The taxpayer will not pay any money towards decommissioning of new nuclear, as this will be funded by nuclear operators.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2015/sep/25/we-can-only-save-nature-by-using-it-responding-to-ecomodernism","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-25T10:07:55Z","webTitle":"We can only save nature by using it – Responding to Ecomodernism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/sep/25/we-can-only-save-nature-by-using-it-responding-to-ecomodernism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2015/sep/25/we-can-only-save-nature-by-using-it-responding-to-ecomodernism","fields":{"headline":"We can only save nature by using it – Responding to Ecomodernism","bodyText":"It is refreshing and very welcome to hear the positive messages of the ecomodernist agenda, stimulating ideas and actions across different disciplines and across traditionally distinct groups. Also, it is good to see the emphasis placed on the potential contribution from technology to addressing environmental problems, though I am surprised that this is perceived to be so radical. Hasn’t technology and innovation always underpinned development and allowed people to reduce their direct dependence on natural resources? Following comments by George Monbiot and others, my remarks are partly about the framing of the agenda, and partly to consider the limits to technological solutions. On the framing of conservation, the ecomodernists present a polarised view of nature versus non-nature. They distinguish areas of the world that are given over to agriculture, or otherwise dominated by people, from areas of the world that still contain ‘nature’. Their pie chart shows just over half the world as nature, where nature is symbolised entirely by large, rare mammals, such as the great apes and the great whales. This framing sets people outside nature, and presents nature almost as a caricature, represented by some of the world’s most endangered species. But nature is everywhere, and people are part of nature. People have evolved alongside nature and nature provides us for free with all the things that underpin a healthy and fulfilling life – clean air, clean water, crops, a regulated climate, flood risk management, inspirational landscapes, beautiful species and many more. We cannot expect to continue to benefit from nature by putting it behind barriers and living apart from it. Neither can we expect to replace all these benefits that nature provides us with using technology. A recent review concluded that as you move back into the environment, starting with the goods that people use directly (energy, food, clean water), to the regulating services (climate regulation, flood control) and then to the underpinning ecological and evolutionary processes (nutrient cycling, primary production, decomposition), it becomes progressively harder for technology to augment them and progressively more often impossible to replace them. It would surely be reckless to intentionally separate people from the nature on which they depend, dismissing the close interdependence of people and nature that has supported us throughout human history. Turning to the potential for technological solutions. Yes definitely, of course this is the place to look for new ways of doing things better – technologies to improve people’s lives and livelihoods, limit detrimental impacts on the environment, and reduce global inequalities at the same time. But it is rare for any new technology to be simply and straightforwardly a good thing. In almost all cases, there are unintended consequences or side-effects, and there are winners and losers, often dramatically distinguished. Sometimes these present stark choices and often, even though we recognise the issue, society does not seem to have developed the institutions and tools to address them. Nuclear power is an efficient and highly productive energy technology. But it has risks, recently roughly every 30 years there has been a major problem with a nuclear facility, and it presents a problem for future generations as they will have to continue to deal with the waste we generate. GM crops are without doubt a very significant technology for increasing the amount and reliability of food production. But here the benefits are extremely unevenly distributed; a very small number of large corporations are the primary beneficiaries and most of the people who should be benefitting have limited options to improve their own circumstances. The development of artificial nitrogen transformed agricultural production in the mid 20th century underpinning the first green revolution that fed a rapidly growing world population. But the side effects in the environment have been and continue to be serious and hard to manage, with disruptions to global nutrient cycles and hard-to-reverse changes to downstream rivers and lakes causing pollution and loss of fisheries. It is important to appreciate that people’s lives are underpinned by nature, that not all of it (maybe only some very specific parts) are replaceable, and to beware of the idea that nature is dispensable, and that we can successfully live apart from it. Rather than the ecomodernist slogan ‘Save nature by not using it’, I would advocate ‘Save nature by using it, carefully and sustainably’ Georgina Mace is Professor of Biodiversity and Ecosystems at University College London and Director of the UCL Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/sep/26/oecd-heinrich-boll-international-energy-association-greenhouse-emissions-global-gdp","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-26T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Cutting greenhouse gas emissions won't slow global economic growth — report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/26/oecd-heinrich-boll-international-energy-association-greenhouse-emissions-global-gdp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/26/oecd-heinrich-boll-international-energy-association-greenhouse-emissions-global-gdp","fields":{"headline":"Cutting greenhouse gas emissions won't slow global economic growth — report","bodyText":"As the world works out how to avoid catastrophic climate change, one of the biggest questions remaining is whether we can continue to grow economically without also increasing greenhouse gas emissions. New research released this week at Climate Week NYC offers more hope that the answer might be yes. Prepared for green thinktank Heinrich Böll by DIW Econ, a German institute for economic research, the study found that, as a whole, countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have already decoupled their economic growth from emissions. From 2004 to 2014, OECD countries grew their economies by 16% all together, while cutting fossil fuel consumption by 6% and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6.4%, according to the report. The findings echo the results of an International Energy Association study earlier this year, which found that global emissions remained flat in 2014 while global GDP rose, marking a historical milestone. Four major factors have contributed to this decoupling, according to the Heinrich Böll study: increased use of low-carbon energy sources instead of fossil energy sources; increased efficiency in energy generation; increased energy efficiency on the consumer side; and a move away from energy-intensive manufacturing towards less energy-intensive service sector work. The biggest driver has been the reduced cost of renewable energy, particularly solar power, says Bastian Hermisson, executive director of the Heinrich Böll Foundation’s North America office. “Renewables are the only source of energy that is continually getting cheaper,” Hermisson says. “In many parts of the world, solar and wind power have become cost competitive with coal. Renewables are, increasingly, offering the best return for your money, in terms of new investments.” In Germany, for example, which has been a world leader in renewable energy policy, renewable energy costs have dropped 74% since 2006. Since 2004, Germany’s GDP has grown by 13% and its emissions have dropped by 11%. Conventional energy usage, including nuclear power, has dropped by 15% over the same period, while renewable energy usage has grown by 185%, and now represents 12% of the country’s total energy consumption. In the US, GDP grew 17% between 2004 and 2007, while energy consumption dropped 2%; conventional energy usage dropped 4% and emissions related to fossil fuel combustion dropped 7.4%. But the question of whether the world can continue to decouple economic growth and emissions depends largely on developing countries, which have taken on an increasing share of manufacturing. For the most part, developing countries’ economies are more dependent on fossil fuels, and they are growing to make up an increasing proportion of the total world economy. Here, again, the Heinrich Böll study offers a glimmer of hope: it found that China, a major manufacturing economy, has also used renewables to begin decoupling its economy and emissions. The report stated that a stronger decoupling “seems possible in the near future”. In 2004, China accounted for 9% of world GDP and 13% of energy consumption. Ten years later, those numbers had risen to 16% of GDP and 23% of energy consumption. This growth was, to a great extent, fueled by coal: in the same 10 years, China’s coal consumption grew by 74%. But in the last two years, a major shift has occurred, according to the report: China has increased its use of renewables by 27%, and its use of natural gas by 22%, while its coal usage has remained flat. In other words, China’s rapid industrial growth, which previously depended mainly on fossil fuels, now appears to be taking a more renewable path. This contrasts starkly with the energy picture in India, which is developing rapidly with a focus on coal. Since 2004, India’s coal consumption has more than doubled to account for over 57% of the country’s energy generation, according to the study. This has steeply raised emissions and has more than canceled out the benefits of its renewable energy growth. Hermisson emphasizes the importance of helping developing countries to move toward more sustainable models. “If we do not find a way to combine sustainability with the developmental ambitions of billions of people in the world, the future looks bleak,” he says. The secret may lie in exporting energy efficiency, along with manufacturing. “The goal is to make sure that, when heavy manufacturing moves to developing countries, the old way of doing things doesn’t follow it,” Hermisson says. “We don’t want to repeat the developmental model of the OECD countries.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/live/2017/feb/17/markets-edgy-uk-retail-sales-ftse-greece-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T16:50:49Z","webTitle":"Unilever shares hit record high after rejecting Kraft Heinz's £114bn takeover approach - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/17/markets-edgy-uk-retail-sales-ftse-greece-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/feb/17/markets-edgy-uk-retail-sales-ftse-greece-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Unilever shares hit record high after rejecting Kraft Heinz's £114bn takeover approach - as it happened","bodyText":"Hang on.... Moody’s have just warned that it might take a dimmer view of Unilever’s credit worthiness, if this deal happens. Ernesto Bisagno, Senior Analyst at Moody’s, explains: “Whilst it is still early days, Kraft Heinz’s offer for Unilever’s shares would be credit negative for Unilever’s bondholders, as 2017 pro-forma combined leverage would likely rise significantly - excluding cost savings and synergies - from the moderate 2.0x Unilever currently shows on a standalone basis. Also, Kraft Heinz’s current rating is Baa3 and thus five notches lower than Unilever’s A1 rating.” The London stock market has closed the week..and Unilever shares have ended the day up 13.5% higher at £37.97. That’s a new alltime closing high, and not far from the £40 per share which Kraft Heinz has proposed paying, in an offer that has electrified the City of London. Over on Wall Street, shares in Kraft Heinz have also jumped - they’re up 7% right now. That actually pushes up the value of the cash-and-share deal. But with Unilever standing firm tonight, its US suitor faces paying an even bigger price to get one of of the world’s biggest ever mergers off the ground. Chris Beauchamp of IG believes this story has much further to run.... For now the approach has been rebuffed, and in relatively robust language from the tone of Unilever’s response. Until today Unilever shares had steadily underperformed the FTSE 100 over the past six months, left behind by more glamorous sectors such as mining, but today has seen that situation reverse. Backed by Warren Buffett, Kraft is likely to return for another tilt at the prize, with a bid of this size unlikely to have been made without careful consideration. Here’s our latest news story on the potential deal: Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend. GW While Unilever’s shares have soared, the company’s bonds have taken a slip. Investors are worrying that it might take on a lot more debt if the Kraft Heinz deal goes though, potentially weakening its credit-worthiness. Hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal’s James Mackintosh: John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, believes the unions are right to worry about job cuts. He says: The main benefits from such a deal would be major cost reduction as head offices and regional management could be merged. There would also be some purchasing benefits from increased buying power. Changing attitude to food has put pressure on Kraft Heinz to pursue a merger, argues Mark Jones, a solicitor and food and drink industry expert at Gordons law firm. And that’s partly because younger people are keener on freshly cooked foods than previous generations, he argues. “Consumer choices are changing, we are moving away from processed foods and towards fresh. Millennials will soon surpass the baby boomer generation as the largest living generation and millennials are not keen on processed food. “The packaged food businesses have seen their sales growth slow in the last few years and because of this they are looking at ways to preserve margins. One way to do this is merge and take the benefit of economies of scale. The deal would make a lot of sense”. Others spreads, drinks and sauces are available, of course... The Unite union, which represents Unilever workers, is urging the company to reject Kraft Heinz’s ‘predatory’ takeover bid. It fears that a takeover would lead to job cuts, and a drop in quality, as the US firm tries to squeeze costs out. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy says: “Unite is seeking an urgent meeting with Unilever senior management where we will seek assurances that the company will resist this predatory takeover by Kraft Heinz. “Unite members make household products which are much loved by UK consumers. Kraft Heinz and their backers’ reputation for cost cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never ending drive to push costs down. “This takeover bid, is we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck. “Unite does not believe this takeover is either in Kraft Heinz workers’ interests or those of Unilever and that ultimately it will lead to jobs losses and poorer products for consumers.” Antitrust regulators might have issues with such massive companies merging, says ETX Capital’s Neil Wilson. Would competition authorities let this one through? It could come up against a number of hurdles as it would create a giant in the sector. EU regulators in particular could be against it. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has warned that jobs could be lost, and consumers could also suffer, if the deal goes through. He says: We anticipate that this has a lot to do with Brexit as well. Theresa May has not triggered the Brexit yet, the effects of this have started to surface. Perhaps, predators see a lot of blood and opportunity and falling sterling has produced enough blood on the street for firms around the world to look and cash on opportunities. They are coming out with big bazookas and trying to make deals which we have not seen. You can not blame them because tt is cheap for them and the time is right. So we do not think Kraft Heinz is going to back down anytime soon. If the deal does see the daylight, this simply mean more job loss for UK and more pain for consumers as competition will erode. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Kraft Heinz will need to raise its offer substantially, to get enough Unilever shareholders onside. ‘This is cheap money meeting industrial logic. Putting portfolios of brands together can create huge synergies across marketing, manufacturing and distribution, even before you think about cutting the combined HQ back to size. Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the Fast Forward button, for to acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades. With debt cheap and abundant right now, Kraft have spotted their opportunity. Unilever were clearly in no mood to sell, having spurned the first advance, but Kraft Heinz are not put off. But what will Unilever’s shareholders have to say? The long term boost to portfolios that Unilever has delivered has been enormous. A short term premium today is no compensation for losing the growth that Unilever could produce for decades to come. So to win over a majority of Unilever’s shareholders, we think Kraft Heinz will need to dig very deep indeed.’ This chart shows how Unilever shares surged to fresh record highs, driving its value towards the $143bn on offer from Kraft Heinz. Dutch TV journalist Durk Veenstra suspects that Unilever would accept a higher offer: Bloomberg’s Dan Wilchins says the fall in sterling since last summer has made UK-listed companies vulnerable to offers. Corporate band and reputation adviser Spencer Fox suggests the two firms aren’t a good fit: (Unilever CEO Paul Polman is a vocal advocate for corporate responsibility and running a sustainable business). So, we now know that Kraft Heinz has offered to pay around $50 per Unilever share. That’s around £40, at the current exchange rate. Unilever’s shares are now trading around £37.65 per share, up from £33.60 this morning. Newsflash: Unilever has just issued a statement to the City, confirming that it rejected Kraft Heinz’s approach. The Anglo-Dutch firm reveals that Kraft Heinz offered to pay $143bn (or nearly £115bn), in a mixture of cash and its own shares. But Unilever insists this isn’t enough, and says it doesn’t see any point in talking further. Here’s the full statement: Unilever notes the recent announcement by The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) that it has made a potential offer for all of the shares of Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. Their proposal represents a premium of 18% to Unilever’s share price as at the close of business on 16 February 2017. This fundamentally undervalues Unilever. Unilever rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever’s shareholders. Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions. Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. recommend that shareholders take no action. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. The proposal received was that Unilever common shareholders would receive $50.00 per share in a mix of $30.23 per share in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 new enlarged entity shares per existing Unilever share, which valued Unilever at a total equity value of approximately $143 billion. As at the close of business on 16 February 2017, a mix of $30.23 in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 Kraft Heinz shares per existing Unilever share would value each Unilever common share at $49.61, representing a premium of 18% to Unilever’s share price. Warren Buffett, one of the world’s richest men, is right at the heart of this merger bid. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group engineered Heinz’s takeover of Kraft in 2015, working with Brazil’s private equity giant 3G Capital. He’s now the largest shareholder of the company. Kraft Heinz has been cutting costs and boosting cash flows since it was created, which looks to be preparation for another merger. Shares in Kraft Heinz have jumped by over 3% in pre-market trading in New York. Between them, Unilever and Kraft Heinz control many of the world’s most popular consumer brands. Unilever produces washing powder (Persil and Surf), spreads (Flora and Bertolli), ice cream (Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Magnum and Cornetto), personal care items (Dove, Sure, and Vaseline), and cleaning products (Domestos and Cif). Kraft Heinz also has its fingerprints all over your kitchen, from ketchup, soup and Philadelphia cheese to Kool-Aid and Capri Sun. If this deal goes through, it would be one of the largest takeover deals ever. Unilever’s market capitalisation has surged to over £100bn since the FT broke the news that Heinz Kraft has made an approach. No foreign company has ever paid that much for a British firm. The biggest takeover ever took place in 2000, when mobile network giant Vodafone swept on German rival Mannesmann in a deal worth £112bn, or $180bn, at the time. Shares in Unilever have surged by 11% after Kraft Heinz confirmed that it has approached the company about a merger. They’ve jumped from £33.60 to over £37 per share, as traders bet that a deal will be done - despite Unilever’s initial rejection. Big breaking news..... Kraft Heinz, the food giant, has approached Anglo-Dutch consumer chain Unilever over a merger. Kraft has just issued a statement to the City, revealing that it approached Unilever with a proposal to merge the two companies. That approach has been turned down...but Kraft hasn’t given up. It says it hopes to reach an agreement with Unilever’s management. Here’s the full statement: The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft”) notes the recent speculation regarding a possible combination of Kraft and Unilever plc / Unilever NA (“Unilever”). Kraft confirms that it has made a comprehensive proposal to Unilever about combining the two groups to create a leading consumer goods company with a mission of long-term growth and sustainable living. While Unilever has declined the proposal, we look forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. There can be no certainty that any further formal proposal will be made to the Board of Unilever or that an offer will be made at all or as to the terms of any transaction. That speculation was sparked by the Financial Times’s Alphaville site, which reported this morning that an approach had been made. More to follow! City traders are betting that the retail sales slowdown has cut the chances of UK interest rates rising anytime soon. The pound fell as low as $1.2388, down almost a cent. Money is pouring into UK government bonds too, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on 10-year gilts to a three month low. That means the bonds are changing hands at the highest price since November -- another sign that rates are likely to stay low. There’s an argument that the fall in UK consumer spending over the last few months could be a good thing, in the long run at least. After all, economists have long worried that Britain’s economy was too reliant on its nation of shoppers. Perhaps a rebalancing is now taking place... Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, argues that UK households are sensibly adjusting to the Brexit vote. “It might not be what businesses want to hear but I’m pleased we’ve started to reign in our spending a little after our big splurge at the end of the year. We can’t keep on spending like there’s no tomorrow as it’ll cause massive problems later on. Households are going to feel the pinch as prices start to rise and we all need to be a little more sensible with our money. Sorting out a decent budget and being measured with your spending is the best thing to do right now. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial firm Sun Global Investments, also sees some positives: Sluggish wage growth and rising inflation would mean we no longer may be able to depend on consumers keeping the economy buoyant. However this could also be a good thing in the long term. Former Chancellor George Osborne always emphasised that the economy had to rebalance away from borrowing, consumption and imports to saving, manufacturing and exports. This rebalancing requires greater saving and less consumption and therefore the consumers have to retrench. This will be negative for the economy in the short-term but could mean a more balanced UK economy in the longer run.” Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, also fears that Britain’s consumers spending is faltering, following the drop in retail sales over the last three months. January’s report represents the first fall in three month on three month sales since December 2013, and suggests the underlying trend is indeed taking a turn for the worse. The prospect of a sustained dip in consumer spending is a sobering one for sterling, which has been supported by strong macro data during the political uncertainty of the last few months.” Today’s retail sales figures provide clear evidence that consumer spending will be squeezed this year, says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. A sharp turnaround in the inflation environment has put a sharp brake on the growth of retail spending - and we are likely to see more of the same as we move through 2017 and next year. Sentance also points out that consumers are no longer benefitting from cheap fuel -- prices for petrol have jumped in recent months, leaving less money for other goods. “In 2015 and the first half of last year, falling prices on the high street and at the petrol pump boosted the volume of retail spending. Shop and motor fuel prices were falling by 2.5% to 3% a year over this period and this supported 4.5%-5% growth in the volume of retail sales. “By contrast, this January we have seen a rise in prices in the retail sector - which are now nearly 2% up on a year ago. Not surprisingly this change in the inflationary trend has squeezed the growth in the volume of retail spending to just 1.5% compared with last year. Today’s figures show that the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote is now hitting the retail sector, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. All the numbers today show a downward trend and the anticipated knock to consumer spending from rising inflation may already be evident. Households are clearly starting to feel the effects of the pound’s fall in value and this will only get worse as prices rise over the coming months as hedging contracts expire. The CBI’s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, is also worried by the fall in UK retail sales -- it could show that consumers are cutting back. The slowdown in retail spending over the last quarter shows that consumers are tightening their belts, argues Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Reuters’ Jamie McGeever flags up that December’s retail sales were the third-worst in the last two decades: Samuel Tombs of Pantheon predicts that retail sales will keep falling this year, as retailers hike prices. This chart shows the big picture in UK retail - prices are going up, and the amount of stuff we can buy is going down. The pound has fallen sharply after today’s retail sales missed forecasts, shedding over half a cent to $1.242 Breaking: UK retail sales have fallen for the third month running, fuelling concerns that consumers are cutting back as inflation rises. The volume of goods sold online and on the high street shrank by 0.3% in January. That follows a downwardly-revised 2.1% plunge in December. That’s a big shock for the City - most economists expected retail sales to bounce back last month. The Office for National Statistics also found that retail sales fell by 0.4% over the last quarter, compared to the previous three months - the first fall since December 2013. ONS statistician Kate Davies says: In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013. The evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown.” The report also shows that inflationary pressures are buffeting shoppers -- average store prices (including fuel) increased by 1.9% on the year, driven by more expensive petrol. Details and reaction to follow! All the major European markets have dipped this morning, as the aftermath of Donald Trump’s press conference ripples through trading floors. Trump’s ding-dong battle with the press corps yesterday was big on jaw-dropping quotes (uranium is ‘nuclear weapons and other things’, for example), but didn’t contain much to reassure investors. Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First explains: President Trump’s press conference yesterday was a return to the policies and performance aesthetics of his candidacy. Accusations and grandstanding apart, the performance offered us little substance on any economic matters more than he has already told us. If candidate Trump returns to the podium continually while a Congress works to enact tax reform then the relationship between the two are all important. He needs Congress to build stuff but he does not need them to start tearing things down. Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, was also unimpressed, saying (via Reuters): “Trump’s erratic performance in the press conference has had a destabilising influence on investor confidence.” It’s been another bad day for Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, as the crisis at its nuclear division rumbles on. Shares in Toshiba slumped by another 10% today, after S&amp;P warned that it could sharply downgrade its credit rating if it restructures its debts. Such a move would be seen as a “selective default”, the agency said. Earlier this week, Toshiba revealed a $6.3bn writedown on the spiralling cost of two nuclear power station projects in America, following mass cost overruns and delays. A quiet start to trading in London has seen the FTSE 100 dip by just 7 points, to 7270. Traders have noted that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell last night, although the Dow did hit a record high for the sixth day running. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are sensibly banking some profits, as Donald Trump may struggle to deliver on his tax reform pledges. US equities closed lower last night after their massive rally and the stocks over in Asia traded mostly in the lower territory as well. Investors are confident about the economic health of the biggest economy in the world, the US, and are optimistic that upcoming fiscal and tax plans are going to have a more positive impact on the economy. Having said that, many do believe that the market is getting ahead of itself and there is just too much optimism about how far Mr Trump can go with his fiscal and tax plans as he still needs full approval from congress. The chances of that are not that great and this is what makes some investors a little pessimistic. Mr Trump applauded himself in a tweet yesterday by mentioning that the run in the stock market was mainly due to investor confidence which comes on the back of his upcoming tax plan. Of course, the question is how long can you chew on this, and if your words are not backed up with action, you run a massive risk of disappointment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Has the rally fizzled out? After hitting record highs on Thursday, the world’s stock markets are looking edgier today. Investors are digesting Donald Trump’s remarkable press conference, in which he blasted the press and defended his administration’s early progress - but didn’t flesh out his promises of tax reforms and fiscal spending. That has pushed some Asian indices into the red, with Japan’s Nikkei closing down 0.6% and China and Hong Kong also losing ground. It’s left us looking at a very quiet start to trading in London. But that could change at 9.30am GMT, when the latest UK retail sales figures are released. Economists are expecting to see that retail spending recovered in January, up around 1% in the month (including petrol), after falling unexpectedly by 1.9% in December. A weaker reading might indicate that consumers are now feeling the pinch from higher inflation, which has forced real wage growth down to a two-year low. RBC Capital Markets believe rising prices will cause a slowdown in the aisles. If consumers are having to pay increased prices, volume growth will be harder to come by than when there was deflation in the sector. Volume growth has already slipped from over 7% y/y in October to 4.3% y/y in December, with the consensus estimate for January data today looking for a dip below 4% y/y. Also coming up today... The Greek government and its creditors will continue talks over its bailout today. However, there’s no real hope of a breakthrough in time for next Monday’s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. This uncertainty could weaken the euro, warns analyst Tony Cross of TopTradr: We’ve been here many times before and a compromise will more than likely be found, but tensions are going to be heightened in Germany with the elections looming and continued distributions to other parts of the Eurozone continuing to annoy the electorate – even if they have by all accounts done very well out of the imbalance in recent years. EU officials are now suggesting that a deal could come in March... ....the omens from the football field aren’t encouraging for Greece’s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, though. Otherwise, it could be a quiet end to a lively week...."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-were-warned-about-risk-of-1bn-emission-fines","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-24T15:52:21Z","webTitle":"Car manufacturers were warned about risk of $1bn emission fines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-were-warned-about-risk-of-1bn-emission-fines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-were-warned-about-risk-of-1bn-emission-fines","fields":{"headline":"Car manufacturers were warned about risk of $1bn emission fines","bodyText":"In February, the environmental non-profit CDP published a report for investors looking at the auto manufacturing sector and the potential impact of increasing legislation and the shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles. We highlighted that several companies (including Volkswagen) could be at risk from fines for failing to meet stringent emissions targets for their vehicle fleets. We estimated some of these fines at potentially a billion dollars or more and, while investors accepted the findings of the research, there was some scepticism as to whether anyone would ever get fined that sort of money by the authorities. All that has changed this week with the announcement of the US EPA’s discovery that VW was dishonestly underestimating emissions from its vehicles. Emissions legislation is getting tighter around the world and many companies are struggling to keep up with current regulations, let alone more stringent requirements that may be introduced in future, particularly in China. VW’s response is a clear sign that some companies are not taking this seriously enough and have been trying to find shortcuts. It is also a sad consequence of the lobbying from EU auto manufacturers to promote diesel over hybrids and electric vehicles, which has left many lagging behind the Japanese (and the Americans in some cases) in what is now even more certain to become the primary emerging technology over the next decade. Companies ignoring climate and emissions risks These legislative drivers are by no means restricted to the auto sector, nor to emissions regulations. While everyone will be familiar with the catastrophic losses incurred by BP (and its shareholders) following the Macondo explosion, fewer people will be aware that in April 2013 the mining company Barrick Gold announced it was suspending construction on its Pascua-Lama mine over concerns about local groundwater pollution. In October that year, it announced it was shelving the project after investing $5bn. Three years earlier, the US utility Exelon responded to tighter EPA water regulations by closing one of its nuclear power plants 10 years early, in the face of an additional $800m of compliance costs. These are clear examples of how companies are constantly surprised by regulatory responses to environmental issues. Yet sectors and businesses continue to bury their heads in the sand, particularly when it comes to fossil fuels and stranded assets. Most companies respond that it won’t happen – governments will not stop supporting fossil fuels, demand will remain constant, and there will be no global agreement on a meaningful carbon price. The signs suggest otherwise. An agreement of sorts is almost certain to be signed in Paris at COP21, the OECD is calling for the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, demand assumptions are being challenged (the VW debacle will put pressure on the EU to shift away from diesel towards hybrids, which would reduce demand for oil), and over 60% of the world’s economies have a carbon price or are considering implementing one. This doesn’t take into account the implicit carbon prices in various regulatory frameworks around the world, nor the possibility of China restricting the use of non-electric vehicles in its cities in order to tackle pollution, which could have a profound impact on the future of auto manufacturing and the consequent demand for oil. Investors demand transparency So what is the appropriate response from companies? Investors are asking, through CDP, for companies to be transparent about their strategies to deal with climate change, water and deforestation and the consequent technological and legislative responses. They identify risks and opportunities and assess how their growth strategies might be impacted positively or negatively. Investors value disclosure and the opportunity to have meaningful conversations with companies about measuring, managing and mitigating risk. Many companies, however, are still focused on quarterly earnings expectations or too nervous that admitting risks will damage short-term share prices. To be fair, this is reinforced by a minority of investors who are also focused on the short term, but there is an inexorable trend towards longer-term thinking to create sustainable value. Acknowledging the problem, as we know, is the first step towards addressing it. Companies, for example those in the technology sphere, which can identify potential problems and solutions and are constantly anticipating changes in consumer demand and helping to drive technological progress, will undoubtedly be the success stories of the coming decades. Those who lag behind may well become the next Kodak."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/17/tim-peake-space-mission-political-vanity-pointless","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Tim Peake’s space mission is sheer political vanity | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/17/tim-peake-space-mission-political-vanity-pointless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/17/tim-peake-space-mission-political-vanity-pointless","fields":{"headline":"Tim Peake’s space mission is sheer political vanity","bodyText":"The ravening hordes pounced. The media, starved of that near-extinct species, a great British news story, went berserk. They were told the first real Briton was going into space (ie, not just a woman called Helen Sharman). He was a hero, a Major Tim. Eat your heart out, America. Back in your box, Russia. The BBC is close to tears. Somewhere in a back room Clare Balding is screaming, “It’s a gold, it’s a gold, it’s a win for Britain!” I have always wanted to go into space. Despite the trouble peeing, I would love to see the old place from 250 miles up. I even thought of signing up for the Virgin space shuttle, until I read it was about as safe as jumping off Clifton Bridge with a dodgy bungee. It never occurred to me that the government might pay for my ticket, let alone rank me with Mo Farah, Luke Skywalker and Sir Isaac Newton. In the Commons an elated minister, Sajid Javid, said that because of Peake he was ready “to boldly go to infinity and beyond” in spending on astronauts. Britain’s space industry would expand to £40bn by 2030 – money no object. Javid did not mention that this was the identical sum proposed by Gordon Brown’s government in 2009 when the UK Space Agency was set up. Nor did he explain why the space industry, which is always declared to be a great British success story, needed Peake personally aloft, when he was a pilot rather than a scientist or engineer. The big money in space today is in robots and satellites, not disposing of weightless urine. It is of course churlish at a time of great national rejoicing to suggest this story was so thin it would make a North Korean spin doctor blush. Peake is the eighth Briton in space, depending on how you allocate passports, and the first only on the 373rd flight to the international space station (ISS). It is hardly a big deal. Besides, he is only there courtesy of the European Space Agency. The children obediently cheering him on should have been waving European flags, not union jacks. It was like celebrating the first Briton to get to the South Pole entirely on expenses. A good history question might be to ask on what did Richard Nixon and Tony Blair agree? The answer is scepticism about humans in space. Nixon abandoned the American Apollo moon programme after just three years in 1972. Nasa kept an orbiting space shuttle going until 2011, but with each launch costing $1bn (£670m), its budget and its purpose dwindled. Blair declined to blow money on its successor, the ISS. To him, space was about money, not chauvinist glory. It was a good policy. David Cameron, who is a soft touch for any vanity project, donated a measly £16m to the ISS, but it was enough for Peake to be on his way. By then the argument had become almost entirely political. Nasa had shrivelled from 5% to less than 1% of the American federal budget, with most serious astronomers wanting it to concentrate on robotic exploration deep into space. The manned space lobby turned in desperation to Mars. Almost all the reported research on ISS is directed at “future space travel” by humans. Getting people – as against cheaper and more efficient robots – to Mars is political vanity at its most pointless and probably suicidal. But it remains the focus of space politics, for reasons all too evident this week. David Edgerton, a historian of science at King’s College London, has catalogued the waste into which past prestige projects have led governments and corporations. They include such supposedly life-changing products as Concorde, nuclear power, personal helicopters, high-speed trains, drip-dry shirts and atom bombs that would end wars. Futurologists once claimed that by today, ships, petrol engines, live entertainment and wet shaving would be obsolete. As for Soviet Russia, the country that did most to marry 20th century science – and space travel – to prosperity, the less said the better. Space lobbyists have mostly given up pretending they can change the world. They ignore rational argument and wander off into unquantifiables such as the competitive urge, the exploration gene and a great view. We get occasional mentions of “spin-off” inventions, such as memory foam, freeze-dried food and cures for arthritis. The moon programme once claimed the invention of Teflon, until it was pointed out that non-stick pans were on sale in 1945. One can only guess what really useful things might have been invented for the price of putting humans on the moon. The British government was this week reduced to its old fallback, a Briton in space was like the Olympics, delivering “legacy”. Peake in space would “reach out and inspire young people” to study maths and physics, and not the dreaded humanities. It is hard to believe six months of Peake will succeed in this, where a decade of Brian Cox on television has apparently failed. The science lobby is getting like the counter-reformation church, relying on blind faith and propaganda to ward off Protestants. The media’s belief that vanity projects must be worthwhile – because ministers would not back them otherwise – shows the power lobbyists now hold over government. Nothing seems able to stop George Osborne spending without control on the nuclear research laboratory Cern, the Hinkley Point power station, Trident or the HS2 rail link, even when common sense and his own officials know they are crazy. Of course we love to see that great blast of flame as human beings, in the words of John Gillespie Magee Jr, appear to “slip the surly bonds of Earth” and tread the “high untrespassed sanctity of space”. There is no denying the sense of awe. But I feel for other sciences labouring in less spectacular vineyards, such as neurology, immunology and cell chemistry, not to mention geriatrics and mental health. They cannot play the jingo card. They get no tweets from Downing Street or flag-draped school “weep-ins”. I know nothing is fair. The great god Proportion rarely stalks Whitehall these days. Display is all. But at least if a minister dares to say some public service “can no longer be afforded”, we can screech an abusive answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2016/jun/05/george-osborne-england-planning-arts-science-housing-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-05T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"The hard-hat chancellor: what kind of Britain is George Osborne building?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/05/george-osborne-england-planning-arts-science-housing-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/05/george-osborne-england-planning-arts-science-housing-transport","fields":{"headline":"The hard-hat chancellor: what kind of Britain is George Osborne building?","bodyText":"If George Osborne has an identifying attribute – what a cigar was to Churchill or a pint of beer to Zac Goldsmith – it is the pairing of hard hat and hi-vis jacket. One suspects he would struggle to wield a screwdriver to much effect but he loves to have himself photographed, again and again, on construction sites and industrial premises, dressed like a man who knows how to make things. The message is clear enough. Here is someone to get Britain building. Britain has an economy where construction has a particular status and where a favoured way to nudge the economy forward is to get more concrete mixers whirring and bricks laid. “Industry” can be almost synonymous with “construction industry”, due to the shrinkage of other types. The country also needs more homes. What then could be more appropriate than for the chancellor to remind people of his role in stimulating such things? He has a corresponding interest in putting his stamp on policies and projects that involve building, even when they are the concern of other ministries than the Treasury. He likes to promote housebuilders and then demonstrate that his plans are working. He declares a garden city in Ebbsfleet, Kent. He backs nuclear power stations and high-speed rail and promises to get them paid for with Chinese investment. Most surprisingly, from time to time he loosens the belt of the budgetary disciplinarian to reveal a closet minstrel, a profligate lover of the arts and of follies: development funding for a £278m concert hall that promises the outstanding acoustics currently lacking in large London venues, £30m to a garden bridge, lavish support to a large but vague arts complex in Manchester. He throws money at institutions of futuristic science. This Conservative politician begins to look like the French socialist builder of grands projets François Mitterrand or the English socialist Tony Benn, backer of Concorde. He has something too of the Dome-building Blair. He promises to leave a legacy of brick, concrete, steel and glass matched by few of his predecessors, which would alter the landscape of Britain, both city and countryside, to palpable effect. It is therefore reasonable to ask what is the sum of the parts, what future country is being constructed, what vision or at least assumptions underlie it all. There is certainly ambition to achieve benefits to which no one could object. If every initiative does what it is supposed to do, it would give the country better and greener transport, a secure supply of energy, an enhanced cultural life and prosperity based on advanced scientific research. The economy would be better balanced between north and south. More people would own their homes, some of them in well-planned new communities. In the case of the cultural projects, Osborne’s support arises from genuine interest. “He does like the arts,” says a formal special adviser to Osborne, Rohan Silva. “He’s a rare non-philistine in government.\" At the same time, there can be a phantasmagoric quality to Osborne’s monuments. With some, there can be reasonable doubt whether they will happen at all or exist more to enable the media announcement of the chancellor’s good intention. Others may not be the best way to achieve their stated aims but also serve as symbols of public benefits, devices for achieving maximum publicity and political advantage. As well as calculation there might also be an element of vanity, a recurrence of the not-uncommon weakness of politicians to glorify themselves with building, to build buildings that look as if they are addressing a need rather than addressing the need itself. The Great Wall of China, for example, impressive as it is to look at, was not all that good at keeping out Mongol hordes. Some of Osborne’s constructional largesse is inspired by graphene, the miraculous substance discovered by two Russian-émigré physicists at the University of Manchester, for which they won the Nobel prize. It is called the world’s first 2D material, being carbon one atom thick. It is transparent, extraordinarily light, flexible and 200 times as strong as steel. For now, many of its possible uses are in the nice-to-have rather than essential category – clothes embedded with electronics, flaccid mobile phones, low-energy and low-cost light bulbs – but it also has potential medical and other applications. It could conceivably be what steam power was to the Industrial Revolution and silicon was to the information age. For these reasons, and for the hopes it offered for an advanced industrial renaissance in the city most associated with a previous age of manufacturing supremacy, Osborne backed a £61m National Graphene Institute in Manchester and opened it last year. It would “put the UK in pole position to lead the world in graphene technology,” he said. The building looks crystalline and futuristic in an old-fashioned sort of way. It boasts dust-free PVC blackboards, a wildflower garden on the roof terrace and the only lab in the world with clean rooms on two different floors that are connected by a lift. A still bigger graphene-inspired organisation is being backed by the chancellor, the £235m Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials Research, which will have a “hub” in Manchester and “spokes” in Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and other cities. The idea is that it will “encompass 14 key areas of materials research including graphene”. The Royce and the NGI, said the chancellor, will “help cement the north, and Manchester in particular, as a world leader in science and innovation.” Not all scientists were convinced that graphene merited such a splurge of investment. A “very senior British professor” told the BBC that it is a “waste of money”, that it “will never be revolutionary: the technology is too limited – it is interesting but not a game-changer”. There was also a report in the Sunday Times, albeit one firmly slapped down by the university, of a revolt among researchers. It was said they refused to work in the building on the basis that their intellectual property was going to end up in the hands of foreign companies that had been invited into the institute as partners. Sir Andre Geim, one of the two Nobel-winning heroes of the graphene revolution, was quoted as saying that the new building was “money put in the British building industry rather than science”. Geim responded by calling the allegations “ridiculous” and “twisted” and said that his remarks had been taken out of context. “I see the relationship between the university and collaborating companies,” he said, “as a way to stimulate graphene developments for the good of UK plc.” In his telling, the institute is an admirable plan to do what business will not do unaided, which is to take a long-term view on investing in “disruptive technologies”. Osborne’s backing for Mancunian science is matched by his support for the city’s arts. Factory, a “world-beating arts space” designed by the celebrated architects OMA, is receiving £78m of its £110m capital cost from the Treasury, plus £9m in revenue funding from 2018 to 2020. This is a largesse for which most arts organisations would give both arms and all their dentistry. Factory is described as “large scale”, “ultra flexible” and as combining the qualities of the London Coliseum and Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. “This won’t only be unlike any other arts facility in the UK,” said Manchester city council leader, Sir Richard Leese, at a launch, “Factory will be unlike anywhere else in the world.” It will provide a single large hall, capable of performances to audiences of up to 5,000, but also capable of being subdivided for major exhibitions and smaller events. Maria Balshaw, director of the Whitworth Art Gallery and strategic lead for culture at Manchester city council, says it will be an “immersive”, “multi art-form” space that could house “a new kind of Ring Cycle”, “large-scale gallery-type shows” such as the Victoria and Albert’s David Bowie and Alexander McQueen exhibitions, and “challenging things like Massive Attack”. Ultimately, she says, the aim is “to get things to happen in the north that couldn’t happen anywhere else”. It will expand on the success of the Manchester International festival, which currently takes place in multiple venues but will make Factory its base. Factory could indeed be extraordinary but there are reasons to be sceptical. Great arts buildings are usually good at being one thing or another, an opera house or an art gallery, not both. For a project that was supposed to start construction this year and to which so much money has already been promised, Factory is light on specifics of artistic direction and, on published evidence, on audience research and business planning. Balshaw insists the work is being done, however “We’ve been going with our gut instinct,” she says, “but now we’re getting the business plan to prove it.” The senior BBC executive Jenny Baxter has just been announced as Factory’s project director. At worst, Factory risks being a rerun of the box-ticking, all-things-to-all-people, let’s-spend-the-money-somehow flops of the early years of lottery funding, a Millennium Dome of the north or the Public in West Bromwich writ larger. This suspicion might be enhanced by the fact that the idea arose in part from conversations between Osborne and Manchester’s chief executive, Sir Howard Bernstein, and a decision to go with what Balshaw calls “a very headline idea”. But Peter Saville, until recently creative director of the city of Manchester, believes that “the success and momentum of the festival does warrant a home”. He believes Factory could be the sort of talent-attracting institution that could help “make Manchester the most important city in the UK, because London is not in the UK anymore”. The venue’s name is a homage to Factory Records, the celebrated label of Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays and other bands whose works may or may not have reverberated round Osborne’s undergraduate rooms at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the 1980s brought rejuvenating cultural energy to a city battered by industrial decline. Factory Records was an entrepreneurial and improvisational outfit, driven by content over form or brand. Factory will be more top-down, driven by politics and publicity as well as culture. Saville, who helped create Factory Records and gave it its visual identity, is uneasy with the use of the old name for the new project. “This the festival’s building,” he says, adding that “the civic mindset doesn’t fully appreciate what Factory Records did.” As with other Osborne projects, the property business is not far away. It is meant to be part of “a new neighbourhood for enterprise, culture and living, called St John’s Quarter, worth an estimated £1.35bn when complete, proposed by the developers Allied London on the site of the former Granada TV studios. There will be a “small tight-knit urban grain, familiar to the old street pattern”, which will nonetheless be capable of accommodating towers rising up to 60 storeys. Factory, or even the mere promise of it, is plainly a boost to the marketing of St John’s. Something similar can be expected with the London concert hall. It is promised for a site in the City currently occupied by the Museum of London and, as the project develops, no one should be surprised to see a large commercial development, perhaps with a tower, riding on the back of it. Osborne’s tributes to art and science are, of course, part of his idea of a northern powerhouse, whereby the band of cities across Lancashire and Yorkshire are to become a nexus of commerce and culture to rival or complement London. As in the Randstad in the Netherlands or the Rhine-Ruhr region in Germany, a constellation of urban settlements is to become more than the sum of its parts, with the help of improved transport connections and restructured city governments. The principle is beyond reproach, promising as it does both to rebalance England in favour of northern locations that still haven’t recovered from the loss of manufacturing and away from overheating London. The doubts arise in the substance. Ed Cox, of the thinktank IPPR North, has said that “it’s a concept, rather than any actual, physical thing at the moment”. Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service, says: “There is huge potential here but there is still something of a gap between rhetoric and reality. Rebalancing is going in the opposite direction: there is a continuing shift towards the south.” He cites the findings of the University of Sheffield’s Political Economy Research Institute that “chaos reigns” and the “agenda remains a rather hollow one”. Nick Johnson, formerly of the sparky property company Urban Splash, says the northern powerhouse “is a brand, not driven by content, a diversion tactic designed to placate the people and the politicians of the north”. It also suffers from an “obsession with big-ticket projects” requiring large-scale corporate development. “We have to engage at a more granular level. We could be getting on with it right now with projects that would make a real difference. It should be about encouragement of local enterprise and its effect on attractiveness of a place.” He gives as an example his own current work helping revive Altrincham, a town that was “in intensive care”, through transforming its market into a haven of craft and good food. In this context, the grand projects look like marketing tools, conspicuous gestures that something is being done, and that co-operative city leaders will be rewarded with works on their territory. They may not all need to happen, or not soon, in order to achieve their boosting effect. Some, such as HS2, will be far in the future. This could be a rare example of political long-sightedness, or a neat trick, or a bit of both. “It’s genius,” says Johnson. “You hit it into long grass. You make something sound good and, hey presto, you’ve achieved the political chimera of achieving nothing while looking good.” The new housing prompted by Osborne’s help-to-buy scheme is palpable. You can see it all over the country in places such as Milby Hall at the Farm, outside Nuneaton, in one of the best known of marginal constituencies. These are at the opposite end of the scale of architectural ambition from the world of OMA, being the standard product of housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey. They are gawky, could-be-anywhere brick boxes with minimal frills dictated by the (sometimes) tight margins of the business. At the same time, they have odd extravagances: they are obsessively detached rather than terraced, for example, which means two external gable walls have to be built on the sides of houses on either side of a narrow passageway. They can be awkwardly laid out, with a tendency to build homes fronting on to traffic roundabouts. Help to buy is the scheme whereby, as the official website says, government “helps hard-working people like you take steps to buy your own home” by lending up to 20% of its value on easy terms. Most beneficiaries are almost certainly happy with it and it achieved its aim of stimulating the housebuilding industry at a time when it was sluggish. Much of its purpose was to speed up developments that would have happened eventually in any case, which is why a help-to-buy-assisted house looks like any other. The scheme’s opponents have accused it of being “economically illiterate” and say it will ultimately push up prices, which would be self-defeating. Even those who see merit in its original introduction question the government’s decision to extend it to 2020. However, the direction of Treasury policy is to augment it with other plans, such as the starter homes initiative and the extension of right to buy to housing associations, which have the same objective of encouraging home ownership with short-lived boosts to affordability. These also attract doubts. “I don’t know anyone who thinks it’s a good idea,” says one in the business about starter homes, whereby public subsidy enables homes to be sold at 80% of market value. “Who says what market value is? The potential for cutting corners and gaming the system is enormous.” These schemes deliver the opportunities for politicians to be photographed in hard hats, laying bricks and with lucky residents but, despite their tangible reality, they also have an illusionary aspect. They conceal the realities that the country is not achieving anything like its house-building targets, for example, and that promoting home-ownership is coming at the cost of dealing with housing need more widely. “There will be no more subsidy for rented homes – all the money is going into supporting ownership,” says David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation. “Ownership is important but not the only issue.” The result is that “poor people are not being well served and there is a much enhanced potential for unrest and for homelessness”. It’s easier to see the winners, in other words, than the losers, at least for now. It’s easier to see the new homes for sale that are being built than the new homes for rent that are not. And by now it is becoming clear what are consistent characteristics of the apparently disparate portfolio of Osborne-backed construction projects. They contain kernels of usefulness, some more than others, and address or purport to address real issues. They combine inflated claims with a diversionary quality and electoral calculation. They involve big business. They sometimes overestimate the power of construction alone to create the future and make the modern British assumptions that “industry” is almost coterminous with “building industry” and “business” with “property business”. Some of them may never happen. They ignore what Nick Johnson calls “granularity” – the small-scale enterprise and initiatives that make places distinctive and prosperous. The architecture of Osborne’s Britain is hybrid: iconic monuments by iconic designers such as OMA and Thomas Heatherwick in centres of cities, the ruthless viaducts of high-speed railways running between them, scatterings of standard housing around them. The creative energy that goes into the icons is unmatched by much idea of improving the planning or design of everyday space in which people spend their lives. Perhaps the soul, if it can be called that, of Osborne’s Britain, will be found in Ebbsfleet, north Kent, where he has declared that a “garden city” will be built. It would be the first, he said, for over a century, a statement that flagrantly overlooks the many new towns built on garden city principles after the second world war. “Britain has to up its ambition,” said the chancellor grandiosely. “Britain has to up its game, Britain has to earn its way in the world.” The idea of a garden city, developed by and under the influence of Ebenezer Howard in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, includes the co-ordination of built and green spaces, the integration of transport, the combination of places to live and work and the development of new and better types of housing. To achieve these aims requires, as happened with the new towns, the leverage that comes from public or communal ownership of land. As it currently stands, Ebbsfleet has few of these qualities, being rather an ill-connected scattering of housing estates sluggishly developed over many years. The question is whether the chancellor’s support will enable its inner garden city to blossom. The site is blessed by proximity to the high-speed rail link, which gets to St Pancras station in central London in 19 minutes, to the Bluewater shopping centre and to a Thames frontage. Its disadvantages include a poor infrastructure of drainage, broadband and power supplies and an absence of planning, which means that, for all the speed of the rail link, it takes a half-hour walk along hostile roads from the station to the nearest house. It stands in the workings of extensive former chalk quarries that leave lakes and sheer sides that resemble inward-looking White Cliffs of Dover. These are both assets and problems – they create the potential for a unique landscape but they also require money to convert the terrain into land for building. The Treasury has promised £310m to Ebbsfleet, of which it expects to get 70% back at some point, with a view to creating “up to” 15,000 homes and a commercial district. A development corporation has been set up. In the combination of work and home it will therefore have something of a true garden city, and a masterplan is imminent, from the consultancy AECOM, which promises to bring sense and connection to its disjointed fragments. Sir Rod Aldridge, formerly of Capita, is hoping to back an academy school where 20-30% of the curriculum will be dedicated to training in entrepreneurship. It will not, promises the chairman of development corporation, Michael Cassidy, have that “empty Stepford Wives feel” of dormitory suburbs outside working hours. Where it will differ from real garden cities is that the land will not be publicly owned, which means that the development corporation can only nudge and chasten developers into raising their game. It means not creating models of new neighbourhoods to be followed around the country, but getting the housebuilders, Persimmon, contrary to its practice on some developments elsewhere, to provide a door into the garden as well as a front door. The site is further complicated by the decision of Osborne’s ex-cabinet colleague, the former communities secretary Eric Pickles, to assign part of it to a gigantic new London Paramount Entertainment Resort, an employment generator at such time as it opens, but before that a monster whose demands for road access make a cohesive town centre hard to realise. It doesn’t sound likely that Ebbsfleet will be much like a garden city that Ebenezer Howard would recognise or be proud of. As developers don’t like to build too much too quickly, the pace of growth is unlikely to be much above 1,000 a year, or about 0.4% of estimated national need. None of which is the fault or responsibility of Cassidy and his team, who will no doubt deliver good and useful things within the limitations set. “I’ve got to work in the realms of the possible,” he says. It’s just that this will not be the world-beating exemplar promised by Osborne. “I’m not sure he’s interested. It’s just a game,” says an informed observer, who speculates that Osborne’s main motive in backing Ebbsfleet was to “stymie” the ambitions of his coalition partners, the Lib Dems, to promote garden cities elsewhere. A country with better trains, a re-energised north, an acoustically perfect concert hall and other cultural marvels, with new homes provided in well-planned garden cities, with increased home ownership alongside better housing for everyone, with prosperity led by brilliant scientific innovation, perhaps even with nuclear power stations reducing dependency on fossil fuels, would be a wonderful place. It might even benefit from a garden bridge, if it were well designed, well sited and reasonably priced. Even the greatest Osborne-sceptic must concede that at least some of his initiatives will bring some benefits some of the time. It might also be accepted that to achieve change requires a bit of talking up and a bit of political cunning. But the ratio of rhetoric and opportunism to achievement in Osborne’s Britain is high. The more you look, the less there is to see."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/19/nuclear-power-station-consent-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-19T14:50:00Z","webTitle":"New nuclear power station gets planning consent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/19/nuclear-power-station-consent-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/19/nuclear-power-station-consent-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"New nuclear power station gets planning consent","bodyText":"Plans for the first new nuclear power station for nearly a generation in the UK have got the go-ahead from the energy secretary, who has said he is granting planning consent. Ed Davey told the House of Commons the French energy firm EDF would be allowed to build two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, on the site of an existing power station, which is due to close in 2023. \"It's vital to get investment in new infrastructure to get the economy moving,\" Davey said. \"[Hinkley] will generate vast amounts of clean energy and enhance our energy security. It will benefit the local economy, through direct employment, the supply chain and the use of local services.\" The two 1.6-gigawatt reactors will become one of the biggest power plants in the UK, providing enough electricity for up to 5m average homes. The nuclear plant is expected to be the first in a series of new ones the coalition has proposed as part of its plans to replace ageing coal and nuclear facilities that are due to be closed over the next few years. However, the symbolic decision on planning permission still leaves Davey's department for energy and climate change and EDF locked in negotiations over how much subsidy the company will get during the life of the plant. It is thought officials are discussing a contract that would guarantee the French company being paid nearly £100 for each megawatt hour of electricity produced over 30 to 40 years. Under the system, called \"contracts for difference\", if the market price, which is about half that level, is lower than the agreed minimum \"strike price\", electricity suppliers will have to pay the difference by making a surcharge on customer bills; if the market price rises higher, then the company would forfeit the difference. EDF and government officials also have to agree how much the company will pay for long-term storage of nuclear waste. \"Discussions on both those are on going and intense, but I expect them to be concluded shortly,\" Davey said. Critics say the subsidies will cost bill-payers at least £1bn a year, pointing out that a strike price of nearly £100 would be higher than all but the highest of the government's forecasts for future electricity prices up to 2030, and in opposition to a host of government policies designed to reduce that price. However, ministers believe the contracts for difference, available for all low-carbon power, will help develop a variety of energy sources including renewable energy as offshore wind, nuclear, new gas plants and, in future, carbon capture and storage equipment fitted to gas and coal plants. These sources would make the UK more resilient to fluctuating power prices, and reduce the carbon emissions on which climate change is blamed. Davey declined more than once to comment on the negotiations, but added: \"When the deal is concluded we will be completely transparent on that deal, whether it's on the strike price, the length [of the contract] or other details.\" There are additional concerns that when a deal is agreed with EDF, the European commission could launch an inquiry into the subsidies, which would qualify as state aid. That would delay the project by at least 18 months. EDF would then have to begin finding funding of up to £14bn to pay for construction of the turbines. Approval has been granted for the design of the EPR (European Pressurised Reactor) reactor, and the Environment Agency last week agreed to the environmental permits needed. Building the reactors is expected to create 20,000-25,000 construction jobs, and 900 permanent jobs when the plant opens. Katja Hall, the CBI chief policy director, said: \"This is a big step forward on a critical energy infrastructure scheme. Major projects like this not only help us to overcome our energy challenges, but provide a real boost to growth, creating thousands of jobs directly and through the supply chain. A balanced energy mix is essential in order to ensure secure, low-carbon and affordable supply in the future, and new nuclear is a key part of this.\" Keith Allott, chief adviser on climate change at WWF-UK, a wildlife protection group, said: \"Backing nuclear means shifting a huge liability to British taxpayers for the cost of building, electricity and, crucially, dealing with the waste. \"Unlike renewable energy, the costs of nuclear keep on rising, as witnessed by the fact that the only reactors currently being built in Europe are massively over-budget and far behind schedule. Focusing on renewables and energy efficiency, on the other hand, where the UK has huge potential to be an industrial leader, could deliver both huge cost reductions and a substantial boost to UK economic growth and manufacturing.\" The most recently built nuclear plant in Britain is Sizewell B, which was constructed in 1995."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2014/jul/17/grand-central-review-passion-tahar-rahim-lea-seydoux","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-17T20:40:00Z","webTitle":"Grand Central review – atomically charged Tahar Rahim-Léa Seydoux romance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/17/grand-central-review-passion-tahar-rahim-lea-seydoux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/17/grand-central-review-passion-tahar-rahim-lea-seydoux","fields":{"headline":"Grand Central review – atomically charged Tahar Rahim-Léa Seydoux romance","bodyText":"Rebecca Zlotowski has made a startling erotic drama set in and around a nuclear power station; its characters are irradiated with the sickness of obsessive love.

The study attempts to counter the argument that only fossil fuels and nuclear power can keep the lights on for the next few decades. It foresees wind leaping from today’s level of 13 gigawatts (GW) of wind farms in operation – enough to power around 10 million homes – to a level of 77GW in 2030, with solar rising from just more than 5GW to 28GW. However, the renewables drive would need to be accompanied by a 60% reduction in demand for domestic heating through a home insulation programme and other initiatives, according to the report by energy system analysts, Demand Energy Equality. “For a long time the government and the fossil fuel industry have peddled the argument that renewables can’t keep the lights on if the wind’s not blowing. This hasn’t been based on evidence, but out of date instincts seemingly from staring out the window to see how windy it is,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. “For the first time, we have the evidence showing it is possible to keep the power system working and decarbonise the electricity system. We need to go for renewable energy with the help of new smart technology and reducing demand for power too. “It is hugely ambitious but definitely doable, and it will take the same kind of enthusiasm and financial support from government, normally the sole preserve of the nuclear and fossil fuel industries.” The plan, which would require a major change in government policies, envisages fossil fuels playing a role via combined gas-fired heat and power projects. Many homes and buildings would also need to move away from gas-fired boilers to their own ground source heat pumps or an electricity source. The report is published in the run up to the UN-sponsored climate change talks in Paris and at a time when the Conservative government has axed a series of green subsidy schemes to wind and solar on the grounds of cost. The feasability of decarbonising the UK’s power generation system, which was dependent for a long time on carbon-heavy coal, has long been argued over. Few believe that carbon dioxide can be eliminated entirely from energy production, or at least in the short term. In 2014, around 30% of UK electricity was generated by coal-fired power plants, 30% by gas, 19% by nuclear and around the same amount by renewables, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The new analysis shows a low-carbon energy sector is possible but only if our relationship with energy changes at the national, household and personal level. There would have to be a huge increase in building efficiency and in the use of smart meters, so that demand could be dialled down when needed. The cost of the transformation programme is not spelled out, but the Greenpeace report notes that a similar study done in 2011 by Poyry consultants for the parliamentary climate change committee produced a price tag of between £126bn and £227bn to achieve 65% renewable penetration by 2030. Wind would play the greatest role in energy production in the new low carbon world envisaged by Greenpeace. The 55GW of offshore wind and 22GW of onshore wind would require a significant increase in investment. The wind lobby group RenewableUK said there was no reason why more wind farms should not be built. “There is no technical or logistical barrier to the UK installing up to 55GW by 2030, but it needs political will – a supportive policy framework from government, especially sufficient financial support allocated in the offshore wind pot,” said a spokesman. David Infield, a professor of electrical engineering at University of Strathclyde, who had read the Greenpeace report, said it was a serious document that deserved attention. “This is a useful report dealing with the complex issue of absorbing high penetrations of renewable power generation in line with achieving challenging reductions in carbon emissions,” he said. The big difference is that the energy department’s forecasts are based on what it believes is feasible under certain circumstances by 2050, rather than the 2030 time period used by Greenpeace. This makes a huge difference in mobilising capital and undertaking the work necessary. The Greenpeace study has ruled out nuclear because of the financial and environmental cost of building new plants, such as Hinkley Point C, and dealing with the legacy of their waste. Equally, carbon capture technology – where carbon dioxide is stored underground as soon as it is emitted – has been excluded as it is deemed an unproven method."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2015/may/14/harry-shearer-ned-flanders-mr-burns-set-to-leave-the-simpsons","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T08:34:44Z","webTitle":"Harry Shearer, voice of Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, set to leave The Simpsons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/14/harry-shearer-ned-flanders-mr-burns-set-to-leave-the-simpsons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/14/harry-shearer-ned-flanders-mr-burns-set-to-leave-the-simpsons","fields":{"headline":"Harry Shearer, voice of Ned Flanders and Mr Burns, set to leave The Simpsons","bodyText":"Harry Shearer, who voices a host of well-loved characters on The Simpsons, has indicated that he will leave the long-running animated show. He wrote a pair of tweets quoting Simpsons producer James L Brooks: Shearer’s departure is significant, as he is responsible for a number of major characters: endlessly chipper Christian neighbour Ned Flanders, Bart’s nemesis Principal Skinner, and venal nuclear power boss Mr Burns, along with his repressed assistant Smithers. He also voices smaller fan favourites like the Arnie-esque Rainier Wolfcastle and intergalactic antagonist Kang. Rumours on the gossip site TMZ recently suggested one actor was not signed up to the newly announced 27th and 28th seasons, thanks to disputes over profit sharing and merchandising, though Shearer wasn’t named. Producer Al Jean said in a statement that Shearer was “offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed.” Jean added on Twitter that it was “confusing” that Shearer implied he left to do other projects, “which we always let him do”; Shearer asserted on Twitter that his decision “wasn’t about money”. Jean meanwhile told the New York Times: “We do not plan to kill off characters like Burns and Flanders but will recast with the finest voiceover talent available.” Despite Brooks’s assertion that “the show will go on”, Shearer’s departure would leave the show in dire straits, with many perceiving it to have run on too long already. The show’s US ratings are much lower than in its pomp in the 1990s, with some episodes of season 26 dipping below 3m viewers for the first time ever – but it is still relatively successful, and a powerhouse in terms of branding and merchandising. Unlike many of the rest of the voice cast, Shearer has enjoyed a varied career outside the Simpsons. He co-wrote and starred in enduring rock mockumentary Spinal Tap prior to joining the show, and has since appeared in similar comedies like A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration; last year saw him play Richard Nixon in Nixon’s The One, in which he acted out White House recordings of the former president.

While saying he would not interfere in other countries’ politics, Gore said he was “puzzled” by the Conservative government’s measures to roll back support for renewable energy. Citing a range of recent government actions - such as slashing subsidies for solar and wind power, and ending support for energy efficiency in homes - he said he could not understand the rationale for such measures, while climate change presents a clear danger to the UK and the rest of the world. “Will our children ask, why didn’t you act? Or [will they] ask, how did you find the moral courage to rise up and change?” he demanded of a business audience at a climate change debate in London on Tuesday. “The UK’s historic legacy of leadership on the most important moral issues faced by humanity, including the climate crisis, is long and has been recognised with respect by the community of nations,” he said. “It is time for the UK government to honour and live up to that legacy, and return to its global leadership position, domestically and abroad, by supporting an ambitious international agreement in Paris that unleashes the power of the private sector to create a global clean energy economy.” Fossil fuels have enjoyed subsidies at least 44 times as high as those for renewable energy, Gore said, in a pointed reference to David Cameron’s government’s decisions to effectively end the building of new onshore wind farms, and slashing of support for solar panels. The UK government has also vowed to increase support for oil and gas, from the North Sea and through fracking. Gore also slammed the idea that developing countries, such as China and India, are not interested in a deal on global warming. “What do [Chinese people] desire? Clean air, clean water, clean land to grow food,” he said. His words echoed forceful criticism from the most senior voice in UK business, CBI director-general John Cridland, who warned that ministers were discouraging investment in the UK’s green economy, and endangering billions in potential overseas sales of green goods and services. Ben Goldsmith, chairman of the Conservative Environment Network and a venture capital investor in clean technology, said it was “crap” for the government to say there was “no money” for renewable energy development. “I hope the government has a plan,” he said, “but I’m not sure they do.” He contrasted the lack of support for renewables with the £2bn loan granted to French and Chinese investors for the building of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley, which is also guaranteed – when it starts generating power – to be allowed to sell its energy to UK billpayers for double the current electricity price. Andrew Bonfield, financial director of National Grid, also called for more strategic thinking from government, saying that his company had to think five decades ahead about its plans, and would like government to send clear signals for long-term policy development. He predicted that within two years, solar power could be as cost-efficient as fossil fuels. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was notable that the UK’s business leaders were critical of the government’s recent actions on climate change. He said: “From Britain’s business leaders to the government’s own advisers [the climate change committee’s letter to government], the chorus of opposition against George Osborne’s ideological assault on clean energy just keeps growing. His increasingly erratic and capricious policies are not only harming UK businesses and ripping off consumers but are also isolating Britain ahead of a crucial climate summit. “When Al Gore ironically remarks that Osborne is not the prime minister, he makes a very good point. David Cameron should take heed of it and start wresting back control of energy and climate policy from the chancellor’s hands.” Matthew Spencer, of the Green Alliance, which convened the conference, called on ministers to show leadership on commitments to combat climate change, ahead of the Paris meeting. In response to Cridland, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We are pushing for a strong global deal in Paris that creates a level playing field for business and drives innovation. Our priorities are to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way and also keeping bills as low as possible for hardworking families and businesses. Government support has already driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly, helping technologies to stand on their own two feet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-robots-taking-over-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-30T17:30:00Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock: 'Instead of robots taking over the world, what if we join with them?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-robots-taking-over-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-robots-taking-over-world","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock: 'Instead of robots taking over the world, what if we join with them?'","bodyText":"James Lovelock lives with his wife, Sandy, in an old coastguard's cottage less than 100 metres from Chesil beach in Dorset. To reach it, you have to drive along a rough, mile-long road, which in stretches has collapsed because of the winter storms that pounded the shingle spit. You must have had a devastating winter, I say when I eventually find the cottage. Not devastating, he insists, despite having been cut off by floods for four days, fascinating. Which sums up Jim Lovelock perfectly. The inventor/scientist/environmentalist is captivated by and curious about everything, which is why at 94 he radiates joie de vivre. He is the youngest 94-year-old you could ever hope to meet. His new book, A Rough Ride to the Future, is part memoir of his long life in science and part prediction of whether humankind can survive. I had intended to ask him whether it was a final testament, but the question dies in my throat. He so obviously doesn't plan his life that way. He has mastered the art of getting old by not giving it a moment's thought. The concept for which Lovelock is best known is Gaia – the idea that the Earth is a single, self-regulating entity in which the organic and inorganic interact to sustain life. He developed the idea in the 1960s when he was working for Nasa and has returned to it frequently; he says defending it from detractors is one reason he carries on writing. \"I want to keep fighting the battle because the academics just won't buy it, whereas most other people have.\" Lovelock, who for the past 50 years has been what he calls an \"independent scientist\" unfettered by institutional links, reckons he knows why academics reject Gaia. \"It's political,\" he says. \"You can't run a university unless it's divided into subjects. If you try and teach the whole lot, it becomes a complete mess and the vice-chancellor goes mad, so they have to divide it up. But if you divide it up, you can't understand it.\" Lovelock, who trained as a chemist but is just as interested in and likely to expound upon physics and biology, detests academic compartmentalisation. \"The universities,\" he says, \"have reached a point similar to the monasteries in the middle ages where the monks counted the number of angels that could stand on the head of a needle.\" The thesis underpinning A Rough Ride to the Future is what Lovelock calls \"accelerated evolution\". He argues that Thomas Newcomen's invention of the steam engine in the early 18th century was as significant in evolutionary terms as the emergence of the first photosynthesisers more than 3bn years ago, ushering in an age in which human activity has had a rapid and profound effect on the planet. \"The changes in the environment that we see as adverse – from rising carbon dioxide abundance, climate change and population growth – are,\" he writes, \"all consequences of this new [evolutionary] inflation; as may be economic instability and the tendency of the human species to become city or nest animals.\" He cites Moore's law, which states that a computer's processing power doubles every two years, and says we, too, will have to adapt to this speeded-up world. Man likes to assume he is the end of the evolutionary cycle, but dinosaurs, who held sway for almost 150m years, probably laboured under the same misconception. In the book, Lovelock posits the idea that one consequence of accelerated evolution could be that at some point we ourselves incorporate inorganic elements in our bodies. \"Instead of robots going to war with us and taking over the world, which is the way it's always portrayed in science fiction,\" he says, \"I thought, what happens if we join with them?\" I express a polite degree of incredulity, but he persists. \"It's already happening. I've got a pacemaker, which is a very handy device and works like a dream. I'm beginning to regard it almost as part of my body, and don't think about it. My pacemaker is an old-fashioned one. It has a battery that lasts 10 years and has to be replaced, but already pacemakers are starting to be thought about that use the body system to provide the energy to keep them going. It's coupled to the physiology of my body more or less completely, and, much more sinister, it has a radio communication with the outside world so that the technician can check it every year to see whether it's working. This really bothers me, because I can see it's only a short time before my body's on the internet and receiving spam. Once you go in for this endosymbiosis with the mechanical world, you're in for trouble, and we've started.\" Lovelock, who manages to be both playful and deadly serious at the same time, is almost converting me to the idea. \"Computers are getting more and more organic all the time,\" he says. \"They are being made from carbon, and I can envisage a process whereby an endosymbiotic person with these things in it will sufficiently fuse the two life systems together that it will become a single person that will breed true.\" I ask when this startling development might occur, but he prefers not to make a prediction. Cue further incredulity on my part. \"Dash it all,\" he says, \"we're pretty odd when you think that we started off 3bn years ago as single cells floating around.\" If academics dismiss the notion of Gaia, how are they going to react to Lovelock's projection of robo-people? Won't they just dismiss him as a crank? \"I'm sure some will,\" he admits, \"but that's why I've always been an independent scientist.\" If he was part of an academic institution, he says, he would never be able to explore the wilder shores of science. He left the Medical Research Council in the early 1960s, when he felt it was becoming more restrictive. \"I wanted to be free. I could see tramlines of security going on to retirement and the grave. It was very selfish and very stupid of me in many ways.\" Stupid because he was by no means wealthy, had four children, and soon after quitting his job his first wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But happily the US rescued him with offers of work at both Nasa and Hewlett-Packard, and his career as a freelance scientist-inventor was launched. Lovelock's pursuit of freedom had begun even earlier. The son of working-class parents who ran an art shop, he grew up in Brixton, south London, \"hated school like poison\", and taught himself science from books in the local library. He says he wanted to be a scientist from the age of four when his father gave him a primitive electronics set, and reckons the sense of science as a vocation that motivated him has largely disappeared. \"The whole system of teaching has lost it, because it's taught as if you were going into a career. It isn't a career and never should be. I've never had a career. One lives from day to day, and doesn't think about it too much. That's why at approaching 95 I don't think about ageing and death. I just think, 'What's the next job?'\" Lovelock had a heart attack 30 years ago and has had surgery on 40 occasions since, so to be in such good shape at 94 is miraculous. Ageing is inevitable, and doesn't worry him in the slightest. \"Everything's running down, so enjoy it while you can. It's not a gloomy thought at all. You wouldn't have energy to do things unless things were running down.\" He is thinking of planets as well as people. \"Earth is about as old as me if you look at it in comparative terms. It doesn't have long to go. It could be as little as 100m years, though I think it's more likely to be about 500m. As things age, they become much more vulnerable to disturbance. If someone as old as me gets pneumonia, it'll probably kill me, whereas if you're young you'll shrug it off. It's the same with planets. If there was an asteroid impact as big as the one 65m years ago, it would be quite dodgy. The older a planet gets, the less capable it is of resisting such an event. Life gets more complex and more vulnerable to disturbance.\" Shouldn't this news worry us? \"Of course it shouldn't worry us. If we [as a species] are still around in 100m years, it would be amazing.\" He doubts whether anything resembling man will still be around, but even that can't dent his essential optimism. \"I don't mind the thought that a hundred progeny from now I'll be unrecognisable,\" he says. There will, he reassures me, be a bit of us left in whatever emerges, just as the DNA of those first cells from 3bn years ago feature strongly in our own DNA. Lovelock's new book is likely to be claimed by both sides in the climate change debate. He has pulled back from the alarmist predictions of The Revenge of Gaia, published in 2006, and now says the rate of global warming is slower than he anticipated. \"I was a little too certain in that book,\" he admits. \"You just can't tell what's going to happen.\" He says the oceans store most of the heat from the sun, tempering the impact on the atmosphere, and our lack of understanding of the likely effects of the warming of the oceans makes it very difficult to predict the long-term impact. \"It could be terrible within a few years, though that's very unlikely, or it could be hundreds of years before the climate becomes unbearable.\" Won't this give succour to climate change deniers? \"It's just as silly to be a denier as it is to be a believer,\" he says. \"You can't be certain.\" He says climate change scientists should adopt the same level of statistical stringency as exists in medicine. So we need to take the politics out of climate science? \"Oh sure, but we're tribal animals. We can't help being political.\" I suggest to Lovelock, who dislikes the fetishisation of eco-causes, that he has a complicated relationship with the environmental movement. \"Not really,\" he insists. \"I'm an old-fashioned green, a person who's happy with that Selborne character, Gilbert White [the 18th-century parson, writer and pioneering naturalist]. I'm very old, and the British countryside up until world war two was glorious. It was heathland all the way from London to the coast, and you could walk everywhere. Humans and the countryside were in a wonderful equilibrium. We were just another animal in the place, but it got wrecked with the coming of cars.\" Lovelock sees environmentalism today as a form of what he calls \"urban politics\". \"It's become a religion,\" he says, \"and religions don't worry too much about facts.\" He is an enthusiast for nuclear power, which makes him unpopular with many greens. \"I'm a scientist and an inventor, and it is absurd to reject nuclear energy,\" he says. \"It all comes from the religious side. They feel guilty about dropping atom bombs on people. Here was this extraordinary gift given to humans – a safe, cheap source of power – and it gets horribly abused right at the start. We're still playing out the guilt feelings about it. But it's sad because we in Britain could now be having cheap energy if we'd gone on building [nuclear power stations].\" Nuclear waste? \"It isn't a problem,\" he insists. \"Sandy and I were invited to France, and we stood on 25 years of nuclear waste at La Hague. I had my own handheld monitor to check whether they were bullshitting me about it, and it was showing about the same reading as I was getting in this room. It was completely safe. The Swiss did a study of the number of deaths per year in all the various power systems, and nuclear beats everything.\" What about the meltdown at Fukushima in 2011? \"That's the most amazing collection of lies ever known,\" he says. \"There is virtually no wildlife damage anywhere near Fukushima. Levels [of radiation] are much too low. Nobody was killed, nobody was even hurt, so what was all the fuss about? It's all propaganda. People badmouth nuclear so nobody dares use it.\" He also supports fracking, but only as a second-best to nuclear power. \"The government is too frightened to use nuclear, renewables won't work because we don't have enough sun, and we can't go on burning coal because it produces so much CO2, so that leaves fracking. It produces only a fraction of the amount of CO2 that coal does, and will make Britain secure in energy for quite a few years. We don't have much choice.\" Lovelock is usually considered to be an opponent of wind power, but he says that's not quite true. He doesn't object in principle, but thinks wind turbines are an inefficient way to produce energy, and doesn't believe the results justify the despoilation of his beloved English countryside. Solar energy? Terrific, he says – in the desert. \"Europe could get all its energy from the Sahara, but politics screws it. A solar farm 100 miles by 100 miles could supply energy for the whole of Europe, but terrorists would blow it up.\" Turning all the lights in Europe off, he points out, would be an even bigger coup for al-Qaida than knocking down the Twin Towers. Lovelock manages to be both catastrophist and boundless optimist at the same time. He believes humanity will suffer crises that threaten the species, but will somehow pull through. \"We shouldn't worry too much about terrible disasters because they've happened in the past [when we may have been down to just a few thousand individuals] and we've come back. We are an extraordinarily special species, the first to harvest information.\" So we will survive – at least until evolution turns us into something else a few million years down the road? \"Oh sure,\" he says, the afternoon sun bathing his still surprisingly youthful face in light. \"As a species, we're cunning bastards.\" • An exhibition, Unlocking Lovelock: Scientist, Inventor, Maverick, opens at the Science Museum on 9 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/apr/21/hartlepool-nuclear-power-plant-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-21T08:34:54Z","webTitle":"Hartlepool nuclear power plant fire triggers emergency response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/21/hartlepool-nuclear-power-plant-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/apr/21/hartlepool-nuclear-power-plant-fire","fields":{"headline":"Hartlepool nuclear power plant fire triggers emergency response","bodyText":"A fire at a nuclear power plant triggered a major response by emergency services after smoke was seen billowing into the air.

Coal-fired power plants are closing down just about everywhere. They are being replaced by renewables and gas-fired plants, or rendered unnecessary by improved energy efficiency. Some jurisdictions, including Ontario in Canada and Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, are already coal-free. Others will follow, including whole nations like the UK, which is likely to close its last coal-fired station sometime in the 2020s. Even China, where new coal-fired power stations were opening on a weekly basis until recently, is reducing its use of coal. Many Chinese coal mines are closing, but the biggest effect has been to slash imports, down by around 30% so far this year. The reasons for this development are not hard to find. Rapid reductions in the burning of fossil fuels are necessary if we are to prevent catastrophic climate change. Calculations of the “carbon budget” consistent with holding global warming to 2C show that global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by around 2025 and decline thereafter. Of all the fossil fuels, coal is by far the worst. It is twice as carbon-intensive as gas, its main competitor in electricity generation. And, in addition to its effects on the global climate, coal is responsible for toxic emissions of mercury, sulphur dioxide and other pollutants, estimated to cause millions of deaths every year. The much-touted idea of “clean coal” has proved to be a fantasy. Carbon capture and storage, in which the exhaust gases from coal-fired power stations are captured and sequestered underground, is hopelessly uneconomic. One hugely expensive pilot project opened in Canada last year. Many others have been abandoned, such as Zerogen in Australia, White Rose in the UK and FutureGen in the US. Even research on the technology has largely dried up. Australian “clean coal” funding, once in the billions, has slowed to a trickle. Coal is, and always will be, dirty and dangerous. The implication is obvious: the phasing out of fossil fuels must begin with coal. The world needs to stop opening new coal mines, and close existing mines in line with declining global use of coal. This obvious message is not one that coal mining companies and the Australian government want to hear. Faced with the end of coal in the developed world, and even in China, they have switched to a new argument, notably propounded by Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg. Frydenberg and others argue that we have a moral obligation to supply coal to poorer countries like India, in order that they can take the cheapest possible path to meeting their needs for more energy. It is far from obvious that coal is in fact the cheapest source of energy for India. Large parts of the country have yet to be connected to the electricity grid, and might do better to move straight to renewables. And the health effects of burning coal, serious in developed countries, are far worse in India. Pollution from coal is estimated to kill more than 100,000 people in India each year. These health effects could be mitigated, and many lives saved, with modern pollution control technology but that would eliminate much of the cost advantage being touted by the “moralist” advocates of coal. The idea implicit in the moralist case for coal is that India should recapitulate the Industrial Revolution, based on heavy industry with all the associated pollution and poison. In reality, India has done far better by leaping straight to the modern Internet economy, developing employment in everything from call centres to software development. In the same way, a full accounting of the costs would show that India would do better to jump straight to modern renewables than to expand 20th century technologies like coal and nuclear power. But suppose for the sake of argument that, if the global cost of carbon dioxide emissions were disregarded, coal would be cheaper for India than the alternatives. It would still be more costly for the world as a whole. In these circumstances, the supposed moral argument for coal cannot be sustained. People concerned about our moral obligations to developing countries have advocated policies under which rich countries like Australia would bear the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions in poor countries like India, to the benefit of the world as a whole. There are many such measures on the table, and others that the Australian government could implement if it chose. A policy based on the strict demands of morality would require a global emissions trading scheme, with equal emissions rights per person. The sale of unused rights would compensate India for forgoing the high-emissions route to development. Such a scheme is, of course, anathema to the global political right, whose opposition has doomed any prospect of its emergence. But there are less demanding options that could be followed. Most obviously, the purchase of rights under the Clean Development Mechanism would allow Australia to meet more ambitious emissions reductions targets, at very low cost, while providing financial benefits to poor countries like India. The Australian government has, so far, ruled this out. Alternatively, more direct support could be provided for the development of renewable energy. The government has offered $200m to the Green Climate Fund, once derided by Tony Abbott as an international “Bob Brown fund”. A tax on coal exports could be used to fund a massively increased contribution to this and similar funds, allowing India to make the jump to clean renewable energy. Of course, ideas like this would not be welcomed by the coal industry. But those advocates of coal who are motivated by a moral concern for the poor should welcome the chance to demonstrate their sincerity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/jul/07/climate-change-denial-scepticism-cynicism-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-07T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"How climate scepticism turned into something more dangerous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/07/climate-change-denial-scepticism-cynicism-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jul/07/climate-change-denial-scepticism-cynicism-politics","fields":{"headline":"How climate scepticism turned into something more dangerous","bodyText":"Last month Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. For his supporters, it provided evidence, at last, that the president is a man of his word. He may not have kept many campaign promises, but he kept this one. For his numerous critics it is just another sign of how little Trump cares about evidence of any kind. His decision to junk the Paris accord confirms Trump as the poster politician for the “post-truth” age. But this is not just about Trump. The motley array of candidates who ran for the Republican presidential nomination was divided on many things, but not on climate change. None of them was willing to take the issue seriously. In a bitterly contentious election, it was a rare instance of unanimity. The consensus that climate is a non-subject was shared by all the candidates who appeared in the first major Republican debate in August 2015 – Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee and Trump. Republican voters were offered 10 shades of denialism. As Huckabee quipped in January 2015, any talk of global warming was a distraction from the real dangers the country faced: “A beheading is a far greater threat to an American than a sunburn.” Trump’s remarks on climate may have more been erratic (“I want to use hairspray!” he said at one point, confusing global warming with the hole in the ozone layer) but their consistent theme was that manmade climate change is a “hoax”, perpetrated by the enemies of the US, who may or may not include China. Climate science has become a red rag to the political right. The scientific consensus is clear: more than 95% of climate researchers agree that human activity is causing global warming, and that without action to combat it we are on a path to dangerous temperature rises from pre-industrial levels. But the mere existence of this consensus gets taken by its political opponents as a priori evidence of a stitch-up. Why else would scientists and left-leaning politicians be agreeing with each other all the time if they weren’t scratching each others’ backs? Knowledge is easily turned into “elite” knowledge, which is tantamount to privileged snobs telling ordinary people what to think. Trump’s stance reflects the mutual intolerance that now exists between those promoting the scientific consensus and those for whom the consensus is just another political racket. Trump didn’t create this division. He is simply exploiting it. It is tempting for anyone on the scientific side of the divide to want to apportion all the blame to the “alt-facts” crowd, who see elite conspiracies everywhere. But there is more going on here than dumb politics versus smart science. The facts are not just the innocent victims of politics. The facts have long been put in the service of politics, which is what fuels the suspicions of those who wish to deny them. The politicisation can cut both ways. The politics of climate change poses a stark dilemma for anyone wanting to push back against the purveyors of post-truth. Should they bide their time and trust that the facts will win out in the end? Or do they use the evidence as weapons in the political fight, in which case they risk confirming the suspicion that they have gone beyond the facts? It is not just climate scientists who find themselves in this bind. Economists making the case against Brexit found that the more they insisted on agreement inside the profession about the dangers, the more it was viewed with suspicion from the outside by people who regarded it as a political con. Post-truth politics also poses a problem for scepticism. A healthy democracy needs to leave plenty of room for doubt. There are lots of good reasons to be doubtful about what the reality of climate change will entail: though there is scientific agreement about the fact of global warming and its source in human activity, the ultimate risks are very uncertain and so are the long-term consequences. There is plenty of scope for disagreement about the most effective next steps. The existence of a very strong scientific consensus does not mean there should be a consensus about the correct political response. But the fact of the scientific consensus has produced an equal and opposite reaction that squeezes the room for reasonable doubt. The certainty among the scientists has engendered the most intolerant kind of scepticism among the doubters. Not all climate sceptics are part of the “alt-right”. But everyone in the alt-right is now a climate sceptic. That’s what makes the politics so toxic. It means that climate scepticism is being driven out by climate cynicism. A sceptic questions the evidence for a given claim and asks whether it is believable. A cynic questions the motives of the people who deploy the evidence, regardless of whether it is believable or not. Any attempt to defend the facts gets presented as evidence that the facts simply suit the interests of the people peddling them. Climate change is the defining political issue of our times and not simply because of the risks we run if we get it wrong. An inadequate response – if we do too little, too late – could inflict untold damage on the habitable environment. But even before that day comes, the contest over the truth about climate change is doing serious damage to our democracy. The fight over climate reveals how easily politics can get in the way of the facts, and how hard it can be to escape once cynicism exerts its grip. In many ways, climate science is particularly vulnerable to political distortion. But the issue of climate change also shows that it is a false comfort for liberal elites to think that the facts will win in the end. If they do, it won’t be because we woke up to the science. It will be because we woke up to the politics. * * * Climate science has not always been so political. The idea that manmade carbon emissions are contributing to significant changes in the climate first came to public notice in the 1960s and 1970s. But attention to the issue was not primarily driven by politics, despite an attempt by Richard Nixon when president to push for more research into the issue. Most of the early consciousness-raising came from journalists. In 1975, Newsweek made a splash with the claim that the science of climate change was pointing to the imminent threat of global cooling. This warning gained notoriety but little political traction, at a time when the dangers of nuclear war and the economic consequences of the oil crisis crowded out other forms of apocalypse. The political consequences had to wait decades to be felt. Many of the recent Republican presidential candidates cited over-the-top scare stories about global cooling from their childhood as a reason to discount scare stories about global warming today. What politicised the idea of climate change was its adoption as a cause by Democratic politicians in the 1980s, above all by Al Gore. By the start of that decade, evidence of global cooling had faded and a scientific consensus was starting to form around the idea that the climate was warming up. Gore belonged to a group known as the “Atari Democrats”, for their wonkish attachment to science and technology. These politicians saw climate as a useful issue, as well as an urgent one. It was a way of appealing to moderate Republican voters, because the concerns it raised cut across party lines. In the words of another member of the group, Chuck Schumer, then a Brooklyn congressman, now Senate minority leader: “If you’re a Democrat, especially in a middle-class district or on the west coast, [climate] is a great issue … It is an issue with no downside.” The ecumenical quality of climate change as a political cause was emphasised when Margaret Thatcher took it up at around the same time. In her speech to the UN general assembly in 1989, she spoke of global warming as one of the most serious threats facing humanity. She was comfortable speaking the language of science, having been a scientist herself. But her motives were political: it suited her prior point of view. She drew extensively from the warnings of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, in part because she had grown to trust their advice on climatic conditions during the Falklands war. She believed in nuclear power as an emblem of free enterprise. And she had historic reasons to be suspicious of coal. For Thatcher, climate change was a convenient truth. But no issue, once politicised, remains ecumenical for long. In 1989 Thatcher’s time was nearly up. Gore’s was just beginning. Through the 1990s and 2000s, as climate change became associated with left or liberal policy positions, it started to receive serious pushback from the right, for whom the political motivations of those championing the science were obvious. Climate change was seen as a vehicle for promoting big government and higher taxes. It became a totem of the partisan divide. This was the beginning of a vicious circle of mutual distrust. Once science gets dragged into the territory of politics, its opponents can accuse it of being a distortion of science. Scientists are meant to be politically neutral, at least as far as their science is concerned. Yet it is almost impossible to remain neutral when you are under political assault. In these politically charged circumstances, there is no safe space for the facts to retreat to. That was made clear by the so-called “climategate” scandal of 2009, when a series of hacked emails from the University of East Anglia was held up as evidence that the scientific evidence was being distorted to fit a political agenda. The emails showed no such thing. What they did reveal is that in an environment of highly politicised scepticism, climate scientists were forced to think about guarding the evidence against opponents looking for any excuse to discredit it. In private correspondence, the UEA scientists talked about presentational “tricks” for describing the data and the need to favour certain outlets for publication over others. They looked out for their friends and they were wary of their enemies: that’s politics. There was nothing wrong with the science, as was confirmed by an extensive series of inquiries into the affair. But the emails betrayed the scientists’ awareness that the idea of a consensus on manmade climate change was under concerted attack. So they went out of their way to shore up the consensus. Which, when revealed, confirmed to their opponents that the consensus was a sham. This is how climate scepticism becomes climate cynicism: doubts about the evidence are replaced by doubts about the motives of the people using it. In 2012, Senator Jim Inhofe, a Republican who once brought a snowball on to the floor of the senate to show that climate change wasn’t real, published The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future. The book contains two lengthy appendices. The first is the full transcript of the UEA emails, presented as prima facie evidence that the science is a fix. The second is a history of the United Nations global development programme. The argument goes like this: there is no need for world government unless there are issues that can’t be solved by national governments. Climate change is such an issue. So it follows that it has been invented by people who can’t justify world government any other way. It is a globalist plot. Once cynicism becomes the default mode of attack, then both sides are trapped. Moreover, it is not a level playing field. It favours the cynics. Scientists have to decide whether to let the facts speak for themselves, or whether to try to take on the cynics at their own game. If they pull back from politics, they risk letting the cynics set the agenda. If they don’t, they risk proving the cynics right. * * * Cynicism is fuelled by the ease with which uncertainty about the science can be spread. All it takes is time and money. Questioning climate science suits the interests of the fossil fuel industry, where the politics of climate change has long been seen to pose a direct threat. Ever since climate became a political issue in the 1980s, the big oil companies have been funding an extensive PR operation to raise questions about the strength of the evidence. ExxonMobil alone has spent more than $240m on public relations in this area in the past two decades. Many of the leading Republican candidates for president in 2016 (though not Trump) took campaign funding from the Koch brothers, who have been at the forefront of the fight against the scientific consensus on climate change. The currency in which these campaigns trade is doubt. Their goal is to sow uncertainty in the public mind about what the science shows. In the words of an American Petroleum Institute action plan from 1998: “Victory will be achieved when average citizens ‘understand’ uncertainties in climate science.” To that end, money has been funnelled towards scientific researchers who dissent from mainstream opinion, even if those researchers are in a very small minority. Sowing doubt turns out to be relatively cost-efficient, because dissent only needs a few exceptions to the orthodoxy, whereas consensus requires everyone else to hold fast to it. However, it is no coincidence that this is how the oil industry chooses to see the struggle. Framing it as a contest between heterodoxy and orthodoxy fits the language of scepticism. In that way, it can be made to appear consistent with both science and democracy. Democracy needs dissent in order to function. Scientific progress depends on people being willing to challenge the conventional wisdom. Many climate sceptics argue that they are the ones on the side of science, because the currency of science is doubt. But when heterodox opinion gets purchased with hard cash, it cements the triumph of cynicism. Money ensures that motives are what matter. The ultimate goal of the merchants of doubt has been to politicise the orthodoxy, not simply to dispute it. What has given climate scepticism political teeth over the past two decades is the drive to associate the scientific consensus with the political establishment. Mainstream scientists and mainstream politicians are both viewed as belonging to a club that is comfortable spending other people’s money but deeply uncomfortable with anyone else’s point of view. In an age when all kinds of elites are viewed with suspicion, portraying scientists as a well-connected interest group leaves them vulnerable to political attack. Scientists take public funding. Scientists pass judgment on each other’s work. The scientific establishment is just another a closed shop. Political cynicism has weaponised climate scepticism. But it might also prove to be its achilles heel. Just as pure science struggles with the fact that it can’t avoid politics, so pure politics struggles with the fact that it can’t avoid science. Even the most cynical political operators need to know what’s really likely to happen. As reporting in the Los Angeles Times has shown, at the same time that it has been funding a PR campaign to question the scientific consensus, ExxonMobil has also been funding some of the research that underpins that consensus, including studies of rapidly shrinking ice levels in the Arctic. In the words of David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman, writing in the New York Review of Books, “a company as sophisticated and successful as Exxon would have needed to know the difference between its own propaganda and scientific reality”. Kaiser and Wasserman argue that, as a result, the company has committed fraud: it failed to disclose to its shareholders the basis on which it was making its investment decisions. Its business plans take it for granted that climate change is a real and imminent threat. This behaviour has clear echoes of an earlier attempt to challenge the scientific consensus: the campaign by the big tobacco companies to dispute the link between smoking and cancer. Although many of these businesses recognised as far back as the 1950s that the science was sound, they funded a body of widely disseminated research designed to throw doubt on that view. Their goal was to keep the public open-minded about the dangers of cigarettes, and therefore to keep as many of them puffing away for as long as possible. It was a purely cynical business strategy, and in some cases it was criminal as well. It worked to the extent that it bought the tobacco industry time to reorient its investment and marketing to take account of the new reality. But in the long run it failed. No reasonable person – and certainly no serious politician – now doubts the link between smoking and cancer. The fate of tobacco can give hope to people who worry that the truth is always outgunned: the science won out over the cynics in the end. Are there grounds for thinking that the same will be true for climate science? The tactics of the industries in question may be similar, but the cases are different in crucial respects. Tobacco impacts on its victims directly – smokers do eventually die – and it was when personal experience caught up with industry denial that the argument was lost. It is possible that climate change could kill even more people than smoking. But any damage on that scale is still a long way off. It is also far less direct. The victims will not necessarily be the people who are currently engaged in the most harmful behaviour. Once it had been established that smoking causes cancer, it was clear what had to be done to prevent it: individuals would have to stop smoking and tobacco companies would have to stop encouraging them. There is no equivalent certainty around climate change, even once we accept the scientific consensus that it is real. Those responsible for causing it are not those who will suffer most from it. The current migration crisis is partly being driven by changes in the climate affecting food and water supplies in Africa and the Middle East. But the politics of migration will never find answers in the science of climate change, for the simple reason that the science does not tell us what to do about it. Climate change has distinctive features as a political issue that make it much more intractable than other controversies in which the science was once in cynical dispute. The hyper-politicisation of climate science has coincided more or less directly with the rise of social media; the fight over tobacco took place before the age of the internet, which at least gave scientists some measure of protection from personal exposure. Meanwhile, the consequences of climate change are long-term, global and uncertain. That means any solution places a huge premium on trust. We have to trust that it really will cause harm. We have to trust that we are responsible for any harm it causes. We have to trust that any action we take won’t be undone by the inaction of others. In an age of enormous mistrust in politicians, this poses a huge challenge. We need far more trust in politics than we have at present in order to take concerted action on climate change: apart from anything, we would need to believe that politicians would be willing to share in the sacrifices they ask of us. In the meantime, those who are determined to sow suspicion about the merits of concerted action are fuelling our mistrust in politics. There is no equivalent of watching a relative die of lung cancer to split the difference. * * * The people who made the case that smoking causes cancer were not generally thought of as hypocrites. It’s true that some of them still smoked, even after they knew the dangers. But there were far more smokers inside the tobacco industry, where being seen with a cigarette in hand was positively encouraged as a signal that there was nothing to worry about. Climate science is different. Ever since it became a political issue, it has been bedevilled by accusations of hypocrisy. The internet is awash with tales of Al Gore and his monstrous double standards: he racks up enormous air-conditioning bills in his multiple homes; he leaves his private jet idling on the runway as he spreads the message that flying is wrong; he sells his television network for megabucks to al-Jazeera, where the money to buy it comes from Qatari oil. In the words of the National Review in 2016: “The [climate] hysterics are hypocrites. It’s austerity for thee but not for me as they jet around the world to speak to adoring audiences about the need for sacrifice.” Until wealthy liberal New Yorkers start selling up their Manhattan real estate and moving to higher ground, the cynics say, there’s really nothing to worry about. Recent research by a group of psychologists shows why this is such a problem: we dislike hypocrites because we hate they way they seem to be signalling their superior virtue. Take two kinds of claims about environmental activism. Under one set of conditions, a speaker claims to recycle his rubbish, after which it is revealed that he does no such thing. Under the other, a speaker tell his listeners they should recycle their rubbish, after which it is revealed that he does not do it himself. The first is a liar. The second is a hypocrite, but not a liar, since what he says is still true (people should recycle their rubbish). Most people respond with relative equanimity to the lie. But they loathe the hypocrisy, because the hypocrite seems to be patronising them. This is terrible news for environmentalism. Doctors who smoke are not really patronising their patients: if anything, they are revealing sympathetic human weakness. But environmental activists who leave the engine running are easily portrayed as dreadful elitists: they think the rules don’t apply to them. The populist rabble-rousers of the right have exploited this fact mercilessly. Hypocrisy is hard to avoid when it comes to the politics of climate change, since it is a collective-action problem. It’s far from clear what difference any individual action will make. What matters is what we do together. This makes it practically impossible for any one individual to match words to deeds. Yet the failure to do so provides the perfect stick for the climate cynics to beat their opponents with. If we dislike hypocrisy more than we dislike lying, then it is not just a problem for climate politics. It is a problem for democracy. It gives the liars their chance. During the presidential campaign, it was widely hoped that Trump’s relentless record of untruths would be his undoing. In the New York Times, David Leonhardt painstakingly listed the 26 lies Trump told in the first presidential debate, which ought to have been enough for anyone. But Trump has always been careful not to come across as the wrong sort of hypocrite: the kind who seems to be talking down to people. Hillary Clinton was not so careful. And when the voters get to choose between the two, the hypocrite loses to the liar. In the febrile, divisive state of our politics, it’s not what you say, it’s what you say about yourself by saying it that really counts. The social media revolution amplifies and exaggerates these kinds of accusations. It has become easier than ever to find evidence of how individuals’ public attitudes are given the lie by their private actions. There are now so many public attitudes to choose from, and private actions are now so much harder to hide. Twitter is a vast hypocrisy-generating machine that is corroding democratic politics. Scepticism, which is a democratic virtue, is giving way to cynicism, which is a democratic vice, across the board. * * * Since his arrival in the White House, Donald Trump has been in the middle of a tug of war between the liars and the hypocrites inside the West Wing. On one side stands Steve Bannon, representative of the “alt-right”, still looking to flush out the hypocrisy of the globalists and ready to peddle any old conspiracy theory to achieve his goals. On the other stand the younger members of Trump’s family, including his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who are more concerned with keeping up appearances. Climate change quickly emerged as one of the fault lines in this showdown. In the end it was Bannon who persuaded Trump to make good on his promise to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. Kushner argued that this would send the wrong signal and that much more could be achieved by sticking with the agreement but reorienting it to suit the interests of the big American fossil fuel producers. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who was previously the CEO of ExxonMobil, sided with Kushner. They lost. In this case, both approaches are equally cynical. For Bannon, everything, including climate science, is just an extension of politics: all that matters is which side you are on. For his opponents inside the administration, climate change can be sidelined as an issue by paying lip service to the consensus while acting in ways that make it irrelevant. The liar denies that climate change is really happening. The hypocrite accepts that it is real but behaves as if the words don’t mean anything. Trump’s administration is dragging climate science further into the swamp of partisan politics. Populist attacks on the scientific consensus co-opt reasonable doubt and turn it into unreasonable suspicion of another self-interested elite. The natural tendency of any elite under this sort of pressure it to build the castle walls higher in order to keep the interlopers out. Faced with a concerted assault on their integrity, what should climate scientists do? They face a choice. One option is to try to reclaim climate scepticism from the people who have corrupted it. The other is to insist more strongly than ever on the consensus. When the space for doubt has been taken away, you can respond by becoming more certain of your own position. Or you can try to take doubt back. There are lessons for the politics of climate change from economics. The economics profession, like any other, is full of people who will express their doubts and uncertainties among friends. But when confronted with a hostile or bemused public, they will close ranks. Economists do not want to appear to be unsure of themselves, given how little the public understands of what they do anyway. So rather than admit that there are many different ways of thinking about, for example, free trade, they insist that all economists agree it is a good thing. As the economist Dani Rodrik puts it, when faced with hostile fire, the natural tendency is to start circling the wagons. For the many voters who do not see the benefits of free trade, this looks like a stitch-up. Economists have found themselves vulnerable to the same dilemma as climate scientists. If they express doubt, the cynics rip them to shreds. But if they conceal doubt, the cynics rip them to shreds anyway. Political pressure often tempts experts into making predictions about the immediate future to prove their point, even though this is a hostage to fortune. Economics is not really meant to be a predictive science. But making predictions is a good way to get attention in a very noisy news environment. The temptation always exists to reduce long-term forecasts to short-term predictions in order to get a hearing. Some economists fell into this trap before Brexit. By talking up the immediate downside, they made it easy to dismiss their warnings when the worst failed to happen straight away. The costs of a failed prediction far outweigh the benefits of an accurate one, especially when that prediction has made in the service of politics. Political journalism is now suffering its own version of this failure. Reasonable doubts about Trump and Jeremy Corbyn were too often accompanied by journalistic predictions that they couldn’t possibly win. These predictions were made to show that scepticism about their politics was something more than just one commentator’s opinion: it was based on a testable hypothesis that would be borne out by events. When the predictions turned out to be wrong, the reasonable doubts got discredited, too. Climate scientists have not faced an embarrassment on an equivalent scale to the financial crash of 2008 or the elections of 2016-17: the big shock they didn’t see coming. Were global warming to turn back into global cooling, climate science might find itself in the same boat as the economics profession: derided for its failure to provide any kind of warning mechanism for the real dangers we run. For now, the main accusations it faces are of crying wolf. In their eagerness to push the idea that climate change is real, environmentalists have too often been drawn into making premature claims about when we will feel its effects. Gore did it in An Inconvenient Truth, released in 2006, when he talked about a 10-year tipping point after which disaster would be at hand. He also overstated the threat of larger and more frequent hurricanes, in the recent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Until the wolf is at the door, shouting louder and louder about how close he is does no good. It plays into the cynics’ hands. Science often makes for bad politics, because it pretends that it is not politics. The most effective political arguments for taking climate change seriously cannot therefore be ones that simply rest on the science. We need to stop thinking that one side has possession of the truth and the other is just running on money and prejudice. Both sides get tempted into being economical with the truth in the cause of politics. The cynics know what they are doing, which is what makes them cynics. The other side often doesn’t, which is what leads them into the cynics’ trap. We live in an age when mistrust of politics has spilled over into mistrust of expertise, and vice versa. To respond with ever-greater certainty in the name of science is a big mistake. Expertise doesn’t just need humility. It also needs to reclaim the idea of scepticism from the people who have abused it. Experts need to find a way of expressing uncertainty without feeling it undermines their expertise. Voicing doubt has been allowed to become a synonym for admitting you were wrong. The way out is to stop insisting that you were right in the first place. The scientific consensus on climate change is real. But by insisting on its merits for the purposes of politics, its champions have exposed it to ridicule. Political arguments for climate science – indeed, for any science – in the age of Trump should not keep saying that the populists are lying about the consensus. They should say that they are hypocrites about the doubt: they do not practise what they preach because they think they know the answers already. Climate change deniers argue they are only trying to discover the truth. We should all be sceptical about that.

Ibrahimovic’s scrappy goal was enough to give victory to a United team that only looked like a United team in patches. Mostly there were stodgy and unimaginative. 90 min: Kamenyuka booked for a foul on Rashford. Freekick to United wide on the left. They’ll run down the clock, which is ticking towards Zzzzzzzzz.... 89 min: Martial wins a freekick. Ibrahimovic curls it into the keeper’s arms from 25 yards. 88 min: Paulinho digs out a cross from near the left-hand corner flag. Lipartia gets his nut to it, but Romero makes a comfortable save. 87 min: United defending deep to hold on to their lead... 85 min: Rooney delivers an outswinging corner. Fellaini volleys over. 84 min: Ibrahimovic switches play to Rooney on the right. Prime counter-attacking chance. But Rooney donks the ball way beyond Rashford. His touch remains scruffy. 83 min: Bailly cuts out a cross by Petryak. But Zorya come again ... 82 min: Zorya are not out of this yet. Zorya substitution: Gordyienko on, Chaycovsky off. 79 min: Turns out it wasn’t interesting at all. Lipartia curled the freekick way over the bar. 78 min: Aye, aye, this could be interesting. Zorya have a freekick a few of yards outside the United box following a foul by Fellaini. Zorya substitutions: Lipartia on, Ljubenovic off. 75 min: Elsewhere, in case you’re interested, Dundalk are deservedly leading 1-0 against Maccaabi Tel Aviv. What a season they’re having. United substitutions: Young and Martial on, Mata and Fosu-Mensah off. The latter had a particularly good game. 71 min: The goal should settle United down. OK, that’s just something people say; fact is United looked settled to the point of idleness for most of the match. Still, the goal could lead to more opportunities if Zorya decide to loosen up in the search for an equaliser. Fosu-Mensah created it down the right, swapping passes before picking out Rooney in space 10 yards in front of goal. Rooney fluffed his shot but it ran to Ibrahimovic, who buried it from close range. That’ll go down as an assist for Rooney. Let that be a warning to anyone who swears by statistics. United substitution: Rooney on, Lingard off. Mata shifts wide. The stage is set ... 65 min: Freekick to Zorya in a dangerous position, wide on the right, in line with the 18-yard line. It’s pinged in to the danger zone but Ibrahimovic heads it away. Zorya gets it back and work an opening for Paulinho, who sends a curler towards the far corner from 16 yards. Romero flings himself across his line to push it away. 63 min: Bailly booked for a raising his foot high to make a tackle. Not nasty but not allowed. 62 min: Excellent tackle by Fellaini to regain possession as Zorya tried to mount a counter. Pogba then tried to thread a pass through to Lingard. It was a fine attempt but foiled by an even better interception by Sobol. 61 min: Cross by Lingard. Easy catch for the keeper, whose name I’ll check as soon as he gets something difficult to do (OK, it’s Shevchenko). Zorya substitution: Paulinho on, Kulach off 57 min: United need Carrick now. Fellaini can be dispensed with. Pogba could be withdrawn as well, to be fair. He’s been far too peripheral. 55 min: Fosu-Mensah gets forward down the right then passes to Lingard. The winger pings a low cross into the six-yard box, but the keeper cuts it out. 54 min: “United, United” shout a smattering of the home fans in a pleading tone. 52 min: A tame United attack breaks down, Petryak lashes on to the ball and skins Fellaini down the left before going down under a challenge by the Belgian, though I’m not sure there was any contact. The visitors have been the better side so far in this half. 50 min: More sloppiness from United, this time by Rojo. His error gifts Zorya a chance to cross from the right, which they duly do. But the ensuing header is weak. Lucky United. 48 min: Pogba gives away possession in midfield and fails to win it back. Zorya tear forward, Sobol flying down the left. He plays it in-field to Petryak, who decides to try to play it back to Sobol rather than drive into the area. An uncharacteristically poor decision. 47 min: In this group’s other match Fenerbahce are beating Feyenoord 1-0. That kicked off at the same time as this one, which was about six hours ago I think. 46 min: Let’s try again. “Chaykovsky? It sounds like United will need a Nutcracker to prise open this opponent!” says Peter Oh, because someone had to. “This is a far superior cover of The Sound of Silence,” insists Armor O’Malley, who’s not wrong. United were ponderous for much of that half but perked up towards the break - playing with more speed and a touch of unpredictability - and the strain began to show on the unheralded visitors, who, until then, had been tidy, dynamic and quite dangerous on the break. If they continue in this vein in the second half they will eventually edge in front, but the risk of an upset remains for now. 43 min: United have increased the tempo and are starting to stretch the visitors, who are beginning to look in need of half-time. 41 min: Fellaini gets his head to a corner without even jumping. He powers a header downward from seven yards ... but it bounces up over the bar. 40 min: Rojo plays a lovely cross - yes! - to Lingard, whose header is deflected out for a corner. 38 min: Yelps! Actual yelps of delight as United create a chance! It came from a dash into the box by Mata, who was served by a lovely cross from the right by Pogba. But the Spaniard steered his header just wide from 12 yards. 36 min: The band Disturbed copied a song about the atmosphere at Old Trafford on European nights such as this. Here it is: 33 min: United continue to stroke the ball about in front of Zorya. No hint of a breakthrough. 31 min: Ibrahimovic falls to the ground in the vicinity of a defender. The ref, possibly star-struck, awards a freekick. Ibrahimovic clambers to his feet to take it. And bogs it straight into the wall. 28 min: Pogba shows some initiative, making a run from midfield into the box. Mata spots him and tries to drop a long pass in front of him. It’s slightly too long, allowing the keeper to come claim it. But it was a good idea, and United haven’t had many of those so far. They’ve been predictable and their only real chance came from a corner. 26 min: Bailly dives in to concede a freekick wide on the left. Grechyshkin’s delivery is plod. 23 min: Zorya are very nimble technicians and exceedingly well drilled and determined. There’s every sign that they are capable not only of frustrating United but beating them. There’s not much creativity or pace in this United side at the moment. Pogba isn’t pulling many strings at the moment. 20 min: Pogba meets a corner from the same position as he scored his goal against Leicester, but this time his header is not clean. But the ball runs towards the edge of the area, where Rashford arrives like a train and smashes a ferocious shot off against the crossbar! 19 min: Ibrahimovic has a blast from 25 yards. It cannons off a defender and out for a corner. 18 min: Fosu-Mensah tries a direct approach, flighting a good long pass into the penalty box. The only problem with his plan, however, was that Mata was never going to win the header against two centrebacks. 15 min: United are looking stodgy. They’ve yet to find the pace or imagination to infiltrate a very well organised Ukrainian team, who, in contrast, have real verve on the break. I can’t see the dugout, but Mourinho’s thunderous disposition is unlikely to have cleared. 13 min: Zorya give another demonstration of their counter-attacking skill. Petryak, a nippy schemer, zips in from the left and then slips a pass wide to Chaykovsky. His dangerous cross is headed away at the near post by Smalling. 10 min: Nice zigzag passing between Mata and Lingard down the right, followed by a decent cross from Mata. Well defended by Zorya. 9 min: Fellaini heads over from a Mata corner. 7 min: Pogba sprays a long diagonal pass wide to Rashford on the right. Rashford traps it nicely and then dashes past the defender before running into trouble. 5 min: The first chance of the game is created by Zorya. Petriak lashed in behind Rashford and Fosu-Mensah and cut a cross back to Ljubenovic. The forward is 16 yards out and has a clear view of goal. But excitement overcomes him and he skies his shot! 3 min: Already a pattern has become clear: Zorya are massed deep behind the ball, allowing United to knock it about in front of them. This is actually a test for United, then, because without Blind, Carrick or Herrera, there are questions about their ability to build from deep. Bailly and Smalling don’t do it and nor does Fellaini. 1 min: We have kickoff! United begin what they hope will be 90 minutes of dominance. The teams take to the pitch. United are wearing their usual home kit. Zorya Luhansk, Cure fans to a man, are dressed all in black. Mourinho has a face like thunder, which has been his default expression for over a year now. Mourinho could have rested the world’s most expensive player, of course, but the inclusion of Pogba suggests that he wants as many opportunities as possible to assess the player and figure out how best he can fit into the team. You’d have thought he’d have had a clear idea of that before buying him but that wasn’t evident at the start of the season. Last weekend, however, Pogba played in something close to a playmaker role, and the manager will presumably want to see how well he can pull strings tonight. Scholes reckons that Mourinho should have deployed the same team that did so well against Leicester last weekend because that is a formula that should be given time to gel. It’s a fair point but this match is one of the opportunities in a hectic season to give players a rest so it makes sense to leave a couple out, especially full-backs given the amount of ground they have to cover. Paul Scholes, a-punditing on BT, says of Rooney’s bench duty: “He’s not in great form at the minute and it’s the right time to leave him out. They’ve got an easy game tonight and it could be an easy game on Sunday. When the big games come around he’ll be back.” Poor Stoke. Guess that’s his point. “What do you mean there are no defenders on the bench?” demands Elijah Miranda. “Surely you recall Carrick making a hash of it as an emergency centreback nd Ashley Young as our starting leftback under LVG? Defenders Galore!” “Why did Mourinho give a contract extension to Carrick to leave him on the bench?” fumes Brian Kitt. Carrick has the vision and precision to move United forward with the speed and menace that their fans demand but not on a regular basis so he must be preserved for certain matches. But by being around the club he has tutor the younger midfielders so that they may do his thing when he can’t. That, at any rate, is one possible reason for the extension. Another may be that Mourinho envisages using him more frequently as the season progresses. The player himself did not seem to perturbed when asked about the matter after his excellent performance against Northampton last week. “The manager knows what I can do ... Sometimes players play, sometimes they don’t, that’s how it is. Everyone needs to calm down a bit,” he said. “No manager in their right mind can start Rojo in a match and truly want to win it!” storms Jiffy. Come, come: Shaw is injured and Blind needs a rest before facing Stoke’s Shqiri and Arnautovic this weekend. Blind has become increasingly important to Mourinho, who didn’t seem to fancy him at first, and he’ll welcome the chance to give him a rest. And Rojo deserves another chance to impress ... potential January buyers. “Tens of mbm readers? Ha!” snorts Ian Copestake. “Say hi from me to the other one.” Hi mum! So what do you make of United’s lineup? As expected, Rooney is on the (defender-free) bench. Mourinho’s spin yesterday was that it would be a risk to the player’s confidence to deploy him at the moment, especially as he had a back niggle earlier in the week. But this match would surely have been an excellent chance for Rooney to bang in a goal or two and restore that confidence. The probability, then, is that Mourinho would prefer Ibrahimovic to avail of that chance because the Swede will be more important to United this season than Rooney will. And Ibrahimovic could do with a good performance because he’s been sub-standard in recent outings, raising tentative questions as to his ability to sustain the bright form he showed at the very start of his United career.

Hello and welcome to a meeting of unequals. Manchester United are embarrassed to be in the Europa League again, whereas Zorya Luhansk are thrilled to be in it for the first time ever. A win for the Ukrainian club would make this one of the most memorable nights in both clubs’ histories for very different reasons. But that seems a highly unlikely outcome, unless Jose Mourinho secretly wants his team to be eliminated so he can be rid of a pesky competition and concentrate on getting back into the Champions League via the Premier League. On the face of things, however, Mourinho is deadset on victory, both to make up some of the ground lost against Feyenoord in the first group game and to avert another outbreak of the negativity with which he says some of his tender young players struggle to cope. United are expected to field a strong lineup and we’ll go through it as soon as it’s revealed. In the meantime, here’s Jonathan Wilson on Zorya Luhansk’s success in exile: “I’m very pleased with the fact that United sent their scout to watch our game against Vorskla,” the Zorya Luhansk coach, Yuriy Vernydub, said this week, which makes a change from those managers who try desperately to hide themselves away from future opponents. “Before, they used to say that no one knew about Zorya, whereas now scouts are watching our boys. It means that the players deserve that.” Zorya have particular reason to want to be known: their very existence in European competition feels like a triumph. In June 2014, the Ukrainian club were forced to flee Luhansk because of the conflict with pro-Russia separatists who founded the Luhansk People’s Republic. Zorya’s home ground, the Avangard Stadium, suffered heavy shelling. They moved to Zaporizhzhya, 400km to the south-west, where they play home games at the Slavutych Arena. Its address, just over the road from the Museum of the History of Warfare on Bulvar Lobanovskoho, gives an indication of Zaporizhzhya’s main place in Ukrainian football history: it was there in May 2002, leading his Dynamo Kyiv side against Metalurh, that Valeriy Lobanovskyicollapsed in the dug-out, dying a few days later in hospital. Vernydub’s spirit of openness also makes a significant change from how things used to be in Zaporizhzhya. In Soviet times it was closed down because of its role in the energy industry, the site of both Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and a huge hydroelectric dam (Zaporizhzhya means “beyond the rapids”).

Nationwide celebrations started after iftar, the evening meal to break the day’s Ramadan fast, and lasted almost until sunrise, when many have another meal to prepare for the next day’s abstinence. The streets of Tehran, including the tree-lined Vali-e-Asr, which stretches from the north to the south of the capital, saw scenes of extraordinary jubilation as people gathered outside, with drivers honking car horns and people pushing the boundaries to dance and sing in public, in a country where such behaviour is normally banned. It was a rare moment in which the Iranian people and their government were largely on the same side celebrating what they see as a national achievement. Celebrations were not only limited to Tehran; other major cities, including Shiraz, and even Bushehr, which is host to a nuclear power plant, saw similar reactions. Crowds held up the green, white and red flag of Iran and congratulated each other by making “V for victory” signs and waving from open windows. The Iranian police had announced before the deal that it would “accompany” people in these celebrations. Many held up posters depicting the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s lead nuclear negotiator, who has become a national hero. On Wednesday, Zarif was greeted by senior officials and figures when hereturned to Iran. Among them were the family members of assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists, showing that the deal has garnered support even among conservatives. One Iranian newspaper, Ebtekar, put Zarif’s picture on its front page next to a picture of Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran’s respected first democratically elected prime minister who was overthrown by a British and CIA-engineered coup in 1953. Sipri, a thinktank in Sweden famous for its reports on global arms sales, has recommended Zarif and his American counterpart, John Kerry, for a Nobel peace prize. The nuclear accord dominated all other Iranian front pages and almost all welcomed it. “The world changed”, read the headline of the reformist Etemaad. Shargh, another reformist daily, carried the headline: “Victory without war”. Asia published a front page with a one-word headline against a white background: “Deal”. Arman daily said: “The world came to respect Iran”. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, thanked Iranian negotiators for their efforts during a meeting with government officials, hinting at his approval of the agreement. He is expected to give his verdict in detail when he delivers a speech when he leads Friday prayers in Tehran. There were also positive reactions to the Guardian’s editorial in Farsi, which hailed “a triumph of diplomacy”. Many Iranian state agencies reported the editorial, with some Iranian news sites publishing the full text. One Tehrani citizen said many were sharing it online and via messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Iranian cartoonists also reacted: one showed Iranian negotiators raising a national flag, alluding to the iconic photograph showing US soldiers raising the stars and stripes on Iwo Jima. Another cartoon by prominent Iranian cartoonist Mana Neyestani showed a dove of peace breaking the window of a bunker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/may/17/shell-video-competition-row-dont-mention-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-17T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"'Don't mention the Arctic': Shell embarrassed by video competition row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/17/shell-video-competition-row-dont-mention-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/may/17/shell-video-competition-row-dont-mention-arctic","fields":{"headline":"'Don't mention the Arctic': Shell embarrassed by video competition row","bodyText":"Shell has been caught in an embarrassing spat over its plan for a $50,000 (£31,727) video competition aimed at 18-34-year-olds to promote its view that the world still needs fossil fuels despite climate change. The film project is being developed in partnership with US-based online ad agency Zooppa, and, according to a leaked email, was to be pitched at platforms such as Vice, the online news service. An email between Zooppa staff discussing the Shell brief makes it clear “you should NOT mention on your storyboard Arctic Oil”. Environmentalists say Shell’s involvement in exploiting reserves in the Arctic undermines its attempt to portray itself as a responsible oil and gas company keen to tackle global warming. While references to the Arctic are ruled out, the memo says “you can mention instead oil, gas, wind, nuclear energy”. Greenpeace – which received the leaked email – believes the competition is being run in a bid to influence younger people in the runup to critical climate change talks convened by the United Nations in Paris in December. The email appears to be written by one Zooppa staffer to another giving advice about how to approach the project after “I met on Monday with the Shell team”. While the Anglo-Dutch group has insisted it needs to drill off Alaska this summer as part of an effort to see whether it can find oil and replenish the world’s reserves, the email suggests Shell realises its operations in the Chukchi Sea could lose it support. A Shell spokesman said: “We said in our brief that we wanted to get these films noticed by Vice, but we didn’t expect it to happen this way. At no point was any direction given by Shell to our agency to advise entrants against mentioning the Arctic in their films. We’ve taken the agency outside and given it a stern talking to, and it is now absolutely clear on this. “Anyway, there’s no censorship, no boundaries other than the pretty basic ones set out in the brief, just a strong desire to get people thinking creatively about how to challenge preconceptions that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have no part in our future energy lives, and how to communicate the reality of the future energy system. That system will include renewables, nuclear power and oil and gas, including from the Arctic, which is already a major source of energy.” Zooppa declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/apr/26/not-a-year-went-by-without-a-chernobyl-funeral-30-years-since-disaster-hit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-26T09:53:13Z","webTitle":"'Not a year went by without a Chernobyl funeral': 30 years since disaster hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/not-a-year-went-by-without-a-chernobyl-funeral-30-years-since-disaster-hit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/apr/26/not-a-year-went-by-without-a-chernobyl-funeral-30-years-since-disaster-hit","fields":{"headline":"'Not a year went by without a Chernobyl funeral': 30 years since disaster hit","bodyText":"On 26 April 1986 one of four nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded, triggering the biggest nuclear catastrophe in history. Some living nearby found their lives changed almost immediately, for others across Europe it would be weeks or months until the full scale of the human and environmental disaster was realised. As the world marks the 30 year anniversary, we asked people to share their memories about the day the disaster hit. From the evacuee living in the nearby town of Pripyat to the daughter of a first responder who saw many colleagues die and a farmer from the Netherlands whose business was ruined, these are their stories. Evacuee Dmitrij Sribnyj, 35, Peterborough, UK. Then, Pripyat I was born in Pripyat, 2km away from the power plant, and lived there with my grandparents. I was five years old when the disaster hit. One of my earliest memories is the morning after the explosion. My grandparents were talking about a very loud bang they had heard during the night, it was on the radio too, but nobody seemed clear what was actually going on. I’m not sure why, but that day we went to our summer garden, close to the power plant. I could see a lot of smoke surrounding the tower and helicopters circling. I remember seeing one land on the riverside, where I used to go fishing with my grandfather, and fly to the power plant to drop sand on the burning reactor. The next day it was announced we must leave the town, but that it wouldn’t be for long. We were told to only take documents and the things we’d need for a few days. Leaving town our column of buses passed nobody apart from several army vehicles on their way to the plant. It was then I think my grandmother realised and said “we are not going back”. After two weeks staying with a family in a nearby village I was taken to Lithuania, then part of the Soviet Union, where my parents were settling. My father worked at another nuclear power plant in Visaginas – then Snechkus – and they were waiting to be assigned a family home. Later it was officially announced that it would not be possible to return to Pripyat due to the high levels of radiation and my grandparents moved to Vologda, their hometown in Russia. I finished school in Lithuania before moving to the UK. Pripyat has been a ghost town for 30 years now – I have not been back since I was evacuated, but I would love to one day. Daughter of KGB first responder Genia, 31, London. Then, Kiev My dad worked for the KGB’s first response unit and on the morning of 27 April he received instructions to join evacuation efforts in Pripyat. We lived in Kiev, 130km away. I was only one at the time so don’t have any recollections of my own but I grew up with the stories which have been re-lived every April for 30 years. No one realised the gravity of the incident immediately, but the fact my dad’s instructions from Moscow were covered in the highest level of secrecy raised the alarm. Things carried on as normal a few days after the disaster and we attended a huge parade through the streets on 1 May – but soon after my mother would take me, my sister and three other children of family friends to Chernovtsy, a town in the relatively safe west of the country. By that time she said there was a strong burning wind coming from the north that “felt like it carried millions of tiny glass shards.” By 2 May, when she was boarding the train with us, hundreds of others were trying to escape. By then it was panic. My dad stayed and continued his daily trips to the evacuation zone – first just Pripyat, then a 5km radius, then 10km, then 30km. It took 20 years before he agreed to talk about what happened. He arrived at the explosion site early in the afternoon on 27 April. By then most of the firefighters and plant workers had been sent home: some had already died from radiation exposure. The army commanders gave the orders: the priority was to collect the waste. There were no radioactive suits or protective gear, not even gloves. Most died within hours. The evacuation [of the residents living near the plant] did not go well either, many refused to leave their homes, some fought to stay, some hid. My father, now 62, said that those who stayed were almost certainly sentenced to death. Not a year went by in our family without a Chernobyl funeral. Mostly my dad’s colleagues and friends. Last year the last remaining person to work with him in the contamination zone died. My dad also has an incurable condition, but it was never a choice, just something he says he had to do.Every Ukrainian has a similar story to tell. No one will ever forget the carelessness of this disaster and its aftermath. If the explosion was an accident, albeit avertible, the decision to delay the communication and evacuation, as well as deliberately concealing the health dangers – were calculated actions by the government. In the late 1990s there were a couple of charity funds set up for European families to host Chernobyl kids over the summer. I was welcomed by a generous Swiss family in France when I was 14 and I returned again after high school. I moved to London in 2006 but my family is still in Ukraine – which is still my home. Former farmer Margo van der Voort, 63, Melbourne. Then, the Netherlands It was the first spring weekend that we were able to spend time outside after a long cold winter on our farm close to the German border in the Netherlands. We had friends over and celebrated with long walks and meals outside as we harvested rocket, radishes and kale. It was happy and healthy weekend, we thought – until we heard the news about the nuclear disaster. Soon after, the police appeared holding megaphones summoning everyone to get their livestock off the fields. They ordered us to stay indoors, with windows and doors closed. We listened to radio and watched TV reports for our instructions, how to protect ourselves from radiation, what it looked like or how we could recognise it. A health minister said there was no immediate risk and that in six months any trace of radiation would be gone. I did my own research, and found many questions. Why were the police out in force to clear the land of livestock? Why were farmers forced to destroy their milk supply? And was there radiation the rain? Our farm was registered as a Demeter biodynamic farm so our soil was regularly tested. Three weeks after the disaster, scientists found Caesium 137. This was a personal and business disaster for us. We lost the certification we had worked for 10 years to get and had to destroy our harvest. It was the end of our livelihood as we knew it. The conflicting advice from authorities was disorientating and infuriating. They clearly had no emergency plans for a nuclear disaster. We felt increasingly lied to. After six months of uncertainty with our business and lives in tatters, my partner moved back to Australia. I followed in 1988. No authorities in the Netherlands offered any compensation for our losses. The Dutch government failed to acknowledge its seriousness. Now, 30 years later, it seems all but forgotten. Ukranian (name witheld), 38, Leeds, UK. Then, Odessa I was nine and living in Odessa, Ukraine. I don’t remember anything on the news when it actually happened, then slowly some disjointed reporting of a fire in Chernobyl started to appear. As a child it didn’t feel dangerous or particularly important, though lots of things in my daily life changed. Rumours started to spread that all soft fruit was radioactive. My grandmother stopped buying it. I always ate my apples and pears whole, with the core and seeds, and suddenly I was told off for doing it. I remember running outside and playing with my friend when it started to rain, and then my friend’s mum running out after us, screaming hysterically “you can’t play in the rain anymore or your hair will fall off.” The leaves on the trees turned yellow and dark brown really early. I remember poplars standing bare in the middle of summer, butit was a year or maybe longer, that we realised the scale of the disaster. Rumours circulated about children with tumours. A few years later my mum had several cysts removed from her breasts and womb. It is hard to say if this was caused by the disaster, but it is possible. As more details emerged it became apparent how unprepared the Ukraine was for a large-scale environmental catastrophe. There was no organised public appeal for volunteers to house refugees or give donations.It is sad that people died of radiation exposure because they did not take simple precautions: they were not told what kind of fire they were putting out. Resettler Vasyl Sokirenko, Chernobyl I first moved to Chernobyl in 1990, enticed by the salary I was offered as a police officer: it was twice what I would’ve earned outside the exclusion zone. After eight years here I retired and moved back to my hometown, Sumy, in the north east of Ukraine, but didn’t last long. I was sitting in a fifth-floor apartment listening to the noise of the highway with nothing to do but drink and watch TV. So I decided to move back, it’s officially illegal, but after some negotiation with officials I managed to make it happen. I live in an abandoned property, grow vegetables and keep bees. It’s a nice cottage with lots of space for what I need to do. The former owners, who now live in Crimea, came back to visit once. They saw me, but there was no problem – in fact they were happy I had moved in. Without me, the house would be in ruins. There are now about 160 of us resettlers here, all of us retired. I feel free here. I test what I eat and it’s all fine, and when summer arrives and the garden is in full bloom it will be self-evident why I chose to come back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/16/george-osbornes-red-carpet-treatment-china","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T18:31:12Z","webTitle":"George Osborne's red carpet treatment of China stores big rewards, and big risks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/16/george-osbornes-red-carpet-treatment-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/16/george-osbornes-red-carpet-treatment-china","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne's red carpet treatment of China stores big rewards, and big risks","bodyText":"The ancient Silk Road, along which caravans of traders brought fine Chinese cloths and exquisite porcelain to markets across Asia, never stretched as far as chilly Britain. But George Osborne is determined that its 21st-century successor will terminate in London. China’s plan to step up renminbi-denominated trading in the City is just the latest evidence of what the chancellor hopes will be a “golden era” of economic and financial cooperation between China and the UK. As Beijing presses ahead with its “One Belt, One Road” policy: a strategic plan to establish a new Silk Road, through central Asia and beyond, Osborne believes he has put the UK in a good position to participate. Next week’s state visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping will be the culmination of a long period of determined diplomacy, including the chancellor’s recent week-long tour of the country, which included six other ministers. Gerard Lyons, an advisor to the Mayor of London and a long-time China-watcher, said that by trying to make London China’s offshore financial centre of choice, the UK was playing to its strengths. While the volume of renminbi trading is relatively small at present, he said: “It makes sense for the UK to do whatever it can to facilitate the trading of renminbi in London.” Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said: “In recent years, cooperation between the UK and China in the financial services sector has been particularly strong and has benefitted greatly from government support on both sides.” In the earlier stages of China’s economic miracle, Germany made the running in exploiting huge Chinese demand, supplying the fast-growing economy with capital goods such as machine tools, as it invested billions of dollars in infrastructure. As countries develop economically, however, they tend to shift towards consumption of more services, including the financial and business services – accountancy, consulting, law – in which the UK has long specialised. Despite the recent downturn in the Chinese economy, including its stock market crash, which sparked panic worldwide and much alarm among policymakers who fear the country will export its problems, Osborne believes that in the long run, the UK will benefit by being ready to supply China’s needs. He has made it his business to befriend Beijing, even when it has meant irking the UK’s other partners. Britain infuriated Washington by being the first western country to sign up for membership of China’s new development lender, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for example. Kristin Forbes, a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, backed Osborne’s approach in a speech on Friday, urging British businesses to forge deeper links with China. The Bank’s rate-setting committee member said: “Just one country – China – has been responsible for over one-third of global GDP growth since 2011, and even after incorporating its recent slowing, is still expected to drive about 35% of global growth this year.” She added: “Any business looking at growth opportunities should be considering these regions that are responsible – by far – for the biggest contributions to global growth,” Forbes told the Brighton and Hove Chamber of Commerce. Opportunities in the Chinese market for British exporters have already expanded rapidly in recent years. Jonathan Ashworth, of Morgan Stanley, said: “If you include Hong Kong, China is now the UK’s sixth-biggest export market and the third-largest source of imports. Moreover, China is now the top export market for several sectors such as car manufacturing and higher education, and is growing rapidly in tourism.” As well as trade links, the Treasury has made clear its enthusiasm for attracting Chinese direct investment, not just in building the next generation of UK nuclear facilities, but on some of the many projects that form part of Osborne’s northern powerhouse plan, including HS2 and even housing developments in Sheffield and Leeds. In recent years, Chinese companies have been busy buying up internationally renowned brands and landmarks, including New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, the former headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank and, in the UK, the venerable Weetabix. Alex White, country analysis director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “The broader context is that China is shifting from being a net importer of capital to a net exporter of capital,” he said. “By 2017, China will be investing more overseas than the rest of the world is investing in China.” Labour has questioned the chancellor’s approach, raising China’s poor human rights record and warning of the security risks that might emerge as a result of allowing China to invest in strategic assets, such as nuclear power. But there are economic risks, too: the more closely the UK is entangled with the Chinese economy, the greater the impact if, as some analysts fear, the country is on the brink of a deep downturn. Ashworth points out that UK banks’ exposure to China is already considerably higher than the banks of other major economies. White says: “It is probably reasonable for the UK to bet on China. But it’s not completely out of the question that the Chinese economy might go through a very hard landing and obviously, the more interconnected you are, the greater the risks from that.” But for the time being, nothing will deter Osborne from rolling out the red carpet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2015/oct/02/guardian-live-will-the-market-save-us","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-02T09:57:49Z","webTitle":"Guardian Live: will the market save us?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2015/oct/02/guardian-live-will-the-market-save-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2015/oct/02/guardian-live-will-the-market-save-us","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Live: will the market save us?","bodyText":"The late Nobel prize-winning economist, Milton Friedman, once described free-market capitalism as “the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another”. Yet since the 2008 financial crash, this understanding has come in for intense criticism from those who believe that unregulated markets are the cause of - rather than the solution to - many of society’s problems. So, can we rely on markets to save us? At a Guardian Live/ Discuss event at the People’s History Museum in Manchester, Steve Davies, education director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, went head-to-head with Catriona Watson, founder of the Post-Crash Economics Society at the University of Manchester. Yes - the markets can save us Davies began by arguing that the financial crisis was an entirely foreseeable event which, far from exposing the failure of unregulated markets, arose out of a misunderstanding of how markets ought to work. “What lay behind [the crash] was a belief that the world was more controllable, more predictable than it actually is,” he explained. “What policymakers didn’t understand was that you’re dealing with a world of radical uncertainty in which you ultimately have to have a system based on profit and loss. That’s what capitalism is based on.” The problem, according to Davies, was that too many people believed any losses they incurred from poor investments would be subsidised by the taxpayer. This led to reckless investments that ultimately caused the global financial crisis. Furthermore, if market principles had been followed, governments would have done what Iceland did and allow financial institutions to go bust. “A tough choice,” he admitted, “but the right one because, once it’s done, we can get over the bad investment caused by the artificial boom.” While the short-term effects would have been disastrous for ordinary people with savings in bankrupt banks, longer term the void would have been filled by another central tenet of Davies’ market ideology: innovation. “What drives market economies is innovation and what we’re seeing right now is an unprecedented wave in innovation in the way commerce is organised through things like sharing economies such as Airbnb.” No - we need people and institutions to create a fairer society Watson - who has campaigned against rigid economics curriculums at UK universities - wasn’t convinced, arguing that the profit-driven higher education sector provides as good an example of the limitations of markets. “In order to market education, you need to turn it into a commodity,” she said. “It’s the market mechanism of minimising marginal costs for maximum gain for the university as a business rather than looking at how we’re going to give these students a good education.” According to Watson, market pressures mean university economics departments are failing to create well-rounded students who are able to engage with related subjects, such as politics and social sciences. Consequently, students who graduate in subjects like economics are often ill-equipped to deal with global problems such as the 2008 financial crisis. Asked by an audience member whether the market could ever be used to create a better society, Watson was sceptical: “People and institutions need to use markets to build a society where appropriate but the market won’t do it by itself,” she said. “Markets don’t have an aim - they respond to incentives and behaviour. It’s not a conscious thing that can achieve things like building a fairer society; it’s institutions and people who will do that.” Another audience member asked about social enterprises which, according to one study, are growing faster than mainstream businesses by responding to the ethical demands of consumers: “Is the market fixing itself and becoming more ethical?” “Yes, quite possibly,” Davies replied. “Entrepreneurs and people in the business world are going to respond to incentives and if there’s demand for ethical products they’ll do that. Also the change in technology is making it much easier to fund, start and organise alternative business models.” Yet despite his unbridled positivity, Davies conceded one snag. While markets are efficient drivers of economic growth, they are not as good at establishing social justice and equality. “Very often in society you need to make a choice between greater efficiency and output on the one hand and some principle of equity on the other. What you’ve got to realise is that there is a trade-off. Too many people think they can have their cake and eat it.” For many in the audience, this trade-off was too much. A straw poll following the debate found 70% disagreed with the motion with only 30% leaving the hall convinced that markets can save us. The next Guardian Live/Discuss event takes place on 29 October, with the motion: Nuclear power? Yes please."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/22/uk-nuclear-ambitions-dealt-fatal-blow-by-austrian-legal-challenge-say-greens","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-22T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear ambitions dealt fatal blow by Austrian legal challenge, say Greens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/22/uk-nuclear-ambitions-dealt-fatal-blow-by-austrian-legal-challenge-say-greens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/22/uk-nuclear-ambitions-dealt-fatal-blow-by-austrian-legal-challenge-say-greens","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear ambitions dealt fatal blow by Austrian legal challenge, say Greens","bodyText":"Plans for a new generation of nuclear reactors in the UK have been dealt a fatal blow by Austria’s decision to launch a legal challenge to the EU’s approval of a £17.6bn subsidy deal, according to the Green Party. On Wednesday, the Guardian revealed that Austria will appeal the EU’s decision last year to approve the subsidy deal between the UK government and EDF for Hinkley Point C. Hinkley would be the first new nuclear reactor in Britain for two decades if built, although it would come with a price tag of £24.5bn and electricity generated from the plant would be paid double the market rate through levies raised on household energy bills. But no final investment decision has yet been signed and legal delays now seem likely to prevent the government from realising its ambition for Hinkley to produce 7% of the nation’s electricity by 2023. “I think that this [Austrian] court case is certainly going to delay the signing and also the construction of Hinkley,” said Molly Scott Cato, the Green Party MEP for the South West region, which includes Hinkley. “As one of the government’s main arguments for Hinkley was that it would solve the ‘energy gap’ before renewables could be brought onstream, it is a fatal blow to Hinkley as part of a future energy strategy for the UK.” It was David Cameron who first described the signing of the Hinkley deal as marking “the next generation of nuclear power in Britain”, for its ability to meet energy demand and contribute to long-term security of supply. Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, said that such claims now seemed risible. “I think we have seen the final generation of nuclear power, I am very pleased to say,” she told the Guardian. “It’s gone, it’s dusted. Lets focus on evidence-based renewables and energy conservation futures.” Lawyers say that while a court case over the EU’s decision that the Hinkley subsidies were legal could take two years, the appeals process could drag proceedings on for substantially longer. “A court process that kicks off in May would take a minimum of two years and if it goes into appeals, you’d then be looking at another two years. So it could be a minimum of three and a maximum of four years or longer,” said Dr Dörte Fouquet, a lawyer for the Brussels-based lawfirm Becker Büttner Held, which specialises in energy and competition law. Austria’s chances of success were “pretty high,” she said, because there were no grounds for giving such state aid under EU treaty law and Austria would question the common European interest in building a nuclear power plant in the UK. Part of the UK’s case, accepted by the European Commission, is that nuclear energy is entitled to state aid as a ‘market failure’ because no private sector investment would be feasible until 2030 at the earliest. The premium offered to EDF is thus considered “reasonable” in light of potential risks, and because the state aid involved would not confer any additional advantages to the company. ‘The UK is confident that the state aid case for Hinkley Point C is legally robust and we vigorously support the European Commission’s defence of its decision last year,” a Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman told the Guardian. “This brings us one step closer to seeing new nuclear as part of our future low carbon energy mix.” “We have no reason to believe that Austria, or any other party, is preparing a case which has any merit,” he added. The Decc office did not respond to questions about the effect that a lengthy court case might have on cost over-runs or a final investment decision. The renewables industry has bridled at what some see as double-standards in EU decisions last year denying state aid to renewable energy in Germany, while allowing it for nuclear in the UK. “It’s puzzling why the European Commission has decided to have a set of rules for one energy source and entirely different set for another,” said European Wind Energy Association spokesman Oliver Joy. “If we want a level playing field for all energy forms in the EU then we need common standards that allow all technologies to compete on an equal footing.” The Ukip MEP and energy spokesman, Roger Helmer, offered strong support for nuclear energy, qualified only by a caveat that the government’s Hinkley deal had been “excessively expensive” because of regulatory uncertainty from Brussels. “Given that Hinkley is a trailblazer for the new generation of nuclear and now looks like being held up for a long period of time, it will be extremely damaging - not just for nuclear but across the whole spectrum of industry,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/15/human-rights-chinese-ambassador-xi-jinping-uk-state-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-15T18:30:43Z","webTitle":"Don't interfere on human rights, says Chinese envoy before Xi's UK visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/15/human-rights-chinese-ambassador-xi-jinping-uk-state-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/15/human-rights-chinese-ambassador-xi-jinping-uk-state-visit","fields":{"headline":"Don't interfere on human rights, says Chinese envoy before Xi's UK visit","bodyText":"China’s president, Xi Jinping, would feel offended if his five-day state visit to Britain was used to raise the subject of Beijing’s human rights record, China’s ambassador to the UK has said. Liu Xiaoming said Britain was fast becoming the leader of the western countries with the best relations with China, and said he expected Xi’s visit to “herald a golden era for the relationship”. But Liu suggested the president would not respond well if reprimanded on human rights during his visit. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has already promised to raise human rights issues next week, probably at a state banquet organised by the Queen. He has also been afforded a meeting with the Chinese leader at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening before the banquet. No 10 will be desperate that Corbyn does not make his views known in a way that offends the Chinese or jeopardises much-needed Chinese investments in UK infrastructure, including its nuclear power plants. Amnesty International has promised demonstrations in London in protest at China’s human rights record. The group said: “The [Chinese] government has ratcheted up censorship of the internet, clamped down on civil society, increased its ideological controls over the media and academia, and launched several large-scale crackdowns on human rights defenders, lawyers, and activists. “Most recently at least 245 lawyers and activists have been targeted in an unprecedented nationwide campaign over the last 100 days and at least 30 are ‘missing’ or still in police custody.” The Chinese ambassador told a press conference: “We don’t shy away from talking about human rights. What we are against is to use human rights to interfere with other countries’ internal affairs and to try to impose your own system on to others.” Liu said British people would feel offended if China lectured Britain on human rights. “Likewise,” he added. There were reports that the Prince of Wales, a friend of the Dalai Lama, would boycott the state banquet, although Clarence House said the prince would attend a lunch with the president and take tea with Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan. David Cameron and George Osborne have done all they can to strengthen relations with Beijing since 2012, when diplomatic relations nosedived after the prime minister met the Dalai Lama in London. Both men will be spending huge amounts of time with the president, both in formal talks at Downing Street, then at Chequers and finally in Manchester. Liu said Britain was “coming up from behind” after losing ground to other European countries in terms of relations with Beijing, and it is likely that British minister will pull out all the stops to impress the Chinese. The ambassador said the improvement in relations was down to the fact that “political mutual trust has been very much enhanced”. Apart from human rights, the state visit may be overshadowed by sharp slowdown in Chinese growth – something that is likely have a major impact on the global economy and especially on the UK as the largest European investor in China and the largest destination in Europe for China’s outward investment. Xi will spend four nights in Britain next week, staying at Buckingham Palace, giving a speech at Westminster, visiting the City of London UK-China business summit and flying to Manchester with Osborne to visit the National Graphene Institute as well as Manchester City football club. Xi is expected to use a speech at Guildhall next Wednesday to set out how he hopes to make London the global centre for offshore Chinese finance. Osborne has staked some of his political capital on the future of UK-China relations. The last state visit from China was by President Hu Jintao in 2005. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh paid a state visit to China in 1986. “This is a major, historic opportunity for China-UK relations,” Liu said. There will be a rush to agree a number of Chinese inward investment deals, notably involving infrastructure, energy, banking and other financial services. British investors especially in the construction sector are hoping for contracts as China’s urban population continues to grow. The urban population has roughly quadrupled in the last 35 years to more than 700 million and is projected to rise by a further 240 million over the next 35 years. It has been argued that previous urbanisation and economic growth have been based on cheap labour, cheap land, robust export demand and little regard for the social and environmental consequences. Asked whether this era might be interrupted if Britain opted to leave the E U, Liu said he hoped not, but added: “We would like to see a strong Europe and a strong UK. I do hope the UK and Europe can work out an arrangement that suits both sides.” In advance of the visit, the Great Britain China Centre announced the appointment of Peter Mandelson as its president, in succession to Geoffrey Howe who retired in July. Lord Mandelson said in a statement: “Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives next week for a state visit to the UK which will mark a new high in UK-China relations. In Britain there is a broad cross-party consensus on the importance of expanding and deepening relations with China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2016/mar/01/guardian-weekly-letters-walmart-ireland-detroit","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-01T12:02:46Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly letters, 4 March 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/mar/01/guardian-weekly-letters-walmart-ireland-detroit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2016/mar/01/guardian-weekly-letters-walmart-ireland-detroit","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly letters, 4 March 2016","bodyText":"Reimagining communities I read with interest the article Towns fear life after Walmart (12 February). I have seen towns in North America where the centres were hollowed out after big stores set up on their edges. That process was demoralising for small businesses and, in the long-term, for communities. The resulting jobs were very low paid, without skill, and often short-term. Once the transition was made, people thought it would last. But Walmart acts only in its own corporate interest. In the meantime a lot of talent has been wasted. The local food and local goods movement emerged to counteract the big box stores and has been successful especially at creating food markets. But small companies producing high quality local goods are scarce, and can only succeed if they have a new kind of business plan and the support of their communities. In less wealthy countries, many people still eke out a living making things and growing food so the marketplace seems vibrant even if the economy is poor. But in North America people have become passive, working for large companies of all kinds, and there is a lack of growth from the bottom up in local communities. Some places latch on to something that works and brings in tourists, but others just go downhill. It is sad but there has to be a public will to remake communities. Time will tell what happens to towns after Walmart leaves, but people need to think differently about the future. In environmentally challenging times, hi-tech gizmos will not be enough. L MacDowell Toronto, Ontario, Canada Poverty and population As an irreligious medical student in 1951 I chose the fecund city of Dublin and its appropriately named Rotunda hospital to undertake a month’s internship in obstetrics (Ireland on brink of change as church power wanes, 26 February). My first patient presented with her 14th pregnancy, and my attempt to time it by asking the date of her last period met with the reply: “Sure, in 1936 I think.” Most babies were then delivered at home, when the links between religion and poverty became apparent. I found some families living in a single room with no running water, yet with religious icons festooning the walls. Later, Mary Robinson, herself a Catholic, became president of Ireland and persuaded politicians to allow the prescribing of contraceptives, perceiving the link between overpopulation and poverty. Pope Francis could make a great contribution to humanity by consenting to widespread distribution of contraceptive technologies. He would gain even greater approval of his flock by allowing priests to marry and opening the priesthood to women. Bryan Furnass Canberra, ACT, Australia An economic SOS I suggest that Owen Jones’ call (19 February) for the left to develop a coherent alternative to current austerity is likely to be realised by people outside the political establishment. Yet those outsiders need to be close enough to the system to be within the earshot of our politicians, whose focus is usually on shorter-term matters. The economics journalist Paul Mason, in his recent book Postcapitalism, seems to have developed such a coherent alternative. I have been a practising economist for 30 years and I am amazed that this book’s comprehensive scope, depth of analysis and way forward has not been taken up in a big way – particularly so when newspapers are calling for such an alternative to be put forward. We need newspapers such as the Guardian Weekly to be the town criers on this issue. Without that how are politicians going to digest it and take the lead before the hard-hearted and the myopic rise to fill the vacuum? This is an SOS. Tony Camenzuli Mardi, NSW, Australia Science of radioactivity As Hiroshima and Nagasaki fade from our memories, the generation culpable going to the grave, Australia’s advance towards nuclear waste (19 February) starts to make financial sense. Not only will they make money simply doing what no one else wants to do, but as the safety regulations creep into line with the science of radioactivity then that work will itself get cheaper. Current regulations emerged from the culture of fear surrounding 1945 and then the cold war. The Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster fuelled public paranoia, but we can’t resist the benefits of nuclear medicine. It reveals the diverse mechanisms with which the human body, indeed all living organisms, handle radiation: either repairing damaged cells or removing them. As soon as the International Committee for Radiological Protection brings regulations in line with knowledge, those Australian contractors will make a huge saving on the day-to-day costs of storage and be laughing all the way to the bank. Where there’s muck, there’s money. Richard Crane Vallon Pont d’Arc, France Detroit’s techno hard times How could Ian Wylie (19 February) talk about the Detroit music scene without mentioning Detroit techno? His revelation about the role of pianos in relation to Motown was fascinating, but wouldn’t it have been interesting to find out about the music that was made in the city when industry – and prosperity – deserted the downtown area? True, the techno scene in Berlin is significant, but with Detroit a simple before and after would have shown how strongly the built environment influences music, from upbeat, commercially viable Motown in boom times to a darker, raw and uncompromising sound with a devoted but minority following in hard times. John Cooper Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Botswana’s uncertain future In the Review article Shine starts to fade on Botswana’s diamond dividend (12 February), the failings that an apparently thriving regional economy has failed to address – from the “mud huts and shacks with few amenities” in which the bushmen now live to the failure of corporate social responsibility, from “the stricken...pipeline to a botched $1.2bn power station contract” – are all the direct result of failed technologies. It’s often difficult to foresee the ill effects of new technologies. But no foresight is required to see that none of the supposed solutions to Botswana’s predicament amount to anything more than business as usual. The technological juggernaut regenerates itself at the expense of planetary ecology and the local populace. More grist to the mill. The tourism industry is, as always, touted as the ideal successor to other failed industries. But which aspects of tourism promote ecological sustainability - increased air traffic, hotel construction, roads and other essential infrastructure? Coal and iron ore are proposed for energy and steel production. Aren’t these what we’re supposed to be leaving in the ground? Might not Botswana take this opportunity to move away from the western myth of industrial development toward a more equitable, sustainable economy that benefits its people without detriment to global ecology? Andrew Hallifax Örebro, Sweden Housing and ownership With regards to the article Under-35s in the UK face becoming permanent renters (19 February), there is a further economic consequence of the UK housing shortage. When the 18-34 year age group eventually die, most will still be renters. In common with the present trend many will be in debt, but will not have significant assets with which to pay it off. Consequently, they will be passing debts on to their children (if they have any), not assets. Who will pick up the bill? The Treasury, ie taxpayers! Malcolm March Dorchester, Dorset, UK • The story on housing affordability in the UK begs the question: why do we need to own a home? As the side-piece by Dan Hancox sagely comments, the future for the young and mobile at least will be living “under someone else’s roof”. Since this seems inevitable, why not cast off the postwar millstone of home ownership as a lifetime goal? It is something that bedevils buyers and investors, as well as policy-makers. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Briefly • We shouldn’t get too upset at developments in computing power and software that enable machines to beat humans at complex games such as chess and Go (12 February). These are games with clearly defined rules that are simplicity itself compared with the real world. Computer modelling too often includes poorly known relationships, and every day we read of its failures to predict outcomes in fields as diverse as climate change and financial markets because we don’t have the knowledge enabling us to model them accurately, not because of insufficient computing power. David Barker Bunbury, Western Australia • Noah Berlatsky’s column (On drama, 19 February) covers the re-emergence of counterfactual fiction and drama, whereby “what if’s” are reimagined as having actually occurred. Such imaginative fables, Berlatsky explains, ‘help us understand the world’ by bringing to life other possible outcomes. This surely is one of the reasons for local interest in Canadian playwright Alix Sobler’s recent play The Secret Annex, which depicts a 25-year-old Anne Frank as having survived the Nazis and living in post-war New York. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada • In Cosmic Classroom (12 February), we were told that Tim Peake is “the first official British astronaut to carry out a space walk”. Are we to infer that there are a few unofficial Brits wandering around up there?

Even liberals","bodyText":"There’s been plenty of evidence, in recent days, to support the popular liberal notion that conservatives have a uniquely weird relationship to the truth. Take the allegations that Bill O’Reilly lied about seeing combat in the Falkland Islands: lying is hardly an exclusively right-wing trait, of course, but there’s something brazen in the Fox host’s decision to fight back by simply asserting that he never claimed he was there – even though he did so, and in print. Then there’s the case of the climate researcher Willie Soon, whose doubt-mongering work turns out to have been funded by huge cash infusions from the fossil-fuel industry, a fact he didn’t bother making clear in most of his publications. Oh, and let’s not forget Rudy Giuliani’s boast that he was raised a better American than Barack Obama – despite the fact that Giuliani’s father, in the resonant words of investigative reporter Wayne Barrett, “did time in Sing Sing for holding up a Harlem milkman and was the bat-wielding enforcer for the loan-sharking operation run out of a Brooklyn bar owned by Rudy’s uncle.” Little wonder that, before this week was a day old, Salon had published two pieces exploring the eccentricity of “right-wing brains” and the mysteries of the conservative mind. Yet a new study by researchers at the Ohio State University ought to stop us liberals from getting overly smug. Focusing specifically on science as reported in the media, it concludes that liberals and conservatives alike are capable of subconsciously rejecting findings that don’t fit their preconceived views. In one sense, this is unsurprising: we’re all subject to biases – excusing, say, bad behavior by a member of the party we support more readily than when it’s those terrible people on the other side of the aisle, up to their usual tricks. Still, science is supposed to be a way of getting at the facts beyond those biases, and liberals tend to pride themselves on being open to its results. So it’s a little unsettling to encounter evidence that nobody’s immune from resisting findings they wish weren’t true. Erik Nisbet, Kathryn Cooper and Kelly Garrett recruited more than 1,500 people to, purportedly, test out a new educational science website. First, they asked respondents to agree or disagree with various claims – for example, that there’s widespread disagreement among scientists about humanity’s role in climate change (there isn’t); or that people living near nuclear power stations are exposed to 20% more radiation than the rest of us (they aren’t). Then participants explored the site, which included the right answers to those questions. When people encountered “dissonant messages” – findings that challenged their views – they were more likely to rate the site negatively, to resist the implications of the information they read there and to express distrust of the scientific community in general. That happened whether they were right-wingers encountering facts about evolution and climate change, or left-wingers encountering facts about fracking and nuclear power. There was one significant difference to make liberals feel better: the negative reaction to dissonant findings was four times greater among conservatives. Yet, as the researchers point out, this might just be because climate change has a higher media profile than nuclear power, and that conservative think-tanks spend millions providing denialists with off-the-rack arguments they can reach for when they wish to avoid the truth – not because one side of the political spectrum is inherently more prone to the bias than the other. (The anti-vaccine movement reinforces the point: it seems to be a largely left-wing phenomenon.) Here’s one disastrously wrongheaded conclusion you could draw from this kind of work: that nobody knows anything, both sides are as bad as each other, and that the scientific consensus on climate change is probably just the result of a bunch of corrupt and biased liberal scientists intent on seeing only the facts they prefer. (If those are the lessons you draw from this study, perhaps you’re just exhibiting the phenomenon itself, and seeing what you want to see in the research?) There’s nothing in the study to support that, nor anything that favors the “on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand” style of false balance in journalism. Instead, this is more evidence for how central a role emotions and subconscious motives play in our thinking processes – a phenomenon known as “motivated reasoning”. It’s tempting to think of psychological biases as relatively minor irritants that distort our otherwise reliable efforts to get at the truth. But what if our reasoning is shot through, from start to finish, with emotional considerations, such as the desire to feel a sense of group belonging, or an unwillingness to admit your previous judgments were flawed? (Or just a strong desire to pander to your chosen constituency for money?) As neuroscience has shown us, emotional judgments get made instantaneously; by the time reasoning cranks into action, it’s doing so in a pre-existing emotional soup. We may be, as Jonathan Haidt puts it, more like lawyers than scientists, concerned above all not with finding the truth but with shoring up our case. No wonder we respond to science that threatens our case not by changing our beliefs but doubting the science. The scholars Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier, among others, even argue that this might be why we’ve evolved to be reasoning creatures in the first place: not to get at facts, but because it’s evolutionarily adaptive to be able to win others to your cause. These are troubling reflections. What if your most deeply held principles aren’t deeply held because they’re right, but because you’re really good at convincing yourself? But the most troubling aspect of the new study may be the following finding: encountering those “conservative-dissonant” facts about the truth of climate change and evolution, it turned out, led to a greater distrust of science across the board, among liberal as well as conservative participants. It seems, in other words, as if the very fact that climate change has become politicized makes everyone trust science a little less. There is no such thing as “just the facts”: every fact you encounter arrives in a mind that’s already full of emotional baggage. When it comes to sculpting reality to fit our preferences, few of us may rise to the level of a Fox News host – but all of us may be a little O’Reillyish inside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/caroline-lucas-michael-morpurgo-conversation-hero-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-26T08:00:26Z","webTitle":"Caroline Lucas meets Michael Morpurgo: ‘You were our hero’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/caroline-lucas-michael-morpurgo-conversation-hero-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/26/caroline-lucas-michael-morpurgo-conversation-hero-planet","fields":{"headline":"Caroline Lucas meets Michael Morpurgo: ‘You were our hero’","bodyText":"Caroline Lucas, joint leader of the Green party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, was working on a Renaissance literature PhD when she decided that politics, not poetry, was the life for her. Michael Morpurgo had a job as a primary schoolteacher when he realised that storytelling was where his talents lay. Now 73, he is one of the biggest names in children’s literature, a former children’s laureate and the author of more than 100 works, the most famous of which is War Horse, adapted by the National Theatre into a smash-hit play and later an Oscar-nominated film directed by Steven Spielberg. The pair meet in Lucas’s cosy parliamentary office in the House of Commons, on a day when Morpurgo has come up to London from his Devon home to visit his old primary school. Lucas used to read Morpurgo’s books to her children, while Morpurgo is a supporter of environmental causes, and with his wife set up the charity Farms For City Children. They begin by reminiscing over cups of tea about their only previous meeting, at a literary festival in Sussex, where they appeared on stage together. Caroline Lucas The marquee wasn’t very waterproof, and you sang. The event was about war and your voice is still going round in my head. Michael Morpurgo I won’t sing now: don’t look at me like that. CL But it was so moving. It was that song from War Horse, Only Remembered. That tune often goes round in my head, actually. MM I rarely talk to politicians, you know; sometimes I have found it fruitless. I think one of the problems we’re living with now is that a lot of people can’t engage with politics. I write stories and try to get my ideas across in that way. CL Have you written any stories about politicians? MM No, but I’m often dealing with the same issues, whether it’s migrants or war. I’ve been on that Jonathan Dimbleby radio programme [Any Questions], but you get so disillusioned. There was a perfectly nice guy on the panel – I think it was his first time – and he had a pile of notes that were clearly full of instructions about what he could say. And he was struggling, because the questions from the audience are never what you expect. I liked him, but he was put in this position where he could not say what he felt, and I thought: what is the point? You haven’t come to do a party political broadcast. Of course, on these things I’m always the odd one out – the writer, the outsider – but you can’t have a conversation with people who don’t mean what they say. I want to tell you a story about the Guardian. Years ago, someone wrote a horrible review of a book of mine, and [adopts a stage whisper] I’ve never forgiven them. It was the book after War Horse, and someone wrote a review that was so hurtful and quite unexpected. CL That wasn’t Private Peaceful? MM No, it was called Twist Of Gold and it was a story about migration from Ireland to America during the potato famine. I love that book, and much more since it was attacked. It’s like attacking one of your children, and you’re like, “Keep off, that’s my baby.” Anyway, I’m not bitter. CL I last saw you before I was elected co-leader of the party. You were talking about politics, and I just want to say that what we are doing [job-sharing] feels so positive. It’s about modelling a different kind of politics, which people often talk about, but we wanted to demonstrate that you could actually do it. MM It lets you live a life, I expect. And many of your constituents will be job-sharing or doing the juggling that people do now. CL I do think this place [the House of Commons] would be improved by having a few more people in it who are more grounded in the reality of everyday life. MM If we’ve learned anything in the past few months, and I’m not sure we have, it’s that the separation between political structures and ordinary people is widening. We’ve got this huge gulf now between those in control and those being controlled. That was what the Brexit vote was about. There is this resentment. CL I agree, and I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to make a link to our electoral system, because first-past-the-post enables MPs to ignore a huge number of their constituents, all the time. If you’re in a safe seat, you don’t need to care what they think because, barring a revolution, the same party gets back in time and time again. What was interesting about the EU referendum was that people were so surprised their votes had made a difference. MM They counted. CL Yes, and now it’s our responsibility to try to understand what was behind that result. MM The referendum should never have happened. It was political manoeuvring on the part of the Tories to sort out their own problems. CL It feels to me like a betrayal of young people who, by and large, voted to stay in Europe. I was very involved with a group who were using social media to try to get some different messages out there, about how extraordinary the European Union is. MM The problem is, everyone takes peace so much for granted now, but that was the idea, originally. Yes, it’s turned into something else, and that something else has become a bit of a monster, but instead of staying and working things through, we’re going to do this thing called sovereignty. I mean, what world are people living in? CL The English, in particular, are still struggling with a sense of identity after colonialism. We used to have a much clearer place in the world. I think trying to create a progressive patriotism has never been more important. You won’t remember this, I’m sure, because my two boys are now 20 and 23, but when they were younger, they absolutely loved your books. We read them all the time. When my elder son Theo had to do a project that entailed writing about a book, he decided to write to you. And you sent a reply that was so beautiful, and Theo thought it was so amazing that this great author had written to him, that he said, “I’m going to write to him again.” I tried to persuade him not to, not to push it, but he did – and he got a second letter back! So you were a hero for many years in our household. MM Well, I voted Green for the first time last year, largely because of you. CL Good. MM I noticed your rise – it was a quiet rise, and I like quietness. And I like people who argue with reason, and a degree of empathy and understanding of what the other side is saying. I think you never say a word you don’t mean, and there aren’t many politicians like that. CL Thank you! MM I moved out of London when I was little. My parents moved us to the coast of Essex, near a place called Bradwell, which is about to become another nuclear power station, and I had my first, wonderful experiences of nature there. The sea wall went past a chapel, and there were lovely fields where the hares would play, and sea birds, and the great soupy brown North Sea rolling in. The first environmental issue I ever confronted was the plan for an atomic power station to be built there in the 1950s. Of course, the village was divided: my family’s side of the argument was that it would devastate the local area, but we lost, so my parents moved us away. It was like an Agatha Christie village: there was a squire and a policeman. They didn’t kill each other, but it was one of those essentially English places. That was where I first confronted the question of how we look after the environment, and the first time I saw adults get cross with each other. CL My political journey started with the anti-nuclear campaign. Greenham Common was really important to me, and Jonathon Porritt’s book Seeing Green was a real lightbulb moment – one of those books that change your life. It’s up to each person to decide how they can make a difference. I was living in a bedsit in Clapham at the time, and I noticed the Green party was based on Clapham High Road. So I took this as a sign and marched off and signed up there and then. I think it’s so crucial what you’re doing with Farms For City Children, because people won’t protect what they don’t love, and they won’t love what they don’t know. That sense of getting the earth under your fingernails is crucial – it worries me so much that young people are growing up without that access to nature. I was at a conference recently, and one speaker was saying that, in one children’s dictionary, the words conker and bluebell had gone and been replaced by chatroom and blog, and that really crystallised something for me. MM We’ve got a large, adult, urban population who have never dug up potatoes or seen the worms wriggling. The writer I grew up with, more than anyone else, was Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote about landscape wonderfully well. But the book that is most important to me on this subject is by a Frenchman called Jean Giono. It’s a very short novella called The Man Who Planted Trees, about an old shepherd living in the hills of Provence. A visitor comes along, a student travelling around, and the old man says, “Do you want to come with me while I do the sheep?” And off they go. The old man takes a sack of acorns, he doesn’t say anything – there’s hardly any dialogue in this book – and he wanders off with the sheep and starts planting acorns. The student goes away, the first world war comes along, and when he comes back from the war, he decides to go and see the shepherd. Ten years later, the shepherd is still there, and all over the hillside are these green shoots: it’s a glorious story. CL Donald Trump’s election is terrifying from an environment perspective. If the US really were to withdraw from the Paris agreement... I mean, the irony of that, when it’s just been ratified! It would be enormously damaging. Having said that, I do think there’s enough momentum now. Countries including China are moving in a more environmentally sound direction, because they recognise that is where their best interests lie. Places like California are really roaring ahead in terms of renewable energy. It’s important to try to be hopeful, even at times like this. MM I have a strange hope that Trump fulfils the promise of most politicians, by not keeping his promises. The problem is, he could do a lot of nasty things and millions of people would like him to, because it’s cocking a snook at liberals. CL But some people must have voted for Trump in spite of, not because of, his racism, misogyny and climate denial – because they’re just so angry with what they see as the corruption of politics, when they see a minority of people who are doing so, so well. And we have to learn from that. MM Because it’s our anger, too. We may not have risen to the dizzy heights of American heavy industry in the 20th century, when they were supreme. But here, too, the last coalmines have closed, and we treated people appallingly. Our job now is to educate young people, because we need them to grow up with knowledge and understanding. We’ve talked about how books have affected our lives, and sometimes they really do help point the way. We’ve demeaned our democracy, this extraordinary gift that generations fought for, and that’s what we’re handing on to our children. That’s our great crime. I went to my old primary school this morning. I last walked into it more than 60 years ago. Then it was an entirely pink school and I was one of the pink children, and I looked around the hall today – a tiny little place, of course I used to think it was the biggest hall in the world – and I looked around and the entire world was there: every religion, every culture, and I thought, “This is extraordinary, and these amazing teachers are making it work, and this is the kind of world I believe in.” This is the world as it is. CL I agree. MM You’ve written a book, too, haven’t you? CL Yes, I have, Honourable Friends. It’s a weaving together of green politics and my first five years here [in the Commons]. It felt important, watching the weirdness of parliament, to try to capture some of that. The subtitle is Parliament And The Fight For Change, and hopefully it will change, because this place is unfit for any serious purpose. We should take the refurbishment that is coming as an opportunity: let’s have a purpose-built, glass building, so people can see in. Let’s have a hemicycle, rather than a confrontational chamber that just reinforces the whole idea of shouting at one another. MM You have to be brave to be a politician. In my case, things just happened. When I left school, I went into the army, because I was trying to work out which of my uncles I should follow. I had one uncle who was a pacifist and one who wasn’t, and I hadn’t worked out which was the path for me. So I went to Sandhurst [military academy], where I had a strange experience in December 1962. We were in trenches and there was a fake enemy, as you have in army exercises, and they were the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. The people they hated most on this Earth were the English, so they were shouting across the snowy waste of no man’s land the vile things they were going to do, and I got very frightened. I realised this wasn’t for me, so I made a decision, aided by my wife, whom I married aged 19, and went to university and ended up in front of a class of children telling stories. I love what I do. When I read to a bunch of children this morning, I thought, well, it doesn’t get better than this. CL I was older when I met my husband – 29. I’d just started working for Oxfam and I was his lodger. MM You spoke earlier about wanting to make a difference. Of all the things you’ve done, which job has made the biggest difference? CL I seem to feel that, wherever I go, the power is somewhere else, but I think it’s coming full circle now. When I was at Oxfam, I have a very vivid memory of lobbying Glenys Kinnock, who was an MEP and someone I respect hugely for her work on trade policy to help people in poorer countries. I saw her on the other side of the desk and I thought, “I really want to be her, I want to be on that side of the desk.” So I stood for the European parliament, and then, when I got there, it felt as if more of the decisions were being made in national governments. So I did a year’s secondment to the Department for International Development, and thought, that’s still not it – I’ve got to be an MP. Now, I hear other MPs say, “I can’t do that because the public aren’t with me.” You realise that, wherever you are, the power is with the people. Even in this place, MPs won’t move unless the public is pushing them. MM That’s how it should be. CL There’s something, I don’t know what the word is – not pathos, but all your books tread a line between joy and tragedy. Private Peaceful is one of my favourites. I think, for me, it was about taking your kids to a place that is potentially quite bleak, but it’s done in such a safe way. There’s a lot of grief in the books, but children really respond to it. MM Most of them have been there. There’s been someone, a granny or a dog, it doesn’t matter. I think it’s important never to patronise children, or to think they don’t feel as deeply as we do. They’re not as informed, maybe, but they feel what we feel – and particularly, I think, they feel lonely, and books can help. Because if someone is reading to you, there is a profound engagement with that person. Let me ask you: do you ever stand back and think, what is the point? There must be moments. Thinking of the awful thing that happened to your colleague [MP Jo Cox] who was killed not long ago, don’t you think to yourself, “Well, that woman lived to make things better, and look what happened to her”? CL Briefly and occasionally. But what keeps you going is being surrounded by good people. I feel so blessed by the people I have working with me – it’s nearly always the case you can derive strength from that. MM So is that what you think of, when you do occasionally put your head in your hands and sob? CL Yes. But I also think, once you start down the slippery slope towards despair, then really, what is the point? We’ve always got to feel that we can fight. MM That’s what I admire you for. That’s what I couldn’t do, is what I’m saying, really. As a writer, I spend a lot of time alone, which is what you must long for. But sometimes on your own you can think too long and hard about how the world is. Those moments pass. CL I feel privileged to have met so many powerful people – I don’t mean powerful people, I mean ordinary people who have become powerful in their communities. I mean the anti-fracking Nanas in Lancashire, this group of women who have just decided they are not going to have fracking, people who have never taken action in that way before. Now I have to go – I’m supposed to be handing in a letter to the Treasury about local government cuts. MM Can I ask you one more tiny thing? Does the history of this place, the history of people making decisions here, affect you, in the sense that you feel you are part of something that works? CL No, it feels absolutely dysfunctional. [She smiles.] Oh, bless you. Let me give you a quick hug. • This conversation has been condensed as part of the editing process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2014/sep/12/power-plant-construction-programme-expensive-unnecessary-mps-energy-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-11T23:20:00Z","webTitle":"Power plant construction programme 'may prove expensive and unnecessary'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/12/power-plant-construction-programme-expensive-unnecessary-mps-energy-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/sep/12/power-plant-construction-programme-expensive-unnecessary-mps-energy-demand","fields":{"headline":"Power plant construction programme 'may prove expensive and unnecessary'","bodyText":"Britain risks locking itself into an expensive and unnecessary programme of power plant construction under flawed new policies being pursued by the government, a key committee of MPs has warned. Consumers could be forced to underwrite more than £350m of extra spending in the first year alone if ministers do not put more emphasis on reducing power demand rather than building more capacity, according to the energy and climate change committee. In a letter to energy minister Matthew Hancock the committee chairman, Tim Yeo, also accuses the UK's main energy infrastructure provider, National Grid, which is playing a key role in the schemes, of being hopelessly compromised. \"It is impossible for National Grid to give objective advice to government on this issue since the profitability of their regulated United Kingdom business is directly linked to the construction of new transmission capacity,\" he wrote. His committee has been taking evidence in what is called \"electricity demand-side measures\" to review the role being proposed for those who can help reduce the need for power. This is particularly valuable now, when the UK is facing an energy crisis, because old coal and nuclear plants are being retired and new windfarms or gas plants are not being built quickly enough. Yeo told Hancock that demand-side response (DSR) offered a cheap and greener alternative to building new generating capacity. He added that it should play a crucial and growing role in keeping the lights on in coming years. He praised the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (DECC), the regulator Ofgem and the National Grid for progressing initiatives but fears unnecessary obstacles are also being thrown in the way of this new industry. \"Many DSR industry representatives have expressed serious and legitimate concerns,\" Yeo said. Among those worries are that DSR providers can only win contracts for one year while power station builders can get deals that run for 15 years. The £359m annual cost of building new power stations as opposed to reducing demand mentioned by Yeo is taken from a new study, also out on Friday, by NERA Economic Consulting, which is working for DSR companies such as KiWi Power. A DECC spokesman said it was too early to comment on the NERA report but defended the role of National Grid and said the infrastructure provider was doing all it could to understand the concerns of the demand reduction providers. \"We are talking to the DSR industry to better understand the issues they face. We want to make sure the market works efficiently and offers consumers the best possible deal,\" he added. In a statement on Thursday night, National Grid also defended its role, saying it \"does not give advice to government on the level of DSR that should be procured in the capacity market auction. We advise on how much capacity is needed in total, but we are neutral how that capacity is made up – whether it comes from generation or demand side response.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/16/satanic-cyclists-consensus-polarised","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-16T18:34:42Z","webTitle":"It’s not Satanic to say cyclists get a raw deal | Dreda Say Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/16/satanic-cyclists-consensus-polarised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/16/satanic-cyclists-consensus-polarised","fields":{"headline":"It’s not satanic to say cyclists get a raw deal","bodyText":"Though I’ve never learned to drive and never had a bike, I know motorists and cyclists aren’t always best friends. There was the minicab driver who told me that anyone who gets a bike should get an asbo slapped on them. At the same time, many cyclist friends have had at least one near-death experience on the roads. So when my local authority got funding to introduce a “Mini-Holland” scheme, (for cycling – not cannabis cafes or prostitution), I assumed everyone would be happy. Life would be safer for cyclists with frustrated motorists no longer trapped behind them as they pedal up hills. What the response proved was that even when local authorities try something many of us might consider progressive, things aren’t always simple. When I went to view the plans at a local school, the event was unusually well attended and animated. The plans themselves seemed innocent enough, the usual mix of cycle lanes, traffic calming and road closures. Naively, I asked one of the staff what the fuss was about. The guy, with a face like a Blairite at a Labour hustings, said he was getting a hard time from residents and not just from the usual suspect petrolheads. Objectors included disabled drivers and some who rely on vehicles to pick up the elderly and children. Some were worried about emergency access, while others, even the sympathetic, worried about the cost and the time frame. The objectors also included many who suspected that whatever the results of the consultation, the scheme would be pushed through anyway as such things have been in the past. So what about democracy, they said. These people include neighbours I like and respect. This controversy represents on a small scale a more general problem that faces those who support what they consider progress, environmental or otherwise. It’s very difficult to move things forward in society without the interests of innocent parties being hit somewhere down the line. Part of the problem is that politicians and activists are often very reluctant to admit this inevitable consequence. The plans for Mini-Holland included the rather unlikely claim that it would be good for motorists too. To many critics, that Panglossian claim merely added insult to injury. We see this phenomenon in politics all the time: a refusal to accept, acknowledge or understand the consequences for others of decisions or proposals. Many critics of austerity think its advocates cruel, corrupt or stupid. But the more likely explanation is that never having suffered austerity, its advocates simply don’t grasp what it means for the victims, and worse, don’t want to. Nor is this phenomenon confined to the right. I once saw a union rep from Sellafield reminding anti-nuclear campaigners that his members stood to lose good jobs if their campaign were successful. That of course doesn’t invalidate arguments for or against nuclear power, but is a reminder for activists that others might have good reasons for not seeing things their way. At the heart of this problem lies the reluctance of true believers, whatever their belief happens to be, to accept that anyone can oppose them in good faith. It also explains why true believers, whatever their belief, often seem to get on so well. Anyone who’s ever been in an argument with a religious fundamentalist will know they have a simple explanation for your disagreement – you’re possessed by Satan. In the same way, I’ve met environmental campaigners who think that if you raise even mild objections to their ideas, then you’re truly possessed by Satan. Or Big Oil, which amounts to the same thing. I’m no fundamentalist. I think we should take a secular approach to the environment. I don’t cycle myself but I support it, and think the risks cyclists sometimes have to take aren’t acceptable. At the same time, I would expect any objections to schemes that might help them to be taken seriously, acknowledged and addressed. But even when the answer seems clear, the process of change is always messy. We all want progress, but someone always loses something on the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2016/feb/02/weekly-letters-finance-labour-imbalance","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-02T13:52:03Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 5 February 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/02/weekly-letters-finance-labour-imbalance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2016/feb/02/weekly-letters-finance-labour-imbalance","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 5 February 2016","bodyText":"New economic model needed Will Hutton is correct: crashing markets are telling us something and we do need “a wholesale change in economic thinking” (22 January). We must redress the imbalance between world finance and labour markets, but trade union resistance and top-down regulation are not enough. To say “great companies need to be allowed to purpose themselves around creating value rather than dancing to the interests of disengaged shareholders” sounds like whistling in the wind. What if shareholders are not disengaged at all but in the driving seat? Aren’t many company CEOs themselves shareholders, rewarded in share options, empowered to buy back shares for their companies with more interest in quick profits than social value? Here in south Wales, the future of former British Steel hangs in the balance while its Indian owners Tata axe jobs wholesale. Up the Severn at Hinkley Point, the future of nuclear power is entrusted by a privatising UK government to state enterprise in France and China. With such a precarious and top-heavy economy, we could do worse than begin rebuilding from the ground, applying common sense and social democracy to the direction of the corporate industries and services that shape our lives. The words “company”, “shares” and “ownership” have been hijacked by bosses and wealthy backers. Time now to reclaim them, in law and common usage, to ensure that commonwealth means what it says. Greg Wilkinson Swansea, UK • Will Hutton does a fine job of explaining the problems facing capitalism in the near term. However, neither he, nor anyone else I’ve run across, has analysed the long-term problems facing capitalism. Capitalism is an economic ideology based on the premise of unending growth. But infinite growth in a finite system is a logical impossibility. It is past time for the capitalist ideologues to recognise this and to develop a sustainable ideology. Molly M Radke Poulsbo, Washington, US • Yes, “It’s clear what needs to happen”: we probably all agree. But what we need to know is how? Sally Litherland Salisbury, UK Hope for a resurgent left Ewen MacAskill’s report Revealed: how Jeremy Corbyn is reviving the Labour party (22 January) is encouraging. Similarly encouraging is Justin Trudeau’s win in the last Canadian election and Bernie Sanders’s increasing popularity over Hillary Clinton in opinion polls. These three factors give grounds to hope that rightwing extremism in the west is on the wane. The rise in popularity of both Corbyn and Sanders expresses the hope of British and American voters – indeed, the world – for a peaceful future, regardless of what the rightwing diehards say about them. The west desperately needs some strong leaders who have the courage of their convictions. Bill Mathew Melbourne, Australia European nuclear deterrent According to Matthew d’Ancona in Big issues are getting a low billing (22 January) the major twin problems facing Britain’s Tory and Labour parties are Trident and the EU. Since both are interconnected, both could be solved at once by the party that had the vision to recognise that Britain’s long-term security interests are best served by retaining its membership in an EU that develops a common nuclear deterrent. Britain could play a major role in the development of such a European deterrent along with other EU members. Taxpayers in all EU states, including Britain, would all stand to benefit as the costs would need to be shared by all member states. This alone represents a major reason why Britain should remain in the EU. Christopher Ryecart Kefermarkt, Austria Sugar tax makes sense The NHS chief proposes to introduce a sugar tax on hospital snacks, there being a pandemic of the so-called metabolic syndrome of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in parallel with the postwar threefold rise of sugar consumption, rising hospital costs and childhood obesity (22 January). It would seem sensible to impose a tax nationally on sugary foods, fizzy drinks and confectionery. No doubt any proposed sugar tax will raise fierce objections from the sugar industry, similar to those raised by tobacco companies to restriction of cigarette advertising, and from the reduction of subsidies to fossil-fuel corporations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The ethical question arises as to whether short-term company profits should take precedence over long-term gains in public health. Bryan Furnass Canberra, ACT, Australia Perils of a life spent online In her opinion column (22 January), Gaby Hinsliff considers how celebrities can afford to resist compulsive email checking because they are always in demand. There is a broader and more damaging issue for a society increasingly preoccupied with expected or wanted email and social media communications. In the absence of hoped-for messages and information, the degree of anxiety experienced is only limited by the imagination of the recipient. It is a feature of people’s obsession with virtual online life that we are increasingly detached from the true essentials that give meaning and balance to our existence. Our vulnerability in succumbing to this dependence represents a real threat to society and we should resist the expectations thrust upon us by those pedalling virtual online life. Giles Waley Stirling, UK The dangers of hydropower Hydro dams and artificial trees (15 January) demonstrate an alarming failure to understand the natural world. Hydroelectricity is not clean; it is just a different form of dirt. Damage to fisheries is the thin end of the wedge; the real damage goes right through river systems as natural flooding is prevented and wetlands are destroyed, killing everything from birds and plants to micro-organisms. Poles and wires cut a swathe of erosion through fragile landscapes. As for artificial trees: a tree is part of an incredibly complex eco-system. Real trees are a conduit for cycling nutrients from deep beneath the earth, and through the release of evaporation they influence the atmosphere and may trigger rain. Where the soil is too shallow for trees, try grass, which has a terrific ability to sequester carbon, and the advantage of needing to be eaten. For the human race to survive, we need to abandon our recent obsessions with electricity and internal combustion, and realise we are part of the natural world. When we destroy it, we destroy ourselves. Philippa Morris Gravesend, NSW, Australia Ultrasound and stethoscope Your otherwise excellent article (15 January) on the future of the stethoscope implies the wrong question: is ultrasound or the stethoscope best? In fact both are very useful in competent hands; the real question is when to apply them. For example, 50% of preschool children have heart murmurs but only 1% are abnormal, which should be determined by listening alone. In the case of adults presenting with a heart attack or with heart failure, imaging the heart is of critical importance. Better teaching and skills with the stethoscope are long overdue. John Finley Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada Briefly • The article about apartheid nostalgia and the taboo for non-white South Africans to use the beaches in that era (15 January) reminds me of a story related by a black Canadian colleague of South African birth. He took his family back to the home country during those days. One of his most difficult tasks was to restrain the children from running across the beach into the water when he stopped the rental car at a seaside site. Even harder was to explain the rationale and to convince them that they truly could not use the beach. Anthony Walter Surrey, British Columbia, Canada • François Bostnavaron’s article Tourism set to take off in St Helena (15 January) leaves me somewhat uncertain as to where Napoleon’s remains really are. St Helena? Les Invalides in Paris? Are just a few strands of his arsenic-tainted hair buried on the island, or just his heart in Paris? If he is truly buried on St Helena, why did I think I was viewing his coffin at Les Invalides in Paris?

Hunt, one of the moderates in the group of former shadow cabinet members that declined to join Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench, also rejected claims in David Cameron’s Tory conference speech that the Tories were now the voice of the centre ground and social reform. “This week we have watched, with our face pressed against the glass, not only a Tory victory parade at their conference in Manchester, but also the sight of them manoeuvring for succession and laying the foundations for their next election campaign too,” the former shadow education secretary will say at the University of Sheffield on Friday. Highlighting the attacks on tax credits, trade union rights and Sure Start centres, he will warn: “Our country cannot afford to have Labour left on the street outside, protesting about the decisions of the powerful within.” Hunt will say Corbyn’s leadership represents an opportunity for Labour due to the new energy, growing membership and intellectual renewal, but also a threat if the party is lured into a position of “perennial demonstration and the thrill of being the relentless outsider”. Labour has a duty to form a government, he will say, but it will only be trusted to do so if the party listens to the “real and not the imagined concerns of people’s lives”. He will argue that since 2010, the party has distanced itself from voters concerns. “Labour has marched decisively away from the views of voters on issues that are fundamental to our electoral prospects: immigration, personal financial interest, welfare, public services, and business.” Warning against “algorithm politics” where activists gravitate only to views that confirm their own, he will say: “If social media were politicising the many as well as radicalising the few; were it significantly growing the number of people engaged in politics in the first place, rather than confirming pre-held bias, then Ed Miliband might now be sitting in 10 Downing Street.” “What people say to each other on the internet – and social media in particular – rewards strong, polarising opinions and primary coloured politics. “Far from broadening the mind through access to the greatest library human beings have ever created, people’s experience of the internet is increasingly a narrow online world where anyone who puts their heads above the parapet can be the target of an anonymised digital mob.” Hunt, one of the defeated party modernisers attempting to map out a new agenda, will call for a contributory welfare system, an affirmation of the English left identity and new thinking on what forms of corporate governance finance and ownership might suit the digital age. “When the British chancellor flies to Beijing to offer government securities to Chinese investors to support the French state in building a UK nuclear power station, our economic model is bust,” he will say. “On housing, asset inflation, pension and mortgage policies for the self-employed, land tax rates and even basic income guarantees, there are so many radical options to explore.” Hunt will likely cause anger among more leftwing MPs by sticking to his belief that the party cannot just defend the status quo on welfare, saying in the run-up to the election that Labour “gave the impression we were against every and any new idea on welfare. We offended the British people’s sense of fairness by appearing to oppose the benefits cap – but we didn’t have any new ideas. “More important than ever in an age of mass migration, as a sense of unfairness about welfare contributes to resentment towards new arrivals, the rule should be: You pay more in. You get more out. “If you have a strong record of work, you should receive more help and protection for your home when you fall on hard times. Because right across the world countries with an entitlement based system such as ours are gripped by diminishing social support for the welfare state.” He urges the party to embrace city region devolution, saying he finds it infuriating that a form of government first championed by Labour had been stolen by chancellor George Osborne as the centre piece of his conference speech. He will urge the party not to retreat back to statism, saying: “We must shelve our timidity, match Osborne’s offer and go beyond it by giving city and country regions the power to vary local taxes, including business rates from a baseline which takes account of regional disparities of wealth.” He will also press the party to support the family saying it is “the most powerful institution for early child and, as such, long-term wellbeing and achievement”. Although he criticises the abolition of the old income based child poverty target, he argues the party “needs to go beyond a belief that child poverty can be solved largely or even entirely through material redistribution”. “We need institutions that tackle inequality at source – by raising parents’ opportunities to work, children’s opportunities to learn and families’ opportunities to plan their time together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/sep/16/north-korea-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-16T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"How to stop worrying and embrace a nuclear North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/north-korea-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/sep/16/north-korea-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"How to stop worrying and embrace a nuclear North Korea","bodyText":"North Korea’s announcement that it has restarted its atomic bomb fuel production has sparked a now-familiar chorus of outrage and concern around the world. It seems that the west, governments and civilians alike, is more concerned with a possible military threat than with the myriad human rights violations taking place inside the country. North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn’t spill over the border, here’s what the west should do about North Korea: 1. Stop worrying about a nuclear North The DPRK isn’t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise. It’s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. 2. Continue joint military exercises with South Korea The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea – and offer all stick but no carrot. 3. Engage in state-level diplomacy Here’s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK’s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments – not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians’ basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial. 4. Recognise the limits of unofficial diplomacy The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. 5. Listen to defectors (critically) Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North’s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. 6. Read North Korean propaganda The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK’s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many “North Korea watchers” read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults – but these readers fail to realise that they aren’t the KCNA’s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it’s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. 7. Support efforts by (some) human rights groups International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not.

In a recent interview with Margaret Thatcher’s biographer, Charles Moore, for the Policy Institute at King’s College, London, the man who ran Thatcher’s press office for 11 years, my old friend Sir Bernard Ingham, said about Thatcherism: “I’m sorry, desperately sorry, that so many people had to suffer the consequences.” Now, it is true that this admission was made in the context of Ingham’s claim that those years he worked for her “produced very substantial improvement in the country” – a debatable point – but it is interesting that he made the apology. He also had the good grace to add: “I wish some privatisation had been carried out better [sic].” I’ll say! Now, if there was one economic concept that successive Thatcher administrations were proud of it was privatisation. Rather more so than of monetarism. It was Peter Jay who once joked that instructing Thatcher about monetarism was like showing Genghis Khan a map of the world. But it was privatisation that those Thatcher governments fumbled their way into exporting to the rest of the world. It is therefore a remarkable turn of events that we now have a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, a veritable son of Thatcher, who has recently gone kowtowing to a communist Chinese government, pleading with them to provide finance for the construction in Britain of a nuclear power station by a French nationalised industry. I am not making this up. Quite apart from the controversy stirred up over Osborne’s cloying approach to a regime notorious for its abuse of human rights; quite apart from the fact that experts with far greater knowledge of the energy industry than most of us have raised serious doubts about the financial basis of the project, Osborne’s cavalier attitude lands him on weak ground when it comes to opposing Jeremy Corbyn’s approach to the railways. Osborne, unlike many Chinese, has been democratically elected and has every human right to believe what he likes. But it was good to hear Labour’s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pick up this point in his speech to the Labour conference in Brighton last week. Because there were so many other interesting aspects of McDonnell’s speech, the following passage did not receive wide coverage. It is therefore worth repeating: “I found the Conservatives’ rant against Jeremy’s proposal to bring rail back into public ownership ironic when George Osborne was touring China selling off to the Chinese state bank any British asset he could lay his hands on.” It was a Conservative MP and railway enthusiast Robert Adley who observed that rail privatisation would be “the poll tax on wheels”, and so it proved to be. Moreover, not many people realise that the “privatised” system has actually had to be partly renationalised and is costing the taxpayer £4bn a year in subsidies. George Osborne is what is known in the trade as a “chancer”. Chancers often get found out. William Hill has made the chancellor hot favourite to succeed David Cameron. We shall see. The wider implications of his unnecessary policy of austerity are gradually being brought home to the middle classes and all those middle-England voters whom the new leaders of the Labour party are accused of ignoring. The “cuts” are affecting surgeons, GP surgeries, local authority social services for the old and the infirm, and reaching into many other corners of everyday life. McDonnell is right to oppose the policy of austerity for austerity’s sake. His predecessor, Ed Balls, recently said to me that this must be the first shadow chancellor who is to the left of your correspondent. I wonder. McDonnell has emphasised that he would “not tackle the deficit on the backs of middle- and low-earners, and especially by attacking the poorest in our society”, but as an acquaintance observed when I said I thought McDonnell’s conference speech was a breath of fresh air: “But he still goes on about the deficit, and you told me the deficit was not the problem!” Quite right. It was not the problem. It was the solution. The deficit was the consequence of the banking crisis, not of Brown’s policies. When the banking crisis led to the collapse of demand in the economy in 2008-2009, the deficit was necessary to prevent the fall from becoming even steeper. There are those who say that recent revisions to the statistics mean that the crisis was not as bad as some made out. To them I offer the words last week of Joe Grice, the chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, who commented that it “remains the sharpest downturn and slowest recovery on record”. When recoveries are slow, deficits come down slowly. I suspect that McDonnell feels that, because there is such widespread misunderstanding of this, he has to pay heed to popular opinion and sound more “orthodox” than he really believes is necessary. But at least he is putting the emphasis on attacking what “austerity” actually means in practice. Whether or not the Corbyn team wins the confidence of the electorate it promises to be a very strong opposition on the economic front."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T20:06:06Z","webTitle":"Macron tells May City will get less access to Europe than now if UK leaves single market - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Macron tells May City will get less access to Europe than now if UK leaves single market - Politics live","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said that if the UK leaves the single market, British firms, including from the City, will get less access to Europe than they have now. (See 7.21pm.) At a press conference at the end of what otherwise seemed a cordial summit at Sandhurst with Theresa May, he said the UK would have to choose between having a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit or Canadian-style one. In response, May said she accepted that “as we leave the EU we will no longer be full members of the single market”. But she said it was in the interests of both sides to get a deal covering goods and services. She went on: I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it’s actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system. May and Macron, accompanied by a cohort of senior British and French ministers, struck a series of agreements relating to Anglo-French cooperation after the summit. They released 13 papers and agreements in total, covering areas like security and defence, cyber and digital, foreign policy and even sports events. Afterwards, in a reference to his announcement about letting the Bayeux Tapestry visit the UK in 2022, Macron said the two countries were “making a new tapestry together”. Macron said that as a result of what he described as the Sandhurst treaty affecting border controls at Calais the processing of migrants coming to the UK would be speeded up. (See 6.33pm.) May, who has been criticised by the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage for the deal, was less keen to talk about this aspect of the summit and did not use the phrase “Sandhurst treaty”. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments Here is some comment from journalists on the press conference. From Politico Europe’s Charlie Cooper From Sky’s Faisal Islam From Politico Europe’s Tom McTague From Newsnight’s Mark Urban From the Times’ Sam Coates From Reaction’s Iain Martin Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has described Theresa May’s Calais deal as “capitulation”. This is what Emmanuel Macron said when asked why he was opposed to including financial services in a future trade deal. Please allow me to be very clear. I’m here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much at the heart of the European Union. So the choice is on the British side, not on my side. They can have no differentiated access to financial services. If you want access to the single market, including the financial services, be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction. Such are the rules and we know this is the system already in place for Norway. If you want a trade access, it will cover everything, but then it is not full access to the single market and to financial services. Otherwise it’s closer to the situation of Canada. We have some trade agreements which allow access to all services, be they financial or others, access as well to any industry sector, but not the same level of relationship as if you were a member of the single market. And there shall be no hypocrisy in this respect, otherwise it will not work. Or we would destroy the single market and its coherence. So, its’s simple. I would not want to exclude any sector in the trade agreement to come. The negotiations will be led by Michel Barnier. But it does not mean that the access it will allow will be equivalent to [being] a member of the single market. Otherwise you can choose between Norway, or being the equivalent of a current member of the European Union. There is nothing new or surprising about his comments. Ever since Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 EU leaders, more or less unanimously, have been saying that the UK will not be able to maintain all the benefits of single market membership when it leaves without accepting the concomitant obligations. In Brussels that prospect is usually described as “cherry picking”, while in the UK it is (Boris Johnson-style) having one’s cake and eating it. Whatever, Macon is saying it won’t be allowed. But even though EU leaders have repeatedly made comments like this, Theresa May and her colleagues continue to insist (as May did this evening - see 6.54pm) that some form of cherry picking or cake having-and-eating will be permitted. That’s why the Macron words are news; it is the reality drum beat (or the bluff drum beat, if you think the EU are bluffing) getting louder and louder as the Brexit deadline looms. May says the summit today has been about developing the partnership between the two countries. It was also about developing interests for their economic future. That is good for the people of France and the people of the UK, she says. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary shortly. The press conference is still going on. There is a live feed here. But it does not include translation, Macron is speaking, and my French is not up to it. Q: Why do you not want to include financial services in a future trade deal? Do you want to punish Britain? Or do you want to take the jobs? Or do you think the UK is trying to have its cake and eat it? Marcon says he is not here to punish or reward. He wants to ensure teh single market is preserved. The choice is on the UK side. If they want access to the single market, “be my guest”. But you will need to contribute and obey the rules. If you want trade access, that is not full access to the single market. It is closer to what Canada has. It won’t have the same level of access. There can be no “hypocrisy” in this, he says. He says Michel Barnier will led the talks. But if the UK is outside the single market, it won’t get the same access to financial markets. Macron says City will not get same access to EU markets it has not if UK leaves single market. Q: Michel Barnier says financial services will not be included in a deal. What will you do to change the EU’s mind? May says she wants the UK to have a special trade relationship with the EU, covering goods and services. She will be looking for a deep and special partnership. She also wants a good relationship on security, she says. Q: How many unaccompanied minors will the UK accept? Why did you agree to do this deal? May says no one wants more migrants at Calais. They want to reduce the numbers. She say the UK has consistently accepted unaccompanied minors. What they have agreed today is a way of making that process as smooth as possible. Q: You said you would stop migrants at Calais. Why did you change your mind? Macron says the Le Touquet agreement does not have anything to do with Brexit. He never said it should be torn apart. There is a joint border. That has to be managed, he says. Without that, there would be a humanitarian border. He says in the spring of 2016 he said the situation could not last and that there would have to be change at Calais. Now the “jungle” has gone, he says. But he says this topic is not over. He has taken some decisions domestically. There were no shelters for people at Calais. They have been set up. They are places where people can be assessed. That said, the situation is still “problematic” at Calais, he says. He says people are being moved to places where they can apply for asylum. He repeats the point about how the time taken to process applications will be speeded up. (See 6.33pm.) Q: The Calais deal looks as if it involves taking more migrants from France. Is that right? May says the Calais deal is about securing the UK border. It is in the UK’s national interest. There is an issue about unaccompanied minors, she says. She wants to make the process as smooth as possible for minors with family in the UK. But she also wants to reduce the number of migrants trying to come through Calais. it is also in the interests of France, she says. May says Calais deal will help to make Britain more secure. Q: After Brexit, are UK prime ministers less powerful? Macron says it is not for him to assess the influence of one PM or another. The UK is a member of the UN security council. That will not be affected by Brexit. He says Britain and France will always work together on issues like the Sahel. Q: Are you offering the tapestry to try to win us back? Macron says fighting did not stop with William the Conqueror. There were wars for centuries after that. He hopes that young people today can look forward to peace. Somehow, we are making a new tapestry together, he says. Macron says this is the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. So many people died, including in his own family. He says the French are very proud of the Bayeux Tapestry. It is a unique piece of art, he says. He says he wants a Europe of culture. The tapestry is “an invitation to be humble”, because of the art it represents. It is very fragile, and has not travelled abroad. But he very much wants it to come to the UK, he says. He favours more exchanges of art. Macron turns to Brexit. He says it was not the main focus of the talks. He respects the decision taken by the UK, although he regrets it. He says the EU has a negotiator dealing with the talks. But he hopes the Brexit talks do not affect the wider relationship, he says. He says the relationship is not just about geography; it is rooted “in some very strong human bonds”. He and May will witness this at an event later today at the V&amp;A Museum, he says. Macron says he will not cover all the areas of cooperation discussed today. They include nuclear power, space, and the economy. And they discussed sports events too, he says. Macron says they want to comm Turning to Calais, he says he visited recently. The “jungle” has been dismantled. What is happening in Calais is “not satisfactory”, he says. He says today the interior ministers signed a joint treaty affecting the border at Calais. It will all border control to be improved. And it will lead to a smarter and more efficient management of the border. The new treaty covers unaccompanied children, he says. It will allow for the time taken dealing with cases to be reduced from six months to one month for adults, and six months to 25 days for children. Vulnerable children, not covered by the Dublin convention, will also be affected. The new treaty will ensure a “more human” approach to border control, he says. He says there is a lot of cross-border trade. For trade to flourish, the border needs to be safe, he says. Macron says May announced support for an operation in the Sahel. The offer of the three Chinook helicopters is a strong token of the UK’s commitment, he says. He says they also talked about defence in Europe. It is fundamental that the strong relationship between the two countries will continue, he says. The UK-French relationship will contribute to the European defence initiative, he says. Macron says they discussed the Sahel and Africa. The British announced their contribution to a French initiative. He says they have development projects with joint goals, particularly the education of girls. He says there is also a need for a joint approach to strategic defence. Their agreements on this are not affected by Brexit. The defence relationship between the two countries is unique, as can be seen in various theatres of action. They can work together quickly. He says the communique being issued today will set out areas where the two countries are working together. Emmanuel Macron is speaking now. He starts in English, thanking May for his welcome. Then he switches to French. He says there are two things that cannot be changed by Brexit - our history and our geography. That means we face common challenges, and have a shared destiny, he says. He says many people now are used to living on both sides of the Channel. He says the two countries want to have the same approach to foreign policy. They want to work closely together. And they want the whole of Europe to work together, for example on Iran. May says both countries are committed to innovation. They want to deepen cooperation on research. She says she and Macron think everyone in society deserves the same opportunities. She and Macron will work to make this happen. They will promote exchanges between schools, and allow students to cross the Channel. She says the Bayeux Tapestry will come to the UK in 2022. It will be the first time it has been on British soil for more than 900 years. She is honoured to have it in the UK, she says. May says both countries have seen appalling terrorists attacks since the last Anglo-French summit. For the first time in history, all of the heads of British and French intelligence agencies came together for a meeting. They briefed May and Macron on their work. She says Macron and she remain committed to the Le Touquet agreement. And they have confirmed additional measures. The security infrastructure at Calais will be reinforced. The new investment will make the borders even more secure. She says they want to close down networks of people smugglers. May says France and the UK must work together to meet the challenges of our time. She can confirm today that a joint force of up to 10,000 will be available to deploy together. The two countries worked together to combat Ebola. And they will step up their efforts in the Sahel, she says. She says the two countries have also agreed to work together on EU-Africa peace funding. And they will stand together against Russia. Theresa May opens with a couple of sentences in French (a bit hesitant). Now she is back to English, and talking about the Anglo-French relationship. The two countries are committed to protecting democracy. But the relationship goes beyond defence and security, she says. After the UK leaves the EU, it will remain a “steadfast partner” to its EU allies. Cabinet ministers are taking their seats in the press conference room. The press conference will start in 10 minutes, Sky says. And wildlife crime was on the summit agenda too, Boris Johnson says. This is from Gerard Collomb, the French interior minister. The French embassy has provided a translation. The press conference is now due to start at 6pm, journalists have been told. This is from the Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association’s chief political photographer. The hacks at Sandhurst are not happy. These are from the Times’ Matt Chorley. Here is the “family photo” from the summit. Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron are about to hold a press conference. This is what the Press Association filed about the summit earlier. Theresa May has welcomed President Emmanuel Macron for summit talks which will see Britain commit tens of millions of pounds to strengthen UK border controls in France. The French president, making his first visit to Britain since entering the Elysee Palace, was greeted at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, with a guard of honour from the Coldstream Guards. Before the ceremonial welcome, the two leaders enjoyed a working lunch at the Royal Oak pub in Paley Street, in May’s Maidenhead constituency. Officials said the £44.5m cash injection would go towards fencing, CCTV and detection technology in Calais and other ports along the Channel. Part of the money will also go towards helping relocate people away from Channel ports to prevent another migrant camp from forming as it did in Calais in 2015. Britain could also commit to taking in a higher proportion of child refugees from France as part of its commitment to resettle 480 unaccompanied children under the Dubs scheme, it is understood. Figures show more than 750 children have been transferred to Britain through various routes since the “Jungle” camp was shut down in 2016. May’s official spokesman said on Wednesday: “We have given a clear commitment in relation to child refugees following the Dubs amendment. “The work to identify unaccompanied minors in and around the Calais area continues and where it’s appropriate to find them homes in the UK we’re determined to do so.” The French president has been pressing for Britain to increase its financial contribution as well as a commitment to take more refugees ahead of his first visit to the UK as president. A government spokeswoman said: “This is about investing in and enhancing the security of the UK border. “Just as we invest in our borders around the rest of the UK, it is only right that we constantly monitor whether there is more we can be doing at the UK border controls in France and Belgium to ensure they are as secure as possible.” The summit is also an opportunity for the two leaders to underline their countries’ enduring ties, despite Britain’s impending withdrawal from the EU. Increasing co-operation on defence and counter-terrorism will be high on the agenda at an event which will see the first meeting together of the heads of the two countries’ main intelligence agencies. The heads of MI5, MI6, GCHQ and France’s DGSE and DGSI will discuss how they can work together to counter threats such as the targeting of concert venues like Manchester Arena and the Bataclan in Paris, and terrorists using the internet as a “safe space”. Britain will also commit to participating in Mr Macron’s “European intervention initiative”, which officials do not regard as a European army but a plan to enhance co-ordination of existing armed forces. Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron have agreed the creation of a UK-France defence ministerial council, the Ministry of Defence says. In his excellent book about the general election and Theresa May’s first year in office, Fall Out, Tim Shipman reveals that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, privately backs building a new Channel Tunnel for cars. Shipman quotes Johnson as saying: If you wanted to show your commitment to Europe, is it not time for us to have further and better economic integration with a road tunnel? That’s what we need ... You could come out of the EU but join Europe in the most fundamental way ... You undo the damage done at the end of the ice age. The Channel is really a river whose tributaries used to be the Seine and the Thames. It became bigger and bigger and bigger as the ice melted until it separated Britain from France. According to Shipman, Johnson was keen to float the plan at the Conservative conference in 2016 but was talked out of his by his advisers. However, it now seems Johnson is keen to revive the idea. He has just tweeted this from the Anglo-French summit. There has been some speculation among the political classes in the Irish Republic that Leo Varadkar might go for broke this Spring and call a general election. The theory is that the Taoiseach who leads a minority coalition might gain encouragement from the next major opinion poll on the state of Irish parties at the end of January and consider going to the country in April. At present Varadkar relies on his very own ‘confidence and supply arrangement’ of the type the DUP has to keep Theresa May in 10 Downing Street. The Taoiseach and his Fine Gael party not only need the support of an alliance of Independent Dail deputies but also the qualified backing of the main opposition party Fianna Fail. A series of polls that put Varadkar and his party further ahead of Fianna Fail may tempt him to dissolve the Dail after his trip to the White House on St Patrick’s Day. There is even speculation that Fine Gael may even to a deal with Sinn Fein, which will be led by Dublin TD Mary Lou McDonald to set up a stable coalition. Varadkar’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney was asked today if this potential scenario would convince Sinn Fein it would be useful to be in government both in Belfast and Dublin thus giving new hope of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland. Coveney’s reply was unequivocal: “I don’t see any prospect of a general election in the Republic of Ireland any time soon.” Here are some more pictures from the May/Macron summit. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative party deputy chairman who now specialises in researching public opinion, has published a new poll today. The findings are worth reading in full, but here are three that stand out. 1 - Voters will clearly back a second referendum - but only if it’s a choice between Brexit with a deal, and Brexit with no deal. Ashcroft asked four different questions about a possible second referendum, and if staying in the EU is an option, voters are against. He explains. There was no significant variation in support for a new referendum in any of the scenarios: between 38 and 40 per cent depending on the question. Opposition to a new referendum outweighed support (indeed with between a quarter and a fifth of remainers answering in the negative) in all scenarios but one: a choice between accepting the terms negotiated for Brexit, or leaving without a deal – that is, a referendum which would result in Britain leaving the EU in any event. This was both the least unpalatable option to leavers, a quarter of whom supported the idea, and the least attractive to remainers, only 57 per cent of whom were in favour. 2 - “Don’t know” has now overtaken both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn in the ‘Who would make best PM?’ chart. 3 - Labour is ahead of the Conservatives on most key ‘party character’ traits - although both parties have seen their ratings fall on these measures since last summer. Gary Gibbon’s Channel 4 News blog about the May/Macron summit is worth reading. Here’s an excerpt. One cabinet minister said the French are indisputably the most formidable challenge to Britain in the Brexit negotiations. The minister said there were strong suspicions that Paris was keen to stretch out the negotiations over a transition phase to prolong uncertainty for UK businesses pondering a move to Paris. One other theme you repeatedly hear on the transition is how many EU capitals are convinced that the UK is going to need a status quo transition that lasts long after the end of 2020 (the current working notion of an end date). But EU officials say extending the transition is too controversial a topic to introduce into Britain’s fragile political state, and not something the EU27 particularly want to complicate their lives with at the moment either. If it is needed later it can be negotiated then, the rationale runs, and the EU27 will have more leverage in that conversation because the UK needs would be that much more pressing. This is from Romain Raoux, who works for the French embassy in London. (Clearly a man who deserves a pay rise.) The Telegraph’s Jack Maidment has more on Theresa May’s lunch with Emmanuel Macron. Sajid Javid, the housing secretary, has announced changes to planning rules intended to help music venues and other places that generate noise that could affect residential properties. As he explains in a news release, under the new system “housing developers building new homes near music venues should be responsible for addressing noise issues.” Currently it is up to music venues to find a solution to noise problems, even when developers build homes next door knowing there is a potential difficulty. UPDATE: The news release acknowledges that this change is being adopted partly as a result of pressure from the Labour MP John Spellar, who put forward a 10-minute rule bill on this topic. More from a very busy schedule for Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley today. The secretary of state had to issue an urgent clarification on the status of the £1bn deal the Democratic Unionists extracted from the Tories to keep Theresa May in power. Initially in a press briefing inside Stormont House Bradley said that the largesse from central government to the DUP and Northern Ireland was dependent on devolved ministers being in place in Belfast. In other words the extra £1bn could only be spend once devolved power sharing was back up and running. But the DUP and indeed her predecessor James Brokenshire always insisted the £1bn aid package was not contingent on the Northern Ireland Executive being restored after over a year of political stasis. This was actually raised at the briefing by another reporter. In later statement this afternoon, Bradley said the government’s preference is to have “elected ministers spend the money” in the region but added that the £1bn the DUP secured would still be spent in the absence of devolution. The new Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has been described by Democratic Unionist Party MP Ian Paisley as a solid unionist in outlook. But on one issue she is poles apart from the DUP - gay marriage equality. Bradley voted in favour of gay marriage equality law which does not apply to Northern Ireland where it is a devolved issued. The DUP has used a special parliamentary veto in the now deadlocked Stormont Assembly to block legislation that would make LGBT marriages legal in Northern Ireland. While Bradleywas focussed mainly today on announcing talks aimed at restoring power-sharing government in Northern Ireland (see 2.22pm), the secretary of state was asked about what she was going to do about the region being the only part of the UK were gay marriage is not recognised in law. “I am not here to impose,”Bradley answered, means the status quo remains. Only when the Stormont Assembly is back up and running, and if (as seems unlikely) the DUP lifts its opposition to gay marriage will the current scenario change. A number of Ulster Unionist politicians had earlier proposed on Thursday that one way around the problem was for the Westminster government to legislate for a referendum in Northern Ireland allowing the people of the region to vote for or against gay marriage. Bradley, at least for today, appears to have kicked that particular idea out to touch. Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron have arrived at Sandhurst. They were greeted with the French national anthem (which is much better than ours, according to the consensus in the office.) And for those of you who like this sort of thing - a marching band. More from Sandhurst. This is from ITV’s Carl Dinnen. Emmanuel Macron has tweeted some video of his working pub lunch with Theresa May. Jeremy Corbyn has given an interview to my colleagues Heather Stewart and Anushka Asthana. As they report, he said that Labour would call a halt to the “outsourcing racket” exposed by Carillion’s collapse by tearing up procurement rules to make the public sector the default choice for providing government services. Here is the main story. And here is the interview feature. Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has described the need to restore power sharing government to the region as “urgent” as she announced a fresh round of talks today aimed at bringing back devolution. A new set of negotiations will begin next week involving the main parties represented in the deadlocked Stormont Assembly, the secretary of state said. But she warned that these discussions which start on 24 January will be the last chance to reach a deal. Standing alongside side Bradley outside Stormont House on Thursday, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said he believed the deadline to find a solution would be “weeks rather than months.” Bradley said she still believed an agreement was possible as “all the parties have expressed a commitment for the restoration of the (Stormont) Executive.” Bradley continued: “They are willing to engage in a constructive manner to try to reach agreement. A short intense set of political talks to restore the executive will commence next Wednesday.” She said the gaps between the parties particularly the largest two - the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein - were “narrow but there are still significant differences to overcome.” In the absence of a deal, she said she would have to consider drawing up a Westminster-imposed budget and addressing the issue of continued pay for Northern Irish politicians if no Assembly was functioning by then. Asked if she was in favour of cutting local politicians’ wages if they failed to reach an agreement to reboot both the Executive and the Assembly, Bradley said: Well as a politician myself I work very hard to make sure I justify my pay so I will say no more than that! Theresa May’s lunch with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, seems to have over-run, says Sky’s Faisal Islam. They were supposed to be at Sandhurst by now for the Anglo-French summit but have not appeared yet. In a speech to the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath tonight Lord Owen, the former foreign secretary who quit Labour for the SDP in the 1980s partly because Labour was turning anti-European but who campaigned for leave in the referendum, will call for the UK to remain in the EEA (European Economic Area) during the Brexit transition. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has previously described a transition deal keeping the UK in the EEA as the “worst of possible worlds”. But Owen will argue that staying in the EEA for that period will be the most practical option. He will say: In responding, therefore, to the EU wish for the withdrawal agreement to be “clearly defined and precisely limited in time” the UK government would be wise to state now that they are ready to rely for legislative purposes during the transition chiefly upon the European Economic Area Agreement during the transition to which we are a contracting party. This does not resolve all issues – transitory status quo arrangements for agriculture and fisheries will still be required – also while the customs union is allowed under the EEA neither Norway, Sweden nor Liechtenstein thought it necessary to take it up. The withdrawal agreement, it is clear from the outset, is for the transition and no longer than the transition period which is currently planned to end no later than 30 December 2020. We can set aside legal arguments as to whether or not a contracting party to the EEA agreement ceases to be one if they leave the EU by making provision for the small amendments that make it clear that the UK will continue to be a contracting party to the EEA within the withdrawal agreement. As such an amended EEA Agreement will respect our sovereignty, as it does for Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein ... This EEA transition option plainly gives the UK more power and control over subsequent developments than would the European council’s proposal of last December. But it would also be easier for EU members. It follows precedent and in some parts would be bespoke but it means much of the legal provision is contained in a well understood international treaty with its own legal framework. It ought to unite all shades of Leave opinion, and attract some remainers who recognise the need in practical negotiations to start to respect the referendum decision. In an interesting interview with the New Statesman Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has hinted that he is open to the idea of funding the NHS through a hypothecated tax. Here is an extract from George Eaton’s article. Labour’s 2017 manifesto vowed to increase spending by raising taxes on corporations and the top 5 per cent of earners (those on salaries of more than £80,000). But Ashworth suggested that a more ambitious settlement was needed. “Under the previous Labour government, Gordon Brown laid out a case for the long-term investment needs of the National Health Service and then increased national insurance and hypothecated the yield from that to the NHS. That was actually a popular tax rise.” (A 2002 ICM poll found that 76 per cent of voters backed the policy.) Conservative MPs such as Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the health select committee, former minister Nick Boles and backbencher Johnny Mercer have recently supported a dedicated NHS tax. “It’s an interesting debate and it’s a debate that we should engage in,” Ashworth told me. “The country needs to have a discussion about the future financing of the NHS for the 2020s and the 2030s.” Sir John Armitt has been appointed as chair of the national infrastructure commission, replacing the Labour peer Lord Adonis, who resigned at the end of last year, partly in protest over Brexit. Armitt was deputy chair of the commission. Previously he was chief executive of Network Rail, president of the Institution of Civil Engineers and chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The Labour Treasury team does not agree with Stella Creasy’s call for a windfall tax on companied with PFI contracts. (See 9.23am.) John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has not responded to what Creasy said on the Today programme this morning, but sources familiar with his thinking say he does not think the Creasy plan would deal properly with the failings of PFI. One problem is that it would not raise anything from firms involved in PFI that have not made profits (like Carillion, which has gone bust). More seriously, sources argue, a windfall tax would not reduce PFI financing costs and it would still leave these projects in private hands. McDonnell’s plan is to bring them in-house. Although today’s FMQs didn’t deal with Brexit-related questions specifically, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, still managed to work in a barb when answering Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson about “the week that we found out that the Scottish Tories don’t have a backbone between them”. She was referring to the fact that yesterday Davidson’s Scottish Tory MPs - unsurprisingly - voted with their government to pass the EU withdrawal bill through the Commons although it failed to bring forward amendments to a highly contentious clause that centralises more than 100 European powers in Whitehall after Brexit, even though they involve policy controlled by the devolved parliaments. The amendments to clause 11 must now be dealt with in the Lords, where the SNP have no direct representation because they do not send members to the unelected chamber in principle. In fairness, many Scottish Tories are privately fuming at the way that Holyrood’s concerns have been handled, and Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, described herself as “frustrated” in a recent interview. Later today a group of senior MSPs will attend talks in the Lords in order to set out significant cross-party concerns over the lack of progress from the Westminster government on amending the Bill during its Commons passage. In a unanimous report last week Holyrood’s constitution committee described the bill as it stands as “incompatible with the devolution settlement” and made clear that legislative consent to the EU withdrawal bill would not be forthcoming from Holyrood unless clause 11 was replaced or removed. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has finally announced when MPs are going to get round to the long-awaited debate on what to do about restoring the Palace of Westminster. But she has been criticised for giving MPs the chance to delay yet again a project deemed essential to experts. To recap: the Houses of Parliament, which were rebuilt in the middle of the nineteenth century after the fire in 1834, are in an appalling condition and in need of multi-billion pound repairs. This has been acknowledged for years, and in 2015 a report was published saying a renovation programme was needed that could cost more than £7bn and last up to up to 40 years. After that a joint committee of MPs and peers was set up to consider the options. It produced a report (pdf) in September 2016 saying that there was a “clear and pressing” need to act “to prevent catastrophic failure in the next decade”. It recommended “a full decant” (parliamentarians moving out of the building for good during the repairs, which would be cheaper than options allowing MPs and peers to remain fully or partly) and said a “delivery authority” should be appointed to start planning the work “as soon as possible”. But since then the government and parliament have delayed taking a decision. Many MPs and peers are thought to be very unhappy about the idea of moving out of one of the most famous buildings in the world, and they fear that voters will object to so much money being spent on parliament. Today Leadsom announced that the debate on what do to next, which had been expected in early January, will finally take place on Wednesday 31 January. But it will only be a half-day debate, taking place roughly between 4pm and 7pm after a debate on a Labour motion. And MPs will get the chance to vote for a motion putting off any long-term decision until 2022. Leadsom has tabled two motions for MPs to choose between (you can find the text of both motions on this document [pdf] on pages 53 and 54) and the first one says only “essential work” will be carried out this parliament, with a review before 2022 deciding what comprehensive work might take place after that election. If that motion fails, MPs will instead vote on an alternative motion calling for the work to start “as early as possible in the next decade”. This motion would also establish a sponsor board to decide what whether or not to go ahead with the “full decant” option - even though the joint committee took a decision on this. In the Commons Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, accused Leadsom of not taking the problem seriously. She said the government should allocate more time for the debate and, referring to John Bercow’s love of tennis, she said: Mr Speaker, I can only think of one phrase that you are very familiar with in tennis circles, the government “cannot be serious”. It is as if the joint committee have never met. The joint committee took the evidence and reported and all the government does in their motion is to note it. Can the government think again and retable the motions. But Leadsom rejected this claim. She told Vaz. The House needs to decide whether we can afford to justify the undoubted work that needs to take place to restore this Palace, a UNESCO world heritage site that has over 1m visitors a year, at a time when there are great fiscal constraints. It is a genuinely open decision that the House needs to make and, what the government has sought to do is, taking into account the very broad range of views across the House on what should happen, is to put forward first of all the open discussion about whether the House is willing to bear that cost from the taxpayers’ purse, and then secondly, if the House does believe that now is the time, then how can we go about doing that to ensure the very best value for taxpayers’ money. Although Leadsom described it as “an open decision” for MPs (ie, a free vote matter), the fact that the government is putting the option of postponing the decision for another four years on the table suggests that it would be happy for this to be the outcome. If you are curious as to why the restoration project is deemed essential, do read the long read on this topic that my colleague Charlotte Higgins wrote at the end of last year. Charlotte discovered that the state of the building is so bad that there is a real fear that it could effectively collapse into a pile of shit. Here’s an extract from her article. Down a gloomy corridor and a further series of damp steps, announced by a different kind of odour, are two vast, cast-iron vessels – the palace sewage ejectors, in which the effluent produced by parliamentarians and staff gathers before it is pushed into the city drains. They were installed in 1888. “One of them could easily crack,” said Piper. “We get sewage leaks throughout the palace.” Lord Lisvane told me that one of the palace’s disaster-planning exercises, undertaken when he was clerk of the Commons, had imagined a failure of the sewage system. “In that scenario, we had 36 hours before we had to evacuate the building. Aside from all the rather unpleasant stuff about the rising levels of sewage, the fact is that when it hits the high-tension electricity cables, the electricity is out, you don’t have any fresh water, and you are done for.” David Gauke, the justice secretary, has been sworn in today as lord chancellor, the role he holds alongside his post as head of the Ministry of Justice. He is the first solicitor to hold the role. (For years the job always used to go to a barrister, but the Labour government effectively downgraded the job and, under David Cameron, Chris Grayling became the first non-lawyer to hold the post.) At his swearing in Gauke said: As lord chancellor, I look forward to working with you, lord chief justice, and other senior members of the judiciary, to ensure we continue to attract exceptional and talented people in order for it [the judiciary] to remain strong, free from improper influence and truly independent - indeed, to remain the envy of the world. During my time as lord chancellor, I will be ambitious for our country’s legal services, I will be steadfast in my commitment to defend the independence of the judiciary and to respect the rule of law, and I will be determined in our work to create a justice system that is open to all, a justice system that everyone in the country can have confidence in and one that lives up to the deep-rooted sense of justice and fairness the UK is known for around the world. The Labour party has announced the appointment of two new whips - Fiona Onasanya and Stephanie Peacock. Last week A&amp;E doctors working in the NHS in England wrote an open letter to Theresa May saying the risk to patients was “intolerable” because the NHS was so under-funded and short staffed. Now some hospital consultants in Wales have written a similar letter to Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister. As the BBC reports, the letter says: We have neither sufficient staff nor sufficient beds [in either acute hospitals or the community] to cope with the needs of an ageing population. Transport questions in the Commons has seen some focus on Carillion and its work on HS2. We’ve probably not learned much except that Labour clearly plans to target Chris Grayling for signing Carillion up to a contract on the project last year. Grayling began by insisting that Carillion’s collapse would have no effect on HS2, as it was part of a three-company consortium, and the other two firms were taking over its work. “The apprenticeships are being transferred, the staff are being transferred, the project will continue uninterrupted,” he said. But Andy McDonald, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, challenged Grayling on his expressions of confidence in July last year about Carillion. McDonald said: “Does he now accept that he got it spectacularly wrong and that his judgement and his confidence were disastrously misplaced?” Grayling, as you’d expect, did not, and also rebuffed McDonald’s suggestion, quoted from a damning anti-Grayling editiorial in the Times this week (paywall), “whether it is time that this transport secretary left the station”. Transport questions also saw a first outing on the subject for Jo Johnson, newly moved from being universities minister. An early question to Johnson was about a specific promise on rail services between Plymouth and Exeter. As he stood up you the TV coverage clearly picked up a loud whisper from the front bench, “Tell him we’re still working on it!” And that was, oddly enough, what Johnson said. The SNP has welcomed a YouGov poll in today’s Times (paywall) suggesting that the tax increases proposed by the Scottish government at the end of last year are popular with voters. The tax increases have not come into force yet, but the approval rates in the poll are striking. Getting public support for tax increases is the holy grail of progressive politics. Here are the figures. Derek Mackay, the SNP’s business convenor in the Scottish parliament, said: This poll shows strong 2 to 1 support for the SNP’s progressive tax reforms that will allow us to invest in our schools and hospitals. The SNP is on the side of Scotland’s taxpayers – ensuring that 70% pay less and that Scotland is the fairest taxed part of the UK and, for most, the lowest. This is a real endorsement of the SNP’s approach to protecting public services, investing in the economy and supporting households and I hope other parties will now back our tax plans. The SNP government’s proposed tax increases (which take advantage of new powers the Scottish parliament has to vary income tax) may be popular, but they are not simple. The UK currently has three income tax rates (20%, 40% and 45%), but in Scotland in 2018-19 there will be five. Here is the SNP’s own summary of what the plans are. A new starter rate of 19% will be introduced for those earning between £11,850 and £13,850 A basic rate of income tax at 20% for those earning over £13,850 A new intermediate rate of 21% for those earning over £24,000 - however as a result of the new starter rate taxpayers earning less than £33,000 will pay no more in tax for given incomes A higher rate of 41% on incomes over £44,273 to £150,000 A top rate of 46% on incomes over £150,000 Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted about PFI and the NAO report. Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, has received a rare rebuke from the Welsh assembly this morning. Simon Thomas, the Plaid Cymru AM (assembly member) who chairs the assembly’s finance committee, has issued a statement criticising Cairns for refusing to appear before it to give evidence. Thomas said: This committee is frustrated and disappointed at the continuing reticence of the secretary of state for Wales, the right honourable Alun Cairns AM, to appear before us on matters essential to the governance and performance of Wales. Thorough scrutiny and accountability are critical parts of any minister’s portfolio, regardless of the institution in which they sit. This committee’s work is considering matters which will affect every person in Wales, including the devolvement of tax-raising powers later this year. The secretary of state is statutorily obliged to report on the implementation of the Wales Act 2014, but will not attend committee to discuss these annual reports. Thomas said his committee had offered Cairns a number of possible dates for a hearing since he was appointed Welsh secretary in 2016, and even offered to question him via video conference, but had still not got an acceptance. National Audit Office reports are never an easy read and their conclusions are always relatively cautious and qualified (not least because the relevant government departments are consulted before they are published). But, if you know how to decipher them, they can be damning, and today’s is a good example because it casts doubt on the entire value of PFI, the public finance initative, and its successor PF2 - and, by implication, the wisdom of getting the private sector to deliver public services. Coming just days after the collapse of Carillion, it could not be more more topical. If you want, you can read the report in full here (pdf). Here is my colleague Rajeev Syal’s overnight story summarising it. This morning Labour said today’s NAO report showed why the party was right to commit itself to ending PFI and bringing existing projects back in house. (John McDonnell announced this at the party conference last autumn, although the policy small print made it clear that the actual plans are not quite as radical as the headlines generated by McDonnell’s speech implied.) In a statement today Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: The National Audit Office confirms that, not only is there little evidence of the benefits of private finance procurement, but also that it “results in additional costs compared with publicly financed procurement”. According to the NAO’s analysis of a schools building project, costs under the Tories’ new PF2 schemes are 40% higher than through direct government funding. Worryingly, despite this and the Office for Budget Responsibility’s description of PFI as a “fiscal illusion”, it seems that the Treasury has actively decided against removing budgetary incentives which exist in favour of PFI. Today’s report only further demonstrates this Tory government’s continued commitment to fleecing tax payers for the benefit of large PFI firms. It also raises more questions over the use of PFI in a week in which the Carillion scandal has left many fearing for their jobs and standard of their public services. The next Labour government will draw a line under the failed PFI approach to public investment, and will replace it by a transparent and accountable approach, which will reduce the costs and deliver significant savings to the taxpayer.” But on the Today programme a Labour MP, Stella Creasy, offered another proposal. Creasy first made her name as an MP campaigning against payday lenders and she described PFI firms as “the legal loan sharks of the public sector”. What the NAO reports shows, to devastating effect, is that PFI and PF2, because the government brought in exactly the same scheme under a different name, is both too expensive to continue on with and very expensive to get out of. Of that £10bn [the annual charge for PFI contracts] what that study also shows is that half of that is interest on charges. These companies, these type of contracts, really are the legal loan sharks of the public sector. It’s like a payday loan or a hire purchase agreement to build a school or a hospital and then run one. It’s a very expensive way to do it. And the question we all have to ask ourselves is what do we do next. Creasy said, given the difficulties of halting PFI contracts, the government should instead consider imposing a windfall tax on these firms. This is why I’m calling for a windfall tax on these companies. The one place where we do have leverage with them is on the tax they pay. They’ve also had a massive corporation tax bonus because corporation tax on a lot of these contracts [when they] were signed, and it was part of the deal and the reason why we went with them, was around 30%. Under this government it has now dropped to 17%. So we are estimating that some of them have saved around £190m in corporation tax payments alone. That is money that is owed to our public sector, and is money we could get back with a windfall tax. I will post more on this as the morning goes on. Then, this afternoon, the main even will be Theresa May’s summit with Emmanual Macron. Here is our preview story. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.10am: Jeremy Corbyn visits a hospital and ambulance trust in Lincoln. 9.30am: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: NHS England publishes weekly performance statistics. 12.45pm: Theresa May has lunch with the French president Emmanual Macron. Later they will hold a summit at Sandhurst, followed by a press conference at 5pm. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Supporters claim a new generation of nuclear plants is the most effective means of helping to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, while filling the 'energy gap' that will result from the decommissioning of old fossil fuel and nuclear power facilities in the 2020s. But opponents believe it is an expensive folly, replete with ethical and environmental effects that have repercussions for generations to come, siphoning money and attention away from renewables. The debate took on another dimension in 2011, when the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to the meltdown of three of the Fukushima nuclear power plant's reactors. In response, Germany cancelled its nuclear programme, embarking on the 'energiewende' (energy shift), which aims to produce 60% of Germany's power through renewable sources by 2050. By contrast, the UK is proposing to build a new generation of nuclear power plants, starting with Hinkley Point C. \"A new generation of nuclear power stations, alongside renewables and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, is a key part of our future low carbon energy mix,\" a DECC spokesperson told the Guardian, \"and will contribute to the UK's vision of providing safe, reliable and low carbon energy for the future. Nuclear is expected to be one of the cheapest sources of low carbon electricity in the future.\" Peter Haslam, public policy advisor for the Nuclear Industry Association, said that while nuclear isn't \"the only way of meeting the energy gap... (we) need to do something if we're going to keep the lights on. We're going to have to replace our existing high-carbon capacity with low-carbon generation.\" Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power station in the UK since Sizewell B, which started generating electricity in 1995. Along with 11 other new nuclear power stations the government hopes to see built, this would transform what has for some time been a legacy industry into one that would provide 16 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2030. Hinkley Point C is projected to provide electricity for 6m homes, meeting approximately 7% of the UK's demand when running at full capacity. But the proposals are controversial, not least due to the cost involved. All new nuclear builds involve high capital expenditures. However, many opponents of the Hinkley plan claim the £92.5/MWh strike price, the loan guarantee promised by the Treasury, liability issuance provided to EDF by the Government, and other financial measures actually amount to subsidies by another name – transferring liability onto British electricity customers and taxpayers for at least 35 years. \"There are two other other consortia who might build nuclear reactors at other sites in the future, but they haven't been involved in the strike price negotiations,\" said Dr David Lowry, an independent research policy consultant specialising in nuclear. \"The result of that is that EDF had a monopoly over the government as to whether or not the government would agree to take the strike price or not.\" The strike price for offshore wind is higher, pegged at £155/MWh, but Lowry claims this must be balanced by the fact that contracts only last 15 years. Nuclear Free Local Authorities chair, Councillor Mark Hackett, said investing in nuclear is the wrong approach, \"particularly in the light of the Fukushima disaster. The gargantuan cost of £16bn dwarfs previous energy projects, and is likely to make it the most expensive to build reactor in history. It could also choke off the nascent renewable energy revolution in the UK, turning off investors in offshore wind and solar at a time when such industries are rapidly taking off elsewhere in Europe\". In addition, the coalition agreement promised that new nuclear sites would not receive state financial aid. The European Commission has doubts that the estimated £17.6 bn in financial aid for the Hinkley deal can be justified. Many environmentalists have expressed concerns over how the nuclear waste from these new reactors will be dealt with. Cumbria recently rejected government plans for an underground nuclear waste disposal facility, and the costs of cleaning up the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site in the region have rocketed past £70bn. \"That site is so polluted and so nasty, and they just don't know what to do with it,\" claimed Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, \"so every time a new government comes in they just keep it going, they don't deal with it.\" However, Haslam counters that any new build plant operators \"will have to, by law, put aside funds as the stations move through their lives to ensure that there is a fund there in place at the end of their lifetime to provide for the decommissioning\". Supporters of the new build programme believe it will provide a springboard for UK business to compete in a global nuclear energy market. New fast breeder reactors could also help address many environmental concerns, turning the UK's stockpile of nuclear waste into nuclear fuel. But the technology is still some way off being demonstrated at scale and will require international collaboration to develop. Given the UK's long nuclear heritage, there is a considerable skills base in the country that the nuclear industry could to draw upon in future too. \"Globally, we've still got a very good reputation in the nuclear sector because we've had 60 years of running successful and safe nuclear power generation,\" said Derek Allen, lead technologist, for energy generation and supply at the Technology Strategy Board, which also invests in innovations for renewables and other forms of energy. Many people still believe the UK is heading down the wrong electricity track, and should emulate Germany and Denmark and invest much more heavily in renewable sources of electricity. The potential for smart meters, increased energy efficiency measures, carbon capture technologies, distributed grids and community energy projects could change the way we consume electricity – and put the nuclear industry out of step with reality. \"The whole energy system is changing,\" added Mitchell, \"and that's really one of the big issues for nuclear power.\" This feature is part of the Guardian's Big Energy Debate series.

The most recent convert is Goldman Sachs: in June, it named Hugh Lawson, a partner and managing director, as its global head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. This move was part of a larger trend: a month later, Goldman acquired Imprint Capital, a boutique investment firm that seeks measurable social and environmental impacts on top of financial returns. “We think ESG is going, in essence, mainstream,” Lawson said. “A wider set of clients is interested.” Those clients include public pension funds, insurance companies, universities and foundations that want their investments to take social and environmental issues into account. Given the size and scope of these large institutional investors, it’s not surprising that some of Wall Street’s major players are getting involved: Goldman and its rivals, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, are following the money, as they always do. In addition to attracting big clients, the sustainable investing initiatives being led by Lawson and others – including Audrey Choi, who leads Morgan Stanley’s global sustainable finance group, and Andy Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions for Merrill Lynch – have the potential to steer more capital into investments that promote corporate sustainability. “Clients are telling us that they want their portfolios to reflect their values and help improve the world they live in,” Sieg has said. Dropping oil without dropping returns Lawson’s interest in sustainable investing emerged while he was serving as a trustee of the investment committee at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Last year, the foundation announced that it was divesting fossil fuels from its endowment. Because the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was created by heirs of oilman John D Rockefeller, this became front-page news. After taking a deep dive into the relationship between divestment and financial returns, Lawson came to believe that eliminating fossil fuel holdings from the fund’s $857m portfolio would not necessarily limit returns. This was a controversial position: many prominent investors argue that fossil fuel divestment puts financial returns at risk. In a statement explaining why Harvard rejected student demands to divest fossil fuels, Drew Faust, the university’s president said that it came down to dollars: “Despite some assertions to the contrary, logic and experience indicate that barring investment in a major, integral sector of the global economy would – especially for a large endowment reliant on sophisticated investment techniques, pooled funds and broad diversification – come at a substantial economic cost.” That’s not necessarily true, Lawson told the Guardian in his first interview since taking his new job in June. By using sophisticated analytical tools, he explained, an asset manager can limit what’s called tracking error – that is, the gap between a fund’s returns and the returns of a benchmark index. Oil and gas investments, for example, can theoretically be replaced by other holdings in the energy sector, commodities or real estate that correlate with fossil fuel assets. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund’s investment committee, which includes Morgan Stanley’s Choi and impact-oriented asset manager Adam Wolfensohn, came to the conclusion that the fund’s decision to divest wouldn’t come with a financial cost. “We haven’t compromised our return profile or increased our risk,” Lawson said. SRI: a shifting conversation The debate between moral values and financial returns isn’t entirely new. So-called “negative screens” have always been part of what used to be known as socially-responsible investing (SRI). With roots in religious communities and the anti-war movement of the 1960s, SRI funds shunned investments in tobacco, alcohol, guns, nuclear power and companies that operated in South Africa during apartheid. However, with the notable exception of the anti-apartheid campaign in South Africa, there’s little or no evidence that these negative screens had much impact. In many ways, the conversation has shifted. According to US SIF, an industry group, the term SRI has shifted meaning from “socially-responsible investment” to “sustainable, responsible and impact investment”. Today, SRI, ESG and sustainable investing – the terminology remains unsettled – is less about negative screens and more about steering capital towards companies or projects that generate positive, measurable social and environmental returns. Goldman and its rivals say they can bring more rigor, sophistication and scale to the field. For example, Impact Capital, the firm acquired by Goldman, makes investments that are explicitly designed to improve the lives of impoverished communities, or to promote conservation or energy efficiency. Lawson offers another hypothetical situation that could show the impact of SRI. An investor concerned about climate change could choose to overweight companies in any sector, including energy, that are the most carbon-efficient. At the same time, he could underweight those whose emissions per unit of revenue or profit are higher than average. Eventually, this could theoretically have an impact on how companies operate, by rewarding businesses with more favorable social and environmental profiles. Such change would take time, of course. “It does have elements of redirecting a supertanker,” Lawson said. “But, cumulatively, one nudge here and one there start to add up.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/mar/09/pop-political-british-musicians-paloma-faith","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-09T08:45:45Z","webTitle":"Pop needs to get political again | Cian Ciarán","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/pop-political-british-musicians-paloma-faith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/pop-political-british-musicians-paloma-faith","fields":{"headline":"Pop needs to get political again","bodyText":"A few months ago, Ukip – the millionaire’s ego trip masquerading as a political movement – came out complaining about leftwing comedians not giving it a chance.

Faith is now taking writer Owen Jones on the road with her in an effort to convince potential Ukip voters to change their mind. We need to start hear more of these voices of political opposition in popular music itself. Young people especially need some good to believe in. In times gone by, there were few things cooler than rallying against the establishment, from Marvin Gaye during the civil rights movement to John Lennon with his anti-war message. Some of the most prominent names in punk and new wave took part in the Rock Against Racism concerts of the late 70s and early 80s, as Elvis Costello and The Clash waged war on the National Front. The Red Wedge Tours of the mid-80s gathered pace with help from acts such as Style Council and The Smiths. I’ve still to ask Noel Gallagher how he ended up endorsing Labour’s campaign, but even he now speaks of being disenfranchised. Subversion is a creative gift so not all political action needs to be overt. The most engaging of issue-based songs, such as Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit or Sam Cooke’s A Change is Gonna Come, are a far cry from the traditional image of the ranting protest singer hammering away on their acoustic guitar. Sometimes anger alone can be an unhelpful emotion in music. I am from north Wales, where we have for decades felt the sustained disdain of the British establishment for the regions, from our valleys being flooded to provide drinking water to English cities, to the building of nuclear power stations in areas of incredible natural beauty, as far away from the Tory-voting heartlands as possible. With my band, Super Furry Animals, we knew how to have fun, but occasionally anger and frustration spilled out. We weren’t what you would call a political band, but at the same time we didn’t shy away from talking about it. Writing songs in Welsh was a natural thing for us as native Welsh speakers to do, but there was undoubtedly an element of defending and promoting our culture against those who would see it eroded. We bought a tank as a promotional tool, but it also made a stand against the civil liberties limiting the Criminal Justice Act, by making the driver/DJ immune to arrest. We joined the campaign for a nuclear-free Wales, and I still take an active interest in the campaign to see nuclear power, and its twin Trident, become things of the past. I’m in awe of young wordsmiths such as Hollie McNish and Stephen Morrison-Burke, who come out and say what needs to be said without a guitar or keyboard in front of them as a crutch or distraction. You need real conviction to be able to say as much as they do, as loud as they do, without any band members around them to share the responsibility. I’m proud to be working with them and others, including Steve Mason – a rare political, musical beast – on a protest album that tries to react to the populist media bombarding us with anti-Islam, anti-immigration, anti-poor people sentiments, seeming to blame anyone but those who hold real power. All the while the public are made to subsidise expensive, long-term energy contracts, transferring public money to the French state, and £100bn is easily found for the folly of a nuclear military “deterrent” while the NHS is sold off in pieces. I wish Britain’s biggest selling artists, such as Ed Sheeran, George Ezra and Sam Smith would join us. As long as British musicians lack political motivation, surely we will get the governments we deserve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2015/aug/07/chuck-schumer-iran-nuclear-deal-disapproval-senate-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-07T20:08:26Z","webTitle":"White House warns Chuck Schumer: disapprove of Iran deal at your own peril","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/chuck-schumer-iran-nuclear-deal-disapproval-senate-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/chuck-schumer-iran-nuclear-deal-disapproval-senate-democrats","fields":{"headline":"White House warns Chuck Schumer: disapprove of Iran deal at your own peril","bodyText":"The White House fired a shot across the bows of New York senator Chuck Schumer on Friday for defying its position on Iran, warning that fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill may remember his voting record when deciding who to elect as their next leader. Though Schumer’s announcement that he would vote in disapproval of the nuclear deal – which leaked mysteriously during the middle of the Republican debate on Thursday – is unlikely to derail the process, it represents an embarrassing rift with a senior Democrat who had once been one of Barack Obama’s staunchest allies. Schumer is expected to take over as leader of the party’s caucus in the Senate when Harry Reid, currently the minority leader, steps down after the next presidential election. But he has defied the president before on a critical issue, questioning last year whether it was right to expend so much political capital pushing through Obama’s signature healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare. This time, Schumer’s opposition to the Iran nuclear deal also coincides with a number of other prominent defections by New York Democrats, including Bronx congressman Eliot Engel, who is also ranking minority member of the House foreign affairs committee. The White House put a brave face on their defections during the last press briefing before Obama departs for a two-week vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, pointing out that more than 12 Democrats had come out in favour of the deal including junior New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “[Schumer’s] announcement was not particularly surprising to anyone here at the White House, even if it was disappointing,” said press secretary Josh Earnest. Earnest also distinguished Schumer’s opposition from that of Republicans, which it says is “ideologically driven” and “making common cause with hardliners in Iran”. But the argument that Schumer’s opposition is more considered since he waited until reading the deal before announcing his opposition also raises the question of whether his criticisms should be taken more seriously by other Democrats. In a calmly worded blogpost defending his decision, the New York senator – who is heavily backed by many Jewish American groups and historically close to Israel on many issues – rejected the notion that opposition to the nuclear deal was the same as favouring military strikes against Iran instead. “I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy,” wrote Schumer. “It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power. “Better to keep US sanctions in place, strengthen them, enforce secondary sanctions on other nations, and pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be,” he added. More than two-thirds of both the House and Senate are required to override a presidential veto of their vote of disapproval and so far few commentators expect enough Democrats to break ranks to make this possible. Nonetheless, the White House and its allies appeared to be trying to drive a wedge between Schumer and the rest of the caucus on Friday in a none-too-subtle dig at his credentials to lead the party after Harry Reid’s retirement. “I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if there were individual members of the Senate Democratic caucus who would consider the voting record of those who want to lead the Democratic caucus,” said Earnest when asked about Schumer’s leadership ambitions. Former Obama advisers and allies on the left of the party were less guarded, calling the decision a betrayal. “We’re going to get the Iran deal done with or without Senator Schumer or anyone else who insists on being trapped in the past when it comes to conflict resolution in the Middle East,” said Democracy for America executive director Charles Chamberlain. “Senator Schumer was wrong when he voted to back the war with Iraq, and he’s wrong to work with Republicans to kill this nuclear deal with Iran, period.” Earnest denied the White House had been involved in the leaking of the decision during the GOP debate, but sources close to Schumer told reporters that Obama was the only one who had been informed of the pending announcement at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/feb/20/george-osborne-climate-change-cheaply","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-20T23:53:50Z","webTitle":"George Osborne wants climate change tackled as cheaply as possible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/20/george-osborne-climate-change-cheaply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/feb/20/george-osborne-climate-change-cheaply","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne wants climate change tackled as cheaply as possible","bodyText":"Climate change should be tackled in \"as cheap a possible way\", George Osborne said on Thursday as he called on environmentalists to drop their \"ideological\" opposition to nuclear power and shale gas. In some of his most significant remarks on climate change since he said in 2011 that Britain should go no faster than any other EU country in cutting carbon emissions, the chancellor said it was important not to be \"theological\" about finding the right energy mix. In a question and answer after a speech to business leaders in Hong Kong, the chancellor firmly rejected arguments posed by some Tory climate change sceptics when he said man is to blame for global warming. The chancellor said: \"I'm someone who believes climate change is happening, that it's caused by human beings. We should do what we can to prevent it and if we can't prevent then mitigate against it for example by building flood defences.\" But Osborne then added that climate change should be tackled in an inexpensive way. He said: \"Where I would differ from some is I would say: 'Let's try and do this in as cheap a possible way as we can'. \"Let's not be too theological about which technology we use – let's get the right mix. For example, there are people in the green movement who oppose civil nuclear power for I would think rather ideological reasons but it's clearly a low-carbon source of energy generation. \"Equally shale gas has done incredible things to reduce US carbon emissions and there are parts of the environmental movement who don't like that, again for rather ideological reasons. I would say let's see more fracking and shale gas in Europe, in the UK and in China.\" Osborne has tried to encourage the exploitation of British shale gas reserves by offering tax breaks. In his speech, he said: \"Far from shying away from difficult issues like nuclear energy and fracking – my government is leading the way in Europe.\" The remarks by the chancellor about tackling climate change in an inexpensive way chime with the message delivered to modernising Tories when a minister, who is a close Osborne ally, said last year that the prime minister wants to get rid of the \"green crap\". The chancellor told the modernisers that he accepts the need to tackle climate change but does not want to harm economic growth in the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/oct/16/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-national-audit-office-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-16T18:02:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C subsidy scheme being investigated by National Audit Office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/16/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-national-audit-office-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/oct/16/hinkley-point-c-subsidy-national-audit-office-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C subsidy scheme being investigated by National Audit Office","bodyText":"The National Audit Office has begun an investigation into the controversial subsidy regime for the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, a week after Brussels approved taxpayer support for the project. The financial watchdog, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, said it would be checking whether the guaranteed prices of £92 a megawatt hour – double the current cost of electricity – represented “value for money”. The NAO move, which follows pressure from a House of Commons committee, puts pressure on the government but has pleased green groups which believe nuclear is getting preferential treatment over windfarms. “Our work will cover the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s commercial approach to securing this deal and the proposed terms of the contract, to report to parliament on value for money and the resulting risks which the Department must manage,” said the NAO in a formal statement. “We will also wish to identify lessons learned to inform decisions on future ‘contracts for difference’,” it added, referring to the new funding mechanism for Hinkley and other low-carbon energy projects. Last week the European commission approved the subsidy scheme, citing government concessions on the project’s funding structure. The parliamentary environmental audit committee (EAC) had called this week for the NAO to hold a full inquiry into the government’s deal. Joan Walley, the committee’s chair, said the “process and outcome” of the deal, as well as whether it represents value for money, should be investigated by the UK authorities now that it has been approved by Brussels. A DECC spokesperson said: “This month the commission agreed that Hinkley represents a good deal for both bill-payers and investors. It’s perfectly ordinary for the NAO to look into large investment contracts and we will be working with them as we move closer to finalising the contract. We will not go ahead with any contract unless it is good value for money.” John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, welcomed the NAO decision, saying: “The stitch-up concocted in Brussels will see two generations of UK consumers locked into paying billions of pounds to a mainly state-owned corporation in France in order to bankroll an outdated and risky source of energy. “This is an extraordinarily bad use of public funds and ministers will have a tough time trying to justify it. This money would be better spent on clean technologies and energy saving measures, which don’t leave a legacy of radioactive waste and benefit the UK economy while reducing carbon emissions.” The decision by the NAO comes just days after Ecotricity and other renewable energy firms said they were considering a legal challenge against the Hinkley financing package. Ecotricity, a wind farm operator, and Solarcentury, a solar power business, said the European commission was wrong to conclude the Hinkley aid would not be detrimental to other low-carbon power producers. Hinkley, a new set of reactors planned for Somerset, has been set a funding scheme paid for by consumers that will last for 35 years, much longer than any previous schemes enjoyed by renewables companies. But EDF, which will build and Hinkley Point C, has defended the funding. It said: “Last week’s approval from the European commission demonstrates that agreements between the government and EDF are fair and balanced for consumers and investors alike.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/oct/05/nuclear-industry-secrets-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-05T09:25:11Z","webTitle":"The nuclear industry still has its secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/05/nuclear-industry-secrets-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/oct/05/nuclear-industry-secrets-edf","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear industry still has its secrets","bodyText":"One of the nuclear industry’s promises for the future is that it will turn its back on its cold war past and be more open and transparent about its dealings. So news last week that at least two of the officials assessing the safety case for new reactors at Hinkley Point C were on the pension roll of the scheme’s developers, EDF, was not encouraging. The design assessment of the new European pressurised reactor (EPR) developed by EDF and its nuclear specialist Areva is important, because it is key to determining whether the public accepts the safety of Hinkley. It is disturbing that the few detailed answers obtained about who exactly undertook that review had to come by way of a Freedom of Information request, not by an immediate and voluntary statement from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR). It would surely be better that former EDF staff are not working on that assessment. But, on the other hand, safety officers have got to get their experience of the industry from somewhere. No doubt the problem is compounded by the fact that more than 25 years have elapsed since Britain last started to build an atomic power station and the wider pool of experts has diminished due to retirement. The ONR has had recruitment difficulties; this may account for the fact that much of this design assessment was way behind schedule, only to be miraculously recovered at the end. Unsurprisingly, independent experts question how thorough the oversight really was – and whether a whole load of problems have been parked to one side to be tackled later on. A senior inspector at the Finnish nuclear regulator STUK, which has been struggling for much longer to assess an EPR reactor for a domestic plant, says pointedly: “I don’t know how they (the ONR) did it so fast.” And for such fast movers, it is odd that the ONR could not provide data on whether any of its inspectors had previously worked for EDF or Areva on the groundsbecause the files were in “deep storage”. That excuse would not have passed muster during the cold war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"weather/2015/sep/11/more-than-20-missing-in-joso-north-of-tokyo-after-days-of-torrential-rain","type":"article","sectionId":"weather","sectionName":"Weather","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-11T08:44:46Z","webTitle":"More than 20 missing in Joso, north of Tokyo, after days of torrential rain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2015/sep/11/more-than-20-missing-in-joso-north-of-tokyo-after-days-of-torrential-rain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/weather/2015/sep/11/more-than-20-missing-in-joso-north-of-tokyo-after-days-of-torrential-rain","fields":{"headline":"More than 20 missing in Joso, north of Tokyo, after days of torrential rain","bodyText":"More than 20 people are missing in a town north of Tokyo following days of torrential rain which weather experts said occurred just once every half a century. As the rescue effort continued in Joso, the town of Osaki, was inundated after a river burst its banks on Friday morning. Japanese media reports said 80 Osaki residents were stranded when the breach sent water levels shortly before dawn. Heavy rain caused by Typhoon Etau earlier this week caused flooding and landslides throughout Japan, forcing the evacuation of more than 100,000 people and causing widespread disruption to rail services. Three people have been confirmed dead, but the death toll could rise once water levels drop and rescue workers are able to properly gauge damage in the worst-affected areas. Fears that rising water levels could threaten the city of Sendai prompted authorities there to advise - though not order - more than 400,000 residents to leave. Etau has moved out into the Sea of Japan but continued to generate record levels of rainfall in several parts of the country. The deluge also caused leaks of rainwater at the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after heavy rain overwhelmed drainage pumps. The rainwater may have come into contact with huge quantities of radioactive water - which becomes contaminated after it is used to cool melted fuel - being stored in tanks at the site. The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said it did not know how much tainted rainwater had flowed into the Pacific ocean, but a spokesman said tests conducted earlier this week showed the incident had “no effect” on the sea. In Joso, 56 kilometres (35 miles) north of Tokyo, about 700 people were left stranded overnight after the Kinugawa river burst its banks along a 140 m stretch, sending a wall of water coursing through the town. The breach was the first in Joso for more than six decades. Kyodo News reported that the flooding had inundated 6,500 homes and spread over more than 30 sq kms Akira Motokawa, an evacuation official in Joso, told public broadcaster NHK that rescuers have been unable to keep up with the volume of calls for help. In scenes that brought back memories of the March 2011 tsunami disaster, torrents of muddy river water wrenched homes from their foundations and submerged cars and farmland. Dramatic TV footage showed members of Japan’s self-defence forces plucking stranded residents from the roofs of buildings and vehicles. The mayor of Joso, Toru Takasugi, said on Friday that 22 people were unaccounted for, while hundreds were still waiting to be rescued. More than 30,000 of Joso’s 65,000 resident were ordered to flee their homes on Thursday, but hundreds more were left stranded. By late last night, more than 3,500 people were staying in evacuation centers, schools and other public buildings. Soldiers were delivering food, blankets and water to about 780 people who were stranded but did not need to be rescued. In Osaki, a town in Miyagi prefecture about 200 miles north of Joso, military personnel began a second major rescue operation from the air after a river burst its banks on Friday morning. Miyagi experienced record levels of rainfall on Friday morning, with heavy rain expected to continue until around noon there and in other parts of north-east Japan. Takuya Deshimaru of Japan’s Meteorological Agency described the situation in Miyagi as “abnormal” and warned that the area was still in “grave danger”. Weather officials and TV presenters repeatedly told residents in flooded areas to continue calling for help and not to attempt to escape by themselves. Those still able to evacuate were instructed to leave their homes in pairs or groups. Military helicopters have been involved in several dramatic rescues of stranded residents. In one, a soldier was seen repeatedly lowering himself onto a building to rescue what appeared to be a family of four. Another helicopter plucked a man in his 60s to safety after he had spent hours holding on to a utility pole, with the water raging around him. Hisako Sekimoto, 62, who was lifted to safety on Friday morning, said she had spent the night on the second floor of her flooded house with her husband and three cats. “There was no time to escape – all we could do was go upstairs,” said Sekimoto, who at one point was up to her neck in water. “I kept praying the water wouldn’t come upstairs.” Reiko Yamaji was one of dozens of people stranded at a supermarket, part of which was submerged. “We spent the night in the car parked on the rooftop parking lot,” the 75-year-old said. “The water supply had been cut and the toilets were out of order, but I’m so glad we all survived.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/may/10/us-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-09T23:58:55Z","webTitle":"US nuclear plant explosion: transformer failure caused fire but no injuries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/10/us-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/may/10/us-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-fire","fields":{"headline":"US nuclear plant explosion: transformer failure caused fire but no injuries","bodyText":"A transformer failed at the Indian Point nuclear power plant in suburban New York, causing a fire that forced an automatic shutdown of a reactor. The fire was quickly extinguished and the reactor was deemed safe and stable, said a spokesman for owner Entergy Corp. The transformer at Indian Point 3 takes energy created by the plant and changes the voltage for the grid supplying power to the state. The blaze, which sent black smoke billowing into the sky Saturday, was extinguished by a sprinkler system and on-site personnel, Entergy spokesman Jerry Nappi said. Westchester County police and fire were on site as a precaution. It was not immediately clear what caused the failure, or whether the transformer would be repaired or replaced. Nappi said there were no health or safety risks. It’s unclear how long the 1,000-megawatt reactor will be down. Entergy is investigating the failure. The plant’s adjacent Unit 2 reactor was not affected. The Indian Point Energy Center in Buchanan, 35 miles up the Hudson River from midtown Manhattan, supplies electricity for millions of homes, businesses and public facilities in New York City and Westchester County. In accordance with federal regulations, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state, county and local officials were notified of the event, considered the lowest of four emergency classifications for US nuclear plants. Governor Andrew Cuomo was briefed on the failure at the site and said officials would review how the emergency was handled to determine if anything could have been done better. Cuomo said the fire had caused oil to leak and could possibly spill into the Hudson River, but crews were working containing it. “These situations we take very seriously. Luckily this was not a major situation. But the emergency protocols are very important,” he said. “I take nothing lightly when it comes to this plant specifically.” But he said there had been too many emergencies of late. Unit 3 had been shut down Thursday morning for an unrelated issue, a water leak on the non-nuclear side of the plant. It was repaired and there was no radioactive release, Nappi said. In March, Unit 3 was shut down for a planned refueling that took about a month. A spokeswoman for the NRC said an agency inspector assigned to the plant was headed there, and the agency would follow up as Indian Point troubleshoots. Spokeswoman Diane Screnci said there was no impact on the public. She said it was not out of the ordinary for a transformer to have a problem, and noted that it was on the non-nuclear side of the plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2013/dec/10/guardian-weekly-letters-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-10T13:59:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 13 December 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/dec/10/guardian-weekly-letters-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2013/dec/10/guardian-weekly-letters-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 13 December 2013","bodyText":"Convincing the sceptics While political global warming sceptics such as Tony Abbott and Stephen Harper, the prime ministers of Australia and Canada, respectively, apparently continue to dispute the link between global warming and human activities (22 November), they and other sceptics cannot doubt these same activities have resulted in a contamination of our rivers and oceans, the air we breathe and even the food we eat. When their own governments and their agencies warn pregnant women to restrict their intake of large predator fish because of contamination with industry-generated heavy metals; when the Chinese government issues warnings to the citizens of Shanghai to remain indoors because of the threat of atmospheric pollutants, pesticides, plastic residues, fluorocarbons; and when flame-retardant chemicals are found in breast milk, even the global warming sceptics would have to agree that these pollutants are the result of human activities. But, then again, I suppose these same sceptics can always deny that pollutants in the air, water, food and breast milk are potentially harmful to our health. Alfred Poulos Adelaide, South Australia • Margaret Wilkes (Reply, 29 November) can take heart from the actions of her neighbour, New Zealand, where climate change \"deniers\" have also persuaded the government that carbon has no price. In a repetition of the 1973 flotilla that heralded the end of atmospheric testing by the French in Muroroa, five yachts set out to forestall the deep sea drilling intentions of oil company Anadarko off the North Island's west coast. They returned on 1 December, having prevented nothing but their message is clear. New Zealand might be peaceful politically but it is not a pushover. The permits granted by the government for oil exploration in much of the deep ocean that surrounds our beautiful coastline are not to every New Zealander's liking and will be met by similar actions. Thousands lined the country's beaches recently to express their support for those few who spent 10 days 160km off shore, surrounding Anadarko's ship. In the 1980s the actions of an initial few led to the passing of our nuclear-free legislation. The nuclear threat remains but that posed by climate change is even more certain. Citizens everywhere must do what they can to persuade governments to reprioritise their energy agendas. Pat Baskett Auckland, New Zealand • In response to Margaret Wilkes's letter asking for suggestions on how to convince Australians that global warming is real: imagine heating your home with coal or wood but not venting the smoke and gases to the outside through a chimney. You'd overheat and suffocate yourself in short order. It's the same principle with the planet. Since we can't vent our fossil-fuel production of heat and gases into outer space, it stays under our roof, our atmosphere. It's a bigger home, of course. But the area is finite. Eventually we overheat the room and poison ourselves. Bill Hanson Leavenworth, Washington, US • Wow, who knew? This is no common revelation to find that there is a link between fast food and success in the world of international power diplomacy (29 November). Might I suggest we send out for a curry, some wonton and a bucket of fried chicken to support the climate talks in Paris in 2015? Global warming will be stopped in its tracks. It really is too bad we can't book the band from the Titanic. Jacques Samuel Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada Pope brings hope to Catholics Being a Catholic can be as mortifying as living in Tony Abbott's Australia; you find yourself constantly subsumed into blanket pronouncements from popes and prime ministers, on behalf of Catholics and Australians, that outrage your sense of what it means to be either. Since it's particularly difficult to hold your head up high when the church is so often – and rightly – pilloried in the media, I was delighted to read Jonathan Freedland's celebratory article: \"The pope may have no army, no battalions or divisions, but he has a pulpit – and right now he is using it to be the world's loudest and clearest voice against the status quo\" (22 November). Catholicism is as deep in me as race or gender; I can't simply extirpate it when it gets uncomfortable, any more than I can renounce being Australian. What's more, I'm a convert, for hidden at the heart of the deeply flawed institution is a pearl of great price, living water I've found nowhere else despite a lifetime of searching. And now, under the current papacy, there's a real possibility of composting some of the worst aspects of the monolith: a hierarchy that can abuse power as corruptly as any of the juntas whose redemption we pray for, body-hatred and damning of sexuality, and above all patriarchy that blights its structures, liturgy, language, morality and doctrine. Might Pope Francis be midwife to the rebirth of a church congruent with its founding vision, with Christ as iconoclast, prophet, mystery, and exemplar of justice, mercy, compassion and truth? Alleluia. Annie March Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Nuclear price is too high In warning about the consequences of the likely catastrophe resulting from a nuclear reactor accident, Naomi Hirose from Tepco introduces a new concept into risk analysis – the prospect that the price of any serious accident would be too great to pay (29 November). Risk analysis indicates that the risk of a nuclear accident is extremely small. However, if that remote chance occurred, could we afford to pay for the consequences? If you take case of Hinkley Point: a serious meltdown accompanied by a large release of radioactivity into a westerly wind would probably render much of southern England uninhabitable. The costs, both economic and social, would be totally unsustainable. Any such event is extremely unlikely, but the awareness of the possibility of a meltdown did not deter the flawed \"safety\" test at Chernobyl, which rendered a huge area of the Ukraine uninhabitable, nor prevent the construction of a reactor close to the sea in an earthquake/tsunami zone at Fukushima. Thus to normal risk analysis, should we perhaps not add the further criterion: can you afford to pay the price if the extremely unlikely actually happens? Peter Borrell Newcastle, UK Cities are not that cool Simon Jenkins (15 November) may consider cities to be cool, but they are rapidly becoming passé; digital technology means the rationale for capital and labour concentration is over. Cities may persist as theme parks, offering nostalgia and sensation for tourists and \"hipsters\", but the city as we know it is doomed. This is evidenced by desperate attempts at civic boosterism and mega-projects, all intended to prop up what is, in fact, an expiring entity. As for elected mayors, we have one here in Toronto; no doubt many readers have read of his exploits. He was elected with 47% of the vote, out of a total turnout of 53%. Just be advised that if you want elected mayors, be sure that councils can get rid of them easily should they prove to be unstable - another election can sometimes be a long time off. Peter R Saunders Toronto, Canada Who is Lady Gaga? OK, I admit I had heard of Lady Gaga, in a vague sort of way, although I really didn't know who she was or what she did exactly in the entertainment world. But after reading Queen of Artpop makes an entrance (29 November), I can't really say I know any more than before about this young woman, apart from the clothes she doesn't wear to interviews (knickers, shoes). It is quite a strange feeling, to have read a whole detailed article in the Guardian Weekly that makes you less informed about a person than you were before you started reading it. Did any other readers feel the same way as I did? Is this a new genre?

Also, Bradman was not subjected to long periods of travel – and when he did tour, it was in great comfort – nor to the constantly high level of opposition, not to mention the numerous forms of the game played today. Tendulkar has displayed remarkable consistency over his 25 years plus career. His stats reflect that: 200 Tests, 329 innings, 15,921 runs, 51 centuries. Time for the Bradman cult to fade into memory.

A man in hi-vis orange walks through, his trousers cut down to shorts, a few inches of coal-dusted thigh showing over the thickest boots; goggled, gloved, protected and unprotected. The coal clogs the miners’ eyes like eyeliner, so that they look incongruously showbiz. Mining is an industry full of contradictions – it’s dangerous, arduous work but people love it. The heat and the humidity take an entire career to get used to, but what everyone talks about is their relationship with their colleagues. Most started straight from school. “There’s quite a lot has never wanted to leave,” Donna Rees, 49, observes later on at the Knottingley miners’ welfare scheme social club. Nobody’s parents wanted them to go down a mine, yet that’s how so many spent their own lives. “When they come out of the mine,” says Keith Poulson, the 55-year-old National Union of Mineworkers representative, “what they’ll be wanting to do is shake each other’s hands, because they might never see each other again.” While many of the 450 miners here live in Pontefract, there are men from as far as Durham and Wales. “They did what Norman Tebbit told them to do,” Poulson says. “They got on their bike. They followed the industry from closure of pit to closure of pit. And this industry has just thrown them on the scrap heap.” In 2013, the decision was made to close Kellingley colliery; Yvette Cooper, who is MP for a neighbouring constituency, describes a series of attempts to save it, including finding investors, a workforce buy-out and applying for EU state aid. “It would have been very easy,” Cooper says, “for the miners to walk away two years ago and the government would have been left with the closure costs.” But they didn’t; instead, they worked to fund the closure and find themselves with a meaner redundancy package than they would have got under Margaret Thatcher. She boosted the statutory amount (12 weeks of average pay) with a £900 per working year deal that has been rescinded. The pension deal has been eroded, too, with those Kellingley miners having to retire early taking a proportional hit to their annuity income for the rest of their lives. It is bizarre to think of Margaret Thatcher’s as the more generous spirited government, but there it is. Chris Atkinson, 57, emerges and swipes himself out of the mine for the last time. He is in a rush to get to the hospital, “only small things wrong with me, but all work-related, yes.” He had just left school when he started here and only meant to stay six months. “I enjoyed the money when I were a young lad, and I liked the camaraderie later. I just think we’ve been stung.” Mark Phelan, 46, says “it’s like losing part of your family, like grieving. You watch each other’s backs down pit and you wash each other’s backs when you come out.” He intends to open a sandwich bar, and shakes his head, smiling: “It’s going to be totally, unbelievably different.” Many people try to pin down the bond between people working in the colliery - whether it was working in close proximity, having each other’s backs, being in high risk work. Part of it is the opacity: nobody who isn’t in it could possibly know what it’s like. The alternatives for those who want to remain in heavy industry are few. Two of the three local power stations are also slated to close. There’s a glassworks, which nobody hangs a huge amount of hope on, though 31-year-old electrician Jonathan Davis has an interview there straight after his last shift finishes. Otherwise, there’s a small amount of agriculture, a bit of distribution. At the social club, Chloe Nadin, 16, Brandon Merchant, 17, and Sydney Brooks, 16, are helping out at the Christmas party for retired miners. Nadin wants to be a midwife and work abroad; Merchant wants to go to Magaluf as a tour rep; Brooks wants to work on cruise liners. “When I came out of school,” Merchant says, “there were no jobs. It’s going to be harder for them that’s known nothing but the colliery.” Nadin agrees: “Most of them we were at school with are commuting to Leeds or Wakefield, but [of the miners] they’re too old to be travelling all that way for a job. There’s nothing round here for us. There’s nothing round here for anyone.” Inside, the previous generation of miners watch a stand-up comedian. “The people that’s done this club up is members,” Rees says of the cavernous, tongue-and-grooved and lino hall that, if it were in London, with no alternation, would be a pop-up lindy-hop club. “I think the community will keep it together, they’ve got to.” There are a couple of voices of determined good cheer. Davis, with the glassworks interview, says: “New year, new start. I’m ready for a new challenge.” “It doesn’t feel like we’re finishing,” says John Gray, 41. “It feels like we’re breaking up for Christmas. We’ve been coaling as usual. I suppose it will sink in once we don’t come back.” But his colleague and friend, Andrew Webb, 50, says: “It’s the end of an era, and the beginning of an error.” Webb started mining in Kent, before moving to Stillingfleet, which closed in 2004, and ending up here. “I’m the last Kentish miner,” he says, wryly. “I go back down to Kent and look at the pit villages: when the mine was running, we had welfare clubs, sports teams, the pubs were booming. The villages were self-policing because of the hierarchy of the mine. Now a lot of those villages are overrun with drug culture. People are just looking to be numbed from everyday reality.” Like all the exiting miners, he is carrying a great big bag of stuff, boots, bright orange, black-smeared clothes and a Davy lamp, which he pulls out to show me. It’s impossible to believe it serves a practical purpose, it looks like an exhibit from the V&amp;A. “This?” he says indignantly. “It’s incredibly sensitive. The smallest flame it can read is 1.4% of methane. If oxygen falls below 17%, it’ll go out. I think the next time that’ll be lit will be at my funeral.” If you believe in keeping fossil fuels in the ground, you should be pleased, in theory; except that the power plant at Drax in nearby Selby will continue to burn coal – four million tons a year – which it has imported from America and Colombia. Its owners point out that it wasn’t their idea to close down the UK coal industry, blaming “European environmental legislation (the industrials emissions directive) which requires significant cuts in the emissions of things like sulphur and nitrogen oxide. The foreign-sourced coals have fewer of these impurities.” It’s an insight into the unintended consequences of these regulations, that obeying them while continuing to use coal means shipping it huge distances, which does nothing to cut emissions. The NUM’s Poulson simply will not accept that more couldn’t have been done. “If we got the subsidies that nuclear power gets, we could afford to mine this field, give it away free and still make a profit. Is that a level playing field?” Not really, from any angle; and now the game’s over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/southern-crossroads/2014/sep/29/australian-uranium-india-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T12:10:55Z","webTitle":"After Fukushima, is it moral for Australia to sell uranium to India? | Alexander White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2014/sep/29/australian-uranium-india-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2014/sep/29/australian-uranium-india-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"After Fukushima, is it moral for Australia to sell uranium to India?","bodyText":"At the height of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese prime minister Nato Kan was faced with a decision: would he have to order the evacuation of Tokyo. \"Three of the reactors also experienced hydrogen explosions, he said. \"If this situation had exacerbated any further we would have been faced with the situation of having to evacuate Tokyo.\" Kan wrote two years later on the Huffington Post that a worsened situation at Fukushima would \"mean the realization of the worst-case scenario: a situation where 50 million people within a 250-kilometer radius of Fukushima, including Tokyo and its greater metropolitan area, would have to be evacuated.\" The Japanese government was nearly paralysed by the panic over the possibility of large radiation releases, and the government went to significant lengths to hide the true extend of the meltdown from the public, and from their ally the United States, according to a report in the New York Times. Although Tokyo was not evacuated, over 300,000 people from the Fukushima area were; those who remain, as well as emergency workers, are facing extremely high risks of cancer. Kan wrote: Before the Fukushima accident, with the belief that no nuclear accident would happen as long as the safety measures were followed properly, I had pushed the policy of utilizing nuclear power. Having faced the real accident as Prime Minister, and having experienced the situation which came so close to requiring me to order the evacuation of 50 million people, my view is now changed 180 degrees. Although some airplane crashes may claim hundreds of casualties, there are no other events except for wars that would require the evacuation of tens of millions of people. Although the Fukushima disaster seems confined to Japan, the story of this particular nuclear disaster started in a big yellow truck in an Australian uranium mine. One hundred percent of Australian uranium is exported, and our export industry is one of the largest in the world, supplying between 12-20 percent of the global market. We have around 30 percent of the world's reserves of uranium. Prior to the Fukushima disaster, Japan bought around 2,400 tonnes of uranium from Australia, our second largest market next to the European Union. A 2003 Senate inquiry into the Ranger uranium mine found that \"a pattern of under-performance and non-compliance\", with a \"large number of incidents attributable to unsatisfactory management practices and, many have argued, the inadequate monitoring and oversight by regulating authorities.\" This 2003 inquiry was the last significant examination of the Australian uranium industry. More recently in February 2014, Australia faced a uranium contamination scare in New South Wales, after a Santos coal-seam gas well in the Pillaga Forest spilled water contaminated with uranium and arsenic into an aquifer. The details of the spill were not made public until after The Wilderness Society uncovered the spill through freedom of information applications to the Environmental Protection Authority. Santos was fined $1,500 for this spill and has paid $55,000 in fines for at least \"20 toxic coal seam gas waste-water spills\", according to The Wilderness Society's national director Lyndon Schneiders Australia has a moral obligation and a humanitarian responsibility for the hazards posed by the uranium we sell. Even once it leaves our shores, there are many risks that Australians should care about: proliferation, nuclear waste and nuclear disasters could all have catastrophic impacts on Australia and our neighbours. After Fukushima, we cannot return to business-as-usual when it comes to uranium exports. Yet the Australian government not only plans to expand our uranium exports, but has substantially lowered the standards that we once required through the recent deal that was signed with India. For decades, Australia's policy was to only sell uranium to nations which were signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. While this treaty exists primarily to defend the \"nuclear club\" dominated by the USA, Russia and Britain, it is an important treaty to restrict and reduce the number of nuclear weapons. India is not a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, but pressure from the US was brought to bear on Australia to sell our uranium to India. It has at least two large reactors that are \"apparently run as military plutonium producers\". There is no doubt that Australian uranium would free up local Indian reserves to be used for weapons. In 2005, former head of India's global strategic development task force K. Subramaniam wrote in the Times of India: Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our minimum credible deterrent as fast as possible, it is to India's advantage to categorise as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refuelled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapon-grade plutonium production. This sale deal is irresponsible and violates Australia's long-standing position of adhering to international treaties. We should be wary of selling uranium to a nation that will not sign the non-proliferation treaty and refuses to decommission its nuclear weapons. It may not be our uranium in those bombs, but by exporting our uranium to India we are facilitating their military nuclear program and are more generally increasing the risk of proliferation and disaster. David Sweeney is the long-standing nuclear free campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation. He visited Fukushima after the meltdown in 2012. His account is heartbreaking and poignant. A farmer accepts that his current rice crop will be destroyed after harvest because it will be too contaminated. But he hopes next year's might be better. I sit by a pond in his rice paddy as he explains his hope that if the ducks eat enough worms and grubs they might remove the radiation. No one has the heart to contradict him. Beside his house is a cedar tree that is 1,200 years old and his ancestors had the honour of supplying rice to the Shogun feudal lords. The rice from those same fields is now radioactive. He said to me that the Indian uranium deal is \"a retreat from reason and responsibility\". Sweeney sees uranium as the asbestos of the twenty-first century: \"there's no doubt it works – but there's also no doubt its environmental, human and economic cost is high and there are safer and cleaner alternatives.\" Australia did not stop extracting and exporting asbestos because we ran out of the resource, we stopped because the resource ran out of social license and the companies involved in this toxic trade ran out of excuses. The same will happen with the uranium sector. Sweeney and the Australian Conservation Foundation are deeply critical of the Indian uranium deal, arguing that the \"so-called safeguards referred to by the Prime Minister are meaningless\". \"In the shadow of Fukushima – a continuing nuclear crisis directly fuelled by Australian uranium – Mr Abbott has no excuse or mandate to undermine renewable energy at home while pushing long term radioactive risk abroad,\" Sweeney said. The questionable morality of uranium mining is well-known in the USA, where uranium \"booms\" and \"busts\" created an \"epidemic of abandoned mines\" riddled with toxins, radiation and pollution. Freelance writer Tara Lohan explains: Poor or non-existent regulations, including allowing radioactive waste to be dumped into unlined pits, has left a legacy of toxic pollution and poisoned communities in the West, many on tribal and federal lands. (There are 520 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo land alone.) American taxpayers have been stuck with cleanup bills in the billions of dollars. Globally, nuclear energy is facing a structural decline. The Fukushima disaster has added a 10 year delay to the \"anticipated growth\" before the accident, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and has ended talk of a \"nuclear renaissance\". \"There are 388 operating reactors around the world, 50 fewer than in 2002.\" http://t.co/xbPGsTjV1Q — Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) September 29, 2014 Robin Bromby, a columnist with The Australian wrote recently: In all, there are 67 \"current\" nuclear reactor projects, which sounds impressive until the report explains that eight of those reactors have been listed as \"under construction\" for more than 20 years; at least 49 have encountered construction delays, some for several years, and for the first time Chinese projects have also been delayed; for the remaining 18 reactors, either construction began within the past five years or the reactors have not yet reached projected start-up dates. Meanwhile, pro-nuclear energy advocates continue to promote the so-called merits of constructing nuclear power stations in Australia, despite the fact that it is \"not a remarkably cheap option, nor a simple one; 10 or 15 years could be needed before a decision to go nuclear leads to an operating plant\", according to Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox. Nuclear energy is a risky and high cost source of electricity that produces intractable challenges of militarisation, waste and proliferation. With the horror of Fukushima still clearly visible, the morality of exporting Australian uranium to India is on shaky ground indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/2015/oct/28/turkey-election-2015-guide-parties-polls-electoral-system","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-28T13:40:27Z","webTitle":"Turkey election 2015: a guide to the parties, polls and electoral system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/oct/28/turkey-election-2015-guide-parties-polls-electoral-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2015/oct/28/turkey-election-2015-guide-parties-polls-electoral-system","fields":{"headline":"Turkey election 2015: a guide to the parties, polls and electoral system","bodyText":"Background Turkey heads to the polls on Sunday for a snap vote after elections in June proved inconclusive. The AKP of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan failed to win an outright majority for the first time since taking power in 2002. And coalition talks with opposition parties didn’t work out. Since the June election, Turkey has been beset by terror, with a bomb attack targeting a peace rally in Ankara earlier this month leaving more than 100 dead, and a suicide bomber in Suruç, a town near the Syrian border, killing at least 30 people in July. The government is also once again at war with the outlawed Kurdish nationalist PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ party), which has put a break on peace talks that had been underway since 2012. Although it has not played a central role in the campaign, there is also the refugee crisis. With some two million refugees in the country currently, Turkey has been negotiating a deal with the EU in order to receive financial support to secure its borders and sustain the handling of its end of the crisis. Other issues remain a slowing economy – over the past five years, economic growth has fallen from above 10% to 3% and GDP per capita has not grown since 2007 – as well as Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian tendencies and divisiveness, which are still at the forefront of voters’ minds. How does the election work? Turkey’s parliament, the grand national assembly, has 550 seats, 276 of which are needed for a majority. While 367 are needed to change the constitution directly, 330 seats are needed to call a referendum to put any changes to a popular vote. Although it is unlikely, Erdogan still hopes the AKP will win enough seats to amend the constitution and give the role of president more power. Members of the grand national assembly are elected in 85 constituencies through proportional representation. There is a 10% threshold to enter parliament, which is a substantially higher bar compared with other countries. Germany, for example, has a 5% threshold. Sweden’s is set at 4%, while Denmark has a 2% threshold to enter the Folketing. What the Turkish system means is that if a party wins 40 seats but receives only 9.55% of the national vote, as the True Path party (DYP) did in the 2002 elections, it forfeits those 40 seats, which are then reallocated to the parties above the threshold. Simply put, it gives larger parties an obvious advantage. The following interactive shows the difference that a 10% threshold would make on election results in different countries. The main political parties Justice and Development party (AKP) Founded by politicians of various existing conservative parties in 2001, the Islamic conservative Justice and Development party (AKP) has ruled Turkey since it won in landslide elections in 2002. The former foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, became party leader and prime minister after Erdoğan was elected as president of Turkey in a popular vote last year. He also stands as the party’s top candidate on 1 November. Republican People’s party (CHP) Established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, in 1923, the Republican People’s party (CHP) is the oldest party and represents the main opposition. The party leader and its top candidate is Kemal Kiliçdaroğlu. The CHP’s election manifesto in June was centred on economic and labour issues: the party promises to introduce higher pensions, to tackle the current unemployment rate of 11.2%, and to improve employment among young people. It also promises to increase the minimum wage from 950 lira (£235) to 1,500 lira a month, whereas the working week is not to exceed 40 hours. The CHP supports the reform of the current constitution, introduced by the military junta after the 1980 military coup, but opposes the AKP’s plans of an executive presidency. While the party has certainly changed under its current leader, many voters, especially Kurds and the religiously conservative, still distrust the CHP as a dogmatic and elitist party. Nationalist Movement party (MHP) The far-right Nationalist Movement party (MHP), informally known as the Grey Wolves, will likely retain its place as the third largest group in the Turkish parliament. The party is led by Devlet Bahçeli. While the MHP supports a certain degree of Kurdish and minority rights – the party promises in its manifesto that Cemeviler, Alevi houses of worship, will receive state support – they are against the peace process between the government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), arguing that the Kurds need to accept the authority of the Turkish state. They promise to end all ongoing negotiations should they come to power. Therefore the MHP draws its support mainly from a non-Kurdish base and is likely to generate MPs in all major Turkish cities. People’s Democratic party (HDP) Often described as Turkey’s answer to Greece’s Syriza and Spain’s Podemos, this democratic-socialist party stood for the first time as a party in June with promises to drive forward the Kurdish peace process and end ethnic, religious and gender discrimination. With a programme focused on minority rights, the rights of women and LGBTs, it was founded in 2012 and led by chairman Selahattin Demirtaş and chairwoman Figen Yüksekdag. Before winning 80 seats in June, the HDP’s MPs stood as independent candidates since Turkey’s election threshold of 10% only applies to political parties. It is the only political party in Turkey that has a 50% women quota. The HDP describes itself as an environmentalist and anti-capitalist party that opposes nuclear power and vows to improve workers’ rights. What do the polls say? If the polls are right, Sunday’s election result will be largely a repeat of June’s vote. However, the HDP success – or lack thereof – could change the result dramatically. If it can once again pass the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament, that will go a long way to determining the election’s outcome – and if the AKP can win an outright majority. How do I follow on election day? Polls open at 8am and close at 5pm. Results are published throughout the evening as votes are counted. The Guardian will be live blogging the election. You can follow Constanze Letsch, the paper’s Istanbul correspondent, and Kareem Shaheen, our Middle East reporter, on Twitter for updates throughout the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/dec/13/greenest-ever-uk-government-red-faced-over-diesel-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-13T08:02:18Z","webTitle":"Cameron’s ‘greenest-ever’ government should be red-faced on diesel subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/13/greenest-ever-uk-government-red-faced-over-diesel-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/dec/13/greenest-ever-uk-government-red-faced-over-diesel-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Cameron’s ‘greenest-ever’ government should be red-faced on diesel subsidies","bodyText":"Even a successful fiction writer would be unlikely to attempt to pull off an absurd conceit whereby the self-styled “greenest-ever” government hands out subsidies to the most heavily polluting companies just as it prepares to approve a global climate change treaty. And yet last week British ministers did just that as a scheme developed under their electricity market reform programme gave £170m to energy companies so that they could build new diesel generators to run for 15 years. To make matters worse, some of these diesel farms are owned by companies specifically set up by wealthy investors to take advantage of tax breaks through the Enterprise Investment Scheme. And these projects are all submitted on a one-by-one basis so that each falls under a 20 megawatt power threshold – above which they would not be allowed to operate, as they would break EU rules on pollution. Trying to obtain information about or even locate any of these diesel farms is hard. The government says it is up to the National Grid to run the capacity auction and vet the players. The grid, which both organises the auction and – bizarrely – successfully bids into it with its interconnector pipeline network, is coy about the bidders and says it is not empowered to discriminate between fossil fuel or other technologies. The diesel farmers themselves tend to hide behind obscure websites containing little information. One we did pin down said it could not give the locations of its facilities on the grounds that this would be a security risk. The government’s original intention was to hold a series of capacity auctions that would encourage energy firms to bid for financial aid in order to build new, lower carbon and flexible gas-fired power stations to meet peak demand. In fact, companies owning this kind of generating capacity did win half the contracts on offer – but only with existing power stations which would probably have remained operational anyway. A group of nuclear power stations and even coal-fired stations are also all beneficiaries of this generous incentive scheme, which is all paid for through higher bills for the hapless consumer. Something did have to be done. Britain’s energy system is at breaking point, as was clear at the start of last month, when the National Grid was forced to use emergency powers to keep the lights on. The country used to have spare capacity of around 20% which could be called on in the event of power station breakdowns – like the ones that happened in November – or in a winter cold snap when power demand soared. But those spare margins have been falling fast and energy regulator Ofgem warned that next summer they could fall to zero as more old coal and nuclear plants are retired. And yet there is no unforeseen event that triggered this lamentable situation. Climate change is not new – neither is ageing plant or deregulation of the energy sector over the past 25 years, which has helped encourage the wipeout of what was deemed in the City to be “inefficient” excess capacity. The government says diesel farms will run for very short periods and only make up a small part of the generating story. The auction scheme, it insists, ultimately provides energy security and value for money. But relying on climate burning and super-expensive diesel farms as a stop-gap is a symbol of failure at a time when the UK is rightly committing itself to lower carbon emissions at the UN climate talks in Paris. It is particularly grim given that the diesel revolution is accompanied by other anomalies such as huge subsidies being paid to foreign state companies to build the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. In addition, investment has been chased away from the cheapest form of renewable energy, onshore wind, while the government has slashed solar subsidies. Ministers have cut insulation and energy efficiency grants and failed to put their weight behind a sector that should be top of everyone’s agenda: demand reduction. Solving our energy problems does not involve science fiction, but it does require consistency, joined-up thinking and resolve. Too much information At 7am each weekday, companies listed on the London Stock Exchange issue their news to investors. They can contain the unexpected – a notice headed “change of directorship” can reveal a huge boardroom bust-up – but mainly the statements are timetabled financial information, many of them three-monthly updates. On Friday, though, came a sign that the 7am dump could be about to change: Legal &amp; General announced it would no longer publish results on a quarterly cycle. The insurer is not the first big firm to take such a step: United Utilities, Diageo and National Grid were first to move. But its decision is significant because it is not only a market-listed insurance company but also a major investor in all the companies listed on the market. It is the clearest signal yet that quarterly reporting, introduced via an EU directive in 2007, is no longer a necessity. For a while it served its purpose: quarterly updates by banks during the crisis became more detailed as their bosses tried to demonstrate they were not hiding bad news. But as John Kay – appointed by Vince Cable to look at the reasons behind short-termist investing – pointed out in 2012, it has become something of a tyranny. The quality of the information disclosed often feels less important than the length of the statements being issued. L&amp;G is careful to point out that it must be up to each company to decide whether to carry on with the practice (the rules were changed last year). It should also be flexible. For mining companies, for instance, it might be counterproductive to start releasing financial information less regularly during the current commodities rout. But in more normal times there should be an opportunity to put an end to the quarterly tyranny. Some respite from the quarterly chore may finally be coming for companies that have to spend too much management time preparing and delivering the updates – and for investors and analysts. Sports Direct needs surgery Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct has always had a tricky relationship with the City. But the retailer – which was last week at the centre of a Guardian investigation revealing how workers are subjected to a regime of searches and surveillance, with thousands of them receiving hourly rates of pay that are effectively below the minimum wage – has survived, endorsed by a group of gold-plated advisers, headed by its joint broker, Goldman Sachs. Goldman, whose London co-head Michael Sherwood is close to Ashley, has helped the billionaire get through some difficult governance issues in the past, including four attempts to push through a £73m bonus for their client. Now Goldman and Sherwood must look again. When the director general of the Institute of Directors, no less, describes Sports Direct as “a scar” on British business, it is time for the company’s advisers to take stock.

Asked by senators on the armed services committee during his confirmation hearing about the greatest threat facing the US, Dunford replied: “My assessment today is that Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security.” When Romney offered the same contention in 2012, Obama mocked him, saying in a presidential debate: “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the cold war’s been over for 20 years.” Dunford, a former commander of the Afghanistan war, argued that Russia’s status as a nuclear power and its irredentism in Ukraine rendered it the pre-eminent challenge to US security. Asked to rank the next greatest threats, Dunford listed China and North Korea before the Islamic State. But Dunford clarified that his inclusion of China was a function of US interests in the Pacific and China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities. “It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re a current threat or that we view them as an enemy,” Dunford said. Dunford also denied that he would “attack those issues in sequence”, signalling instead he would focus on them all during his term as chairman. Dunford, who is highly likely to be confirmed, indicated that he wished to study the US effort against Isis more closely. But he said he could imagine Iraq unravelling into Sunni and Shia-Kurdish rump states. “I can imagine two states in Iraq,” Dunford said. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is the president’s senior military adviser. While the chairman is not in the chain of military command, the general or admiral who fills the position exerts enormous influence over US defense priorities. Chairmen always style themselves as apolitical even as they navigate the thorny and unavoidable politics of the military and its interactions with the White House and Congress. While leading the war effort in Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014, Dunford successfully prevailed upon Obama to slow down the White House’s long-announced troop withdrawal, a move the Senate committee urged Dunford to intensify now Isis has a presence in the country. Dunford, while not repudiating the president he will serve, signalled his assent, saying his advice to Obama would “be based on the conditions on the ground”, rather than a timetable he said was “probably affected by the political events inside Afghanistan” and “the enemy”. The general also signalled agreement with a key priority of John McCain, the other Republican Obama beat for the presidency. Dunford said he would be open to extending US military protection to the handful of Syrian militants the US is training to fight Isis should they come under attack by President Bashar al-Assad, their primary enemy. McCain argues that the US will never be able to convince Syrian rebels to fight Isis on its behalf unless it aids them in overthrowing Assad, which the Obama administration considers a recipe for enmeshing the US in the Middle East’s most gruelling and complex civil war. Dunford has cultivated McCain, who has an acrimonious relationship with the current chairman of the joint chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, and who chairs the Senate committee critical for approving Dunford’s nomination. Three days after Obama announced in May that Dunford was his choice to replace the retiring Dempsey, Dunford honored McCain with an evening parade at the marine corps barracks in south-east Washington. In Thursday’s hearing, Dunford also signalled support for Obama’s stalled “rebalance” or “pivot” to the Pacific. “It’s absolutely critical that we do that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/14/nuclear-power-european-commission-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-14T21:07:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power plans threatened by European commission investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/14/nuclear-power-european-commission-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/14/nuclear-power-european-commission-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power plans threatened by European commission investigation","bodyText":"Britain's planned nuclear reactor programme could be delayed for years, and the nation's long-term energy policy thrown into turmoil, as European commission officials launch the first stage of a formal investigation into the use of taxpayer subsidies to support the development. Sources in Brussels have indicated that Britain hopes to win approval for a multibillion-pound deal with French energy giant EDF at the initial stage, which usually takes two months. But if after a preliminary investigation the EC's competition directorate decides to launch a full-scale investigation, that would last at least 18 months and probably two years or more. Such an outcome is made more likely by reports that ministers and EDF are discussing a minimum or \"strike\" price for the nuclear-generated electricity of a little under £100 per megawatt hour – nearly double the current market rate. However ministers will be hoping that their regular meetings with EC officials will make it more likely that a full inquiry will be avoided. Under the proposals, a nuclear power station – the first for a generation – will be built at Hinkley in Somerset, and the government will guarantee a minimum price for the electricity produced for 30-40 years, a deal which could cost customers a billion pounds a year or more. News of the latest obstacle to the nuclear building programme comes before the expected announcement next week by the energy secretary, Ed Davey, of whether EDF has won planning permission for the 3.2 gigawatt Hinkley nuclear plant. He is widely expected to give the scheme the go-ahead. Expectations are rising that Davey could also announce some details of the new contract, including the strike price, in what would be a useful counter to critics that the coalition is not doing enough to stimulate investment to boost the economy and tackle the UK's threatened energy shortages. A delay imposed by Brussels would cast new doubt on the £14bn project as it would be likely to make it harder for EDF to raise the capital needed until its contract with the government was fully approved. That in turn would delay the entire nuclear build programme, under which the government wanted 16 gigawatts of new nuclear power operating by the middle of the next decade. \"The government wouldn't need state aid approval for nuclear if it wasn't trying to subsidise a risky technology that could wind up costing more than the renewable alternative,\" said Doug Parr, policy director for the anti-nuclear campaign group Greenpeace. Maria Madrid, spokeswoman for Joaquín Almunia of Spain, the European commission vice-president in charge of competition, told the Guardian: \"The commission is in contact with the UK authorities on this issue, but has not received a formal notification so far. We are discussing this issue. It's confidential. We never communicate on preliminary discussions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/19/revealed-many-more-solar-firms-face-closure-if-government-cuts-go-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T09:35:02Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Many more solar firms face closure if government cuts go ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/revealed-many-more-solar-firms-face-closure-if-government-cuts-go-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/19/revealed-many-more-solar-firms-face-closure-if-government-cuts-go-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Many more solar firms face closure if government cuts go ahead","bodyText":"Hundreds more jobs will be lost at solar power companies if planned changes to government policy come into force in the new year, 25 small businesses have told the Guardian. The solar and energy efficiency companies have already made 32 staff redundant between them and more than a dozen of the firms said they expect to close if the changes come to pass as expected, with the total loss of more than 350 jobs. The losses would be in addition to 1,000 jobs that have already been axed after four solar power companies in the past fortnight announced they were going into liquidation, blaming the government cuts to support for solar. Unions also joined the criticism on Monday, saying the government should not have “slashed” subsidies. The businesses the Guardian spoke to accused the government of “actively destroying UK renewables” and “stopping an industry in its tracks”. Most specifically referred to a proposed 87% cut to the solar feed-in tariff, a government incentive scheme for small solar installations. Some firms also cited the closure of support for the flagship “green deal” scheme that incentivised homeowners to invest in insulation for their homes. Many reported that they are experiencing a surge in demand before the change to the feed-in tariffs comes into force on 1 January 2016. The Renewable Obligation (RO) scheme, a separate solar subsidy for larger solar installations of up to five megawatts, is also set for early closure in April. Nick Pascoe, managing director at Orta Solar, which is in the process of closing, making four permanent staff redundant and affecting 11 more contractors, told the Guardian: “The rest of the world has recognised that renewable electricity inspires countless entrepreneurs to set up localised generation businesses and that it can challenge the market share of the established monopolies. “However, this government are so much in the pockets of those established monopolies that they are doing their bidding in actively destroying UK renewables. Their stance is out of step with the rest of the industrialised world and is a dreadful blight on the UK.” The director of another failing solar company accused the government of “willfull destruction” of the industry in order to make way for fracking and nuclear energy. Ashley Seager, director of Sun4Net, said that the combined impact of the cuts to the feed-in tariff and the RO scheme have made it impossible for the company to stay afloat: “The UK has completely turned its back on renewable energy; the sector is falling apart. The potential revenues of any future project have collapsed. You could only build a solar project at a loss and nobody is going to do that,” he said. “This is willful destruction of the sector by the government so they can support nuclear and fracking, the costs of which are going up.” On Monday, the UN’s top environment scientist told BBC News it was disappointing that the UK government was withdrawing renewable energy support and “enhancing” the fossil fuel industry. The government is set to go “all out” for shale gas in the UK and opened up 1,000 sq miles largely in Yorkshire, the north-west and the Midlands for fracking licenses in August. Chancellor George Osbourne recently used a trip to China to secure support for Hinkley Point C, the UK’s first nuclear power plant in a generation, which is expected to cost £24.5bn and will be heavily subsidised by the government. The employee of another small family-owned solar business at risk, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: “The business that my family have worked so hard to build is now facing some very tough times ahead. It seems to be such a shame that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) are stopping an industry in its tracks. Surely their priority should be clean energy and climate change?” Energy experts have warned that the changes could spell the end of the solar industry in the UK. A consultation on the changes closes on 23 October. Launching a report on the ‘green economy’ on Monday with Greenpeace, the TUC’s general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The UK has the potential to be a world leader in low-carbon manufacturing. But this won’t be achieved by slashing support for renewable energy. Ministers should be learning from the likes of Germany, and getting behind the green economy. This is the way to create the high-quality jobs and apprenticeships we need to boost productivity.” Since returning to power in May, the government have introduced a raft of policy changes to the renewable energy sector, including the early cancellation of wind and solar subsidies. Energy secretary, Amber Rudd, defended the cuts, saying she had to control costs for consumers and arguing solar power still had a future in the UK. Internationally, the government is speaking a different language, with the Department for International Development announcing the start of an “energy revolution” across Africa. During a visit to Nigeria on Wednesday, minister for international development, Grant Shapps, called international support to drive the deployment of solar projects. Other firms told the Guardian they are ending their UK contracts and will survive by expanding their business on the international market. But some said that the industry should have become accustomed to policy changes and that firms will manage by diversifying their services. Simon Taylor, a managing partner at solar installation firm MyPower UK said: “Our business has grown slowly and organically since 2010 and [we] have been wary of growing too quickly purely because of the fact the solar business has been so vulnerable to the changing whims of government ministers. “Solar will only really thrive long term in the UK once government is out of the picture and we can make long-term plans without an ever-changing set of incentives being placed in front of customers. The tariff cuts are necessary but certainly too sudden. The market will shrink in the first half of next year but the long-term prospects will be better for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/23/europe-china-beijing-european-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-23T19:16:12Z","webTitle":"The best lesson China could teach Europe: how to play the long game | Natalie Nougayrède","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/europe-china-beijing-european-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/europe-china-beijing-european-nations","fields":{"headline":"The best lesson China could teach Europe: how to play the long game","bodyText":"Will Britain, if it decides to leave the European Union, one day become the 24th province of the People’s Republic of China? This joke, which I heard from a (non-British) European businessman working in China, points to how perceptions have been shaken up by the pomp and the language surrounding President Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK. It also says a lot about how China is seen to be playing a long, patient and strategic game, while western politicians seem so much more focused on immediate point-scoring and short-term gains. Building a relationship with a rising China is no doubt one of the main challenges the west faces. The nation’s role is growing and will affect the world’s economy and security. All of this presents well-known dilemmas for Europeans, such as how to balance human rights and economic interests. Some of the criticism levelled at David Cameron for keeping silent, in public, on democratic values in order to please the visiting Chinese “emperor” was reminiscent of many other occasions when European governments have become mute in the face of Chinese authoritarianism. Remember how, in 2010, Europeans hesitated to send high-level representatives to the ceremony for the Nobel peace prize awarded to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo? The regime had warned of “consequences”. It’s easy to point out how western moods have swung in dealing with China. In 2008, France’s President Sarkozy threatened to boycott the Beijing Olympic Games over Tibet, only to kowtow shortly afterwards with a declaration promising never to meddle with China’s “sovereignty” again. Much of this had to do with managing public opinion in France, which had been shocked by an outbreak of violent repression in Tibet – but eventually, business interests were prioritised. Angela Merkel, who is generally described as more steadfast in bringing up individual freedoms when talking to despotic leaders, experienced a year-long bad patch in German-Chinese relations after she met the exiled Dalai Lama in 2007. Following that, her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, bent over backwards in his efforts to make amends. China deploys a long-term strategy in part because it has a very long memory, and in part because its ruling elite needn’t bother too much about electoral constraints. China remembers its 19th-century humiliations, when quasi-colonial terms were imposed on it after the Opium wars. It’s not surprising that, while Xi Jinping was in London, a Chinese analyst referred (with a touch of irony) to how “China’s door was opened up by Britain in 1840”. China is out to restore the prestige it lost 175 years ago. More recent memories are also at work, and occasionally hinted at. In 2011, at a White House state dinner for the then Chinese president, Hu Jintao, a Chinese pianist played a song from a Maoist propaganda movie about the 1950s Korean war. China’s long game means it is set to spend billions on building a “new silk road” across Asia to Europe as part of a far-ranging diplomatic and economic offensive. In a nutshell, it is preparing for a “post-western” world. One stated Chinese goal is to have the road up and running by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic. While western politicians have their eye on opinion polls, media coverage and the next campaign, Chinese rulers can safely assume they will be in power for a long stretch – that is, until factions within the Central Committee or the Politburo decide who will be next. Preserving the central role of the party is paramount. In 2011, after the Arab Spring revolutions, China sent emissaries to northern Africa to learn from the mistakes the region’s dictators had made. Apparently the emissaries came back relieved, convinced that China would never be vulnerable to such upheavals because, unlike the Arab dictators, its presidents are replaced every 10 years or so. This is not to say China’s power structure is never inept or over-assertive. It certainly can miscalculate. Relations with the US follow an irregular pattern, depending on circumstances. China at one point began speaking less aggressively over its territorial claims in the South China Sea because it saw this was driving neighbouring countries closer to the US, not further away. The key point is that Europeans must think more strategically in their dealings with China. For all the talk about “win-win” situations, when separate national agreements are made with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) or on nuclear power stations, European states’ disorderly moves hand China easy opportunities to play divide and rule. This week, at a discussion organised in Brussels by the Friends of Europe thinktank, questions were asked about how Europe could “recover global influence in this ‘Asian century’”. One participant pointed out it was crucial to think ahead confidently, and not be panicked. The EU is currently forging a new “strategic agenda” about its place in the world, due to be finalised in 2016 and meant to replace an outdated 2003 document. China can rightly point out that it was already a civilisation 4,000 years ago – well ahead of Europe – and it uses that historical depth to indicate it will never take lessons on democracy. But as China reaches out to European states in a highly selective manner, offering “special partnerships” here and there, it is now time to forge a common European approach that might both embrace and channel China’s drive. Moreover, speaking with one voice on trade can and must be combined with speaking with one voice on values. Chinese money is attractive, but the EU, as the largest single market in the world, is also highly attractive to China. That should be smartly leveraged, not squandered in a desperate race for separate preferential deals that in the end weaken European positions. Europe no doubt faces many urgent problems, some of which have to do with its collective difficulty in anticipating important developments. Yet China is one area where there is still time to get it right. China should be central to the EU’s strategic thinking. Europe should play the long game, like Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/04/from-liquid-air-to-supercapacitators-energy-storage-is-finally-poised-for-a-breakthrough","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-04T00:07:30Z","webTitle":"From liquid air to supercapacitors, energy storage is finally poised for a breakthrough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/from-liquid-air-to-supercapacitators-energy-storage-is-finally-poised-for-a-breakthrough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/04/from-liquid-air-to-supercapacitators-energy-storage-is-finally-poised-for-a-breakthrough","fields":{"headline":"From liquid air to supercapacitors, energy storage is finally poised for a breakthrough","bodyText":"“It doesn’t always rain when you need water, so we have reservoirs - but we don’t have the same system for electricity,” says Jill Cainey, director of the UK’s Electricity Storage Network. But that may change in 2016, with industry figures predicting a breakthrough year for a technology not only seen as vital to the large-scale rollout of renewable energy, but also offering the prospect of lowering customers’ energy bills. Big batteries, whose costs are plunging, are leading the way. But a host of other technologies, from existing schemes like splitting water to create hydrogen, compressing air in underground caverns, flywheels and heated gravel pits, to longer term bets like supercapacitors and superconducting magnets, are also jostling for position. In the UK, the first plant to store electricity by squashing air into a liquid is due to open in March, while the first steps have been taken towards a virtual power station comprised of a network of home batteries. “We think this will be a breakthrough year,” says John Prendergast at RES, a UK company that has 80MW of lithium-ion battery storage operational across the world and six times more in development, including its first UK project at a solar park near Glastonbury. “All this only works if it reduces costs for consumers and we think it does,” he says. Energy storage is important for renewable energy not because green power is unpredictable - the sun, wind and tides are far more predictable than the surge that follows the end of a Wimbledon tennis final or the emergency shutdown of a gas-fired power plant. Storage is important because renewable energy is intermittent: strong winds in the early hours do not coincide with the peak demand of evenings. Storage allows electricity to be time-shifted to when it is needed, maximising the benefits of windfarms and solar arrays. This alone would not be enough to justify the costs of storage, but it brings multiple other advantages. The UK’s National Grid already spends £1bn a year on balancing the grid, switching power on or off to keep the lights on, and stored energy could play a big role. Storage can also be a much cheaper option than big new power stations that might be paid to lie idle for much of the year and only kick in on cold winter evenings. The widely distributed nature of storage also boosts energy security. “It’s a ‘no regrets’ option,” says Prendergast. The most established form of energy storage is pumping water up mountains, and the UK has four such plants. But available mountains in useful places are now rare and Highview Power Storage is about to fire up an alternative: liquid air. Its new £8m demonstration plant, at Pilsworth, near Manchester, and funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), is set to start in March. By compressing air 700 times into a cold liquid, it stores power which is released by evaporating the liquid air into a high pressure gas to turn a turbine. The 5MW system will be able to power many thousands of homes for a few hours. Gareth Brett, CEO of Highview, says it is like pumped storage, but can be sited wherever it is needed. Another technology backed by Decc is a home battery system from Moixa Group, a UK technology similar to Tesla’s Powerwall. The £2,000 briefcase-sized battery can store surplus energy from rooftop solar panels but it also earns money by being part of a smart network of home batteries - a virtual power station - which the company uses to help balance the National Grid. “You can turn houses on or off the grid, if the National Grid wants me to do it and pays me to do it,” says Simon Daniel, Moixa founder and CEO. About 350 systems have been installed so far, and Daniel argues that rolling out a much bigger network could be much faster than waiting for planning permission for large energy storage sites. “Sky installed satellite dishes in a third of UK homes in seven years,” Daniel says. He also jokes his battery “is currently manufactured in [energy secretary] Amber Rudd’s constituency, which is good politically.” The Moixa system uses lithium-ion batteries and these are the mainstay of the current grid-scale energy storage rollout around the world. In the past they were considered too expensive for larger scale storage but costs continue to fall and their proven track record in consumer electronics gives investors confidence. The UK’s biggest operating energy storage system is an £18m battery plant installed by UK Power Networks (UKPN) at Leighton Buzzard, a growing Bedfordshire town. UKPN’s Martin Wilcox says the company, responsible for delivering electricity to homes in south-east England, had a choice: build a third main power line into the town from the National Grid or install 6MW of batteries. With the money it earns by balancing the grid, the latter looked cheaper and went live in 2015. The UKPN project is set to be overtaken by AES, a global power company, with a 10MW lithium-ion plant at its Kilroot power station in Northern Ireland, while REDT is installing a £3.6m flow battery on the Scottish island of Gigha, to support its wind turbines. Batteries are also at the heart of the Everest project in East Anglia, but it uses second-hand batteries from Renault electric cars. Ian McDonald, at Future Transport Systems, which is the technical lead for the project, says it buys the batteries - at a fraction of the new cost - after they are about 75% degraded by the “use and abuse” of normal stop-start driving. Because the batteries are then only charged and discharged slowly, as part of an electric car recharging network, they get another five to six years of life. Using electric car batteries as a smart storage network while still in the cars is a promising option in the future, according to Mark Thompson at Innovate UK, a government agency. He says there could be 4GW capacity - a nuclear power station is about 1GW - by 2025 across the 300,000 electric cars projected to be on UK roads by then. He says cars are stationary for 95% of the time and using them could save billions of pounds, removing the need for new power stations and power lines. But while interest in energy storage projects in the UK is surging - a recent call from National Grid for 200MW of short-term storage was oversubscribed six times - it is starting from a low base: just 24MW has been installed compared to the 5,000MW the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, envisages in a low-carbon nation in 2030. “The UK and Europe really led the way on renewables, with the US following. But the opposite seems to be the case in the energy storage industry,” says Audrey Fogarty, at Younicos, a German energy storage company with major operations in US. California alone has mandated 1,200MW of storage by 2020. Sally Fenton, at Decc, said the government was still deciding how to deploy the £250m it now has for non-nuclear energy innovation, but said: “We certainly expect to have increased funding” for energy storage. In November, energy secretary Rudd said: “Locally generated energy supported by storage, interconnection and demand response, offers the possibility of a radically different model ... We are looking at removing regulations that are holding back smart solutions, such as demand side response and storage.” That would be welcomed by UKPN’s Wilcox: “Storage is absolutely at a tipping point. But [energy] regulation was designed 10-20 years ago for a different system.” For example, he says, UKPN has to pay towards government social and green subsides when it buys electricity to charge its batteries, but then customers pay them again when they take the power from the discharging battery. Brett, at Highview, praises Decc for its support - “they have really stuck with us as a British technology” - but says regulatory issues are having a “chilling effect” on the rollout of storage. Cainey, director of the trade body Electricity Storage Network, says storage projects can be built very quickly. “A battery project can take 12-18 months from saying we will do it, to completion.” She said California’s high ambition came from its commitment to tackling climate change: “California is aggressively pursuing a low-carbon agenda and they don’t want diesel [generator back-up] on the system.” The UK government has been criticised for recently awarding £175m of subsidy to highly polluting diesel generator farms. “Amber Rudd is talking a lot about energy storage, but we need a clear regulatory steer,” says Cainey. “The planes are circling, but there is no runway to land on.” Prof Ian Arbon, at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, which in 2014 called energy storage the “missing link” in the UK’s energy plans, is even more direct: “As a nation we are nowhere near where we should be on energy storage. There is a clear need for massive and urgent attention. Energy storage is one of the obvious solutions to the [decarbonisation] problems we face.” The government is keen to build new gas-fired power stations and develop fracking, but Arbon said: “The UK is the only country in the world who thinks it is going to hit its renewable targets by doing more fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/19/edf-accused-dungeness-nuclear-shutdown-energy-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-19T13:49:43Z","webTitle":"EDF 'withheld information about Dungeness nuclear shutdown'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/19/edf-accused-dungeness-nuclear-shutdown-energy-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/19/edf-accused-dungeness-nuclear-shutdown-energy-reactors","fields":{"headline":"EDF 'withheld information about Dungeness nuclear shutdown'","bodyText":"EDF has failed to be open and transparent by shutting down its Dungeness plant in Kent for two months without properly informing people, environmentalists have said. The energy company put a one-line statement on its website in May last year saying unit 22 at Dungeness station had been taken offline on 20 May for maintenance work that included completing improvements to flood defences for extreme events. Yet five months earlier, EDF had privately admitted to the industry's watchdog, the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR), that the shingle bank between the reactors and the sea was \"not as robust as previously thought\", according to the environmental website ClickGreen. A review of flood defences followed the Fukushima disaster in Japan, which raised global concerns about the vulnerability of atomic power stations in coastal areas. British environmentalists have long warned that rising sea levels owing to global warming represent a threat to power stations including Sizewell, off the coast of Suffolk. The UK nuclear sector, born in the days of the cold war, has a reputation for secrecy. It had promised to be more open in future, but EDF put out a more detailed statement on what it had been doing in Kent only on Wednesday, after media reports on the shutdown. It went on to quote Martin Pearson, station director at Dungeness B, as insisting that all was well: \"The power station has operated normally in the recent high tides and stormy weather.\" Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace, said it was deeply worrying that the French company, which wants to build a new power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, \"does not feel the need to tell the wider community about serious safety worries over flooding\". The nuclear industry often boasts that it provides almost permanent electricity, unlike many renewables, which function only when the wind blows or the sun shines. But the older UK plants have often been regularly offline because of sustained need for maintenance or breakdowns. At Oskarshamn, in south-east Sweden, one of the world's largest nuclear reactors shut down five months ago after jellyfish clogged up pipes that bring cool water into the plant's turbines. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, predicted that as the impact of climate change took effect, Britain would see more incidents of extreme weather, with nuclear power stations along the UK's coastline facing increasing dangers of flooding.

The unnamed man, who was diagnosed with leukaemia in January 2014 after feeling unwell, spent a year working on reactor buildings that were badly damaged after a magnitude 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck Fukushima and other parts of Japan’s north-east coast on 11 March 2011. The disaster caused a triple meltdown at the nuclear plant, where so far almost 45,000 workers have been involved in a cleanup and decommissioning effort that is expected to cost billions of dollars and take about 40 years. Tuesday’s announcement by Japan’s health ministry will come as a blow to Fukushima’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), and could frustrate government efforts to encourage people to return to communities nearby that have been declared safe. Media reports said the man, an employee of one of the myriad contractors employed by Tepco, helped install covers on two damaged reactor buildings between October 2012 and December 2013. He was diagnosed with leukaemia while still in his 30s. A health ministry official said the man had worn protective gear while at the plant and would be awarded compensation to cover medical costs and lost income. “While the causal link between his exposure to radiation and his illness is unclear, we certified him from the standpoint of worker compensation,” the official said. Three other plant workers suffering from cancer are awaiting confirmation that their illnesses are linked to the accident, which sent large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents, most of whom are still unable to return to their homes. Tepco said it could not comment on the decision to approve the worker’s compensation claim. “We would like to offer our condolences to the worker,” a Tepco spokesman said. “We will continue to reduce the radiation dose of the working environment and manage thoroughly workers’ exposure to radiation.” Before his diagnosis the man had been exposed to 16 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation at Fukushima and a further 4 mSv during three months he spent at another nuclear plant in 2012. Compensation insurance is awarded to workers after exposure to 5 mSv in a year, according to the ministry. According to Tepco, 21,000 of the 45,000 people who have worked at Fukushima since the disaster were exposed to more than 5 mSv of radiation between March 2011 and the end of July this year. More than 9,000 have received a dose of at least 20 mSv, and six have been exposed to more than 250 mSv. “A dose of 100 mSv per annum is very high, and 250 mSv would be unconscionable,” said Dr Ian Fairlie, an independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment. “Clearly what is happening at Fukushima Daiichi is that thousands of temporary workers are being exposed to high radiation levels, then dismissed when their dosimeters reach the limit.” The man’s exposure to relatively low amounts of radiation – lower, even, than those deemed safe enough for residents to return to their homes – could prompt a rethink of the government’s push to promote the resettlement of displaced Fukushima evacuees. Experts are divided on whether low doses of radiation, below a threshold of 100 mSv, can be linked to cancer. “This is a landmark decision from the viewpoint of workers’ rights, and it’s probably just the tip of the iceberg,” Shinzo Kimura, associate professor of radiation and hygiene at Dokkyo Medical University, told Agence France-Presse. He said the decision to recognise the man’s cancer as radiation-related, despite his relatively low dose, was “an alarm bell” for the government. Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College London, said she was surprised by the health ministry’s decision to recognise the diagnosis as linked to radiation exposure while working at Fukushima. “Given the low doses that the workers were exposed to, the increased risk is very small at these doses, and it would be very difficult to be certain that this was due to radiation and not to other factors that cause leukaemia,” Thomas said. “At these doses, the other factors are a more likely cause of the man’s illness.” Anti-nuclear campaigners said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Japanese authorities had been premature in saying there would be no discernible impact on health from the disaster. “This is a massive blow to the IAEA, which stated in September of this year that no discernible health effects due to the exposure to radiation released by the accident are to be expected,” Greenpeace Japan said. Jan Vande Putte, a radiation expert with Greenpeace Belgium, said: “The statement from the IAEA that there would be no discernible health effects from the Fukushima disaster was clearly premature. “The impacts both from the initial releases and from the ongoing nuclear crisis have yet to be fully seen, as the historical example of Chernobyl demonstrates. Greenpeace calls on the IAEA and the Japanese authorities to retract their unsubstantiated and unscientific statement. The workers on-site and the citizens of Fukushima are suffering from the consequences of this nuclear disaster. Denying this reality is both dismissive of their suffering and undermines their fight for justice for themselves and their families.” There has been a significant spike in the rate of thyroid cancer among children and young people living in Fukushima at the time of the accident, but local medical authorities claim the increase is owing to the use of sensitive equipment and the unusually large number of people being tested, and is not the result of radiation exposure. That claim was challenged recently by Toshihide Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University, whose study found that cases of thyroid cancer among Fukushima children are 20 to 50 times higher than among children elsewhere in Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/27/labour-party-90s-corbyn-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-27T12:14:08Z","webTitle":"Come on, Labour, get over the 90s and join in Jeremy Corbyn’s debate | Tristram Hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/27/labour-party-90s-corbyn-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/27/labour-party-90s-corbyn-debate","fields":{"headline":"Come on, Labour, get over the 90s and join in Jeremy Corbyn’s debate","bodyText":"“The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” So said Antonio Gramsci. And there are few more obvious signs of political morbidity than the collapse, intellectual as well as organisational, of those moderate sections of the Labour party that did not back Jeremy Corbyn. His victory was both remarkable and total. So now, every member has a duty to engage with the Corbyn-led debate about the future of the left and his rethink of our political method. As Peter Mandelson’s memo put it, the old labels and past fights need to be forgotten. Because last week the awful consequences of our failure to renew was made plain when the Tories rammed through savage cuts to tax credits alongside an ugly assault on trade union rights. First of all, we need to accept that the old ways are dying. The command-and-control, disciplinarian message of 1990s political management is incompatible with the coming age of individualism and authenticity. More than that, part of the attractiveness of the Corbyn campaign was the perception that an open conversation was central to his politics. This tapped into the same raw hostility towards the closed political habits of a technocratic elite that has emboldened so much European populism on both left and right. For Podemos in Spain or the Five Star Movement in Italy, the pluralism of the movement has been a vital recruiting tool. All of which means that the messy, open, often contradictory process of Labour party democracy can no longer be regarded as an unwelcome impediment to pure policy delivery. Discussion of politics and development of policy need to become one and the same. Social media also played a large part in Corbyn’s victory. And here the virtues are more circumspect. Because at a time of weakening ideological ties among much of the public, Twitter and Facebook increasingly intensify tribal sentiment among the already convinced. This is a new landscape of algorithm politics: Google’s skill at offering you what it knows you like is now directing you towards what you want to hear, from people like you. But, as we found to our cost at the general election, the social media echo chamber doesn’t always win you actual votes in ballot boxes. The truth is, some traditional values – leadership and policy – still matter. But once again we need to move on from the 1990s. Just as the modern Labour party rarely seeks to revive the political solutions of James Callaghan and Harold Wilson, we also have to move on from the Blair and Brown prescriptions. More than ever, the party needs to reconcile itself with the achievements and flaws of that great Labour government. Then, finally, we can stop obsessing about Blair and his legacy. Not least because the social and economic context has changed so dramatically. Globalisation and the digital revolution have upended the world of work. Five million workers are now self-employed. The relationship between productivity and wages has been severed, with miserable consequences for household income. Only 8% of under-25s belong to a trade union – and the vast majority of those are in the public sector. Above all, the identity politics of nationhood and belonging, Englishness and Scottishness, has completely transformed our political culture. For the Labour party to remain relevant and electable requires a new politics of patriotism, alongside a political economy up to the job of tackling inequality. This cannot be a miserabilist rant about the state of contemporary Britain. It needs to have, as Eric Hobsbawm used to say, ‘the future in its bones’: a socialism that embraces technology and modernity and sees the function of the state as supporting and empowering citizens in an age of insecurity. The quickening pace of globalisation, changes to the labour market, the rise of robots and supercomputers, and the urgent need for social security reform are here to stay. And we need credible answers, which embody our values, to all these challenges. Despite some reservations about Jeremy Corbyn’s policies, I am convinced there is room for greater intellectual convergence across the party. Progressives never bought into the so-called Washington consensus of neoliberal economics. But given the chronic wage stagnation and falling living standards for so many people, we now need to be much more forthright about the limits and failures of markets. Across time and place, capitalism takes on multiple forms, and Labour has now to lead the thinking on what forms of corporate governance, finance and ownership are fit for the digital age. When the British chancellor flies to Beijing to offer government securities to Chinese investors to support the French state in building a UK nuclear power station, our economic model is bust. On housing, asset inflation, pension and mortgage policies for the self-employed, land tax rates and even basic income guarantees, there are radical options to explore. But what we also found out at the general election is that even if Labour is asking the right questions – about inequality, labour market reform, the squeezed middle – we will not be trusted to deliver the answers if we fail to convince on the economy, welfare and immigration. To be radical, you first need to be credible. If the Labour party doesn’t rid itself of its morbid symptoms and start to convince the public it is interested in government, then we could see something else Gramsci was familiar with: the grisly spectre of Conservative hegemony. And it will be the trade union members and working poor who will suffer most."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-key-points","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T15:40:30Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal: the key points","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-key-points","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-key-points","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal: the key points","bodyText":"At its core, the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for escape from the forest of sanctions that has grown up around its economy over the last decade. In addition, Iran would have to accept extensive monitoring and cooperate with an inquiry looking into evidence of past work on nuclear warhead design. These are the main points of the agreement: Uranium enrichment capacity Iran’s current capacity of 19,000 gas centrifuges would be reduced by more than two-thirds to 6,104, out of which just over 5,000 would actually be enriching uranium. All of them would be first-generation centrifuges based on technology going back to the 1950s. Furthermore, for the first 15 years of the deal Iran would not enrich beyond the level of 3.67% purity, low-enriched uranium (LEU) of the kind used in nuclear power stations. Fordow underground enrichment plant This cavern under a mountain near the city of Qom first came to light in 2009. Under the agreement, it would be used only for non-military research. Two-thirds of its centrifuges would be removed and the remainder would not be allowed to enrich uranium. No fissile material would be allowed at the site. These restrictions would apply for 15 years. The enriched uranium stockpile Iran’s stockpile of LEU would be reduced from its current level of about 7,500kg to 300kg, a reduction of 96%. The reduction would be achieved either by shipping the uranium abroad or by diluting it. Research, development and future enrichment capacity There would be limits on the R&amp;D work Iran could do on advanced centrifuges, so that it could not suddenly upgrade its enrichment capacity after the first 10 years of the agreement and bring its breakout time down from one year to a few weeks almost overnight. Iran would be able to test experimental new centrifuges on a small scale according to a gradual plan. The heavy water reactor at Arak Iran would remove the reactor core and fill it with concrete. The reactor would be redesigned so that it produces much less plutonium, if any, and all its spent fuel would be shipped out of the country. Iran would refrain from building a reprocessing plant – or even doing research on reprocessing – indefinitely, and would not build any new heavy water plants for 15 years. Inspections Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would have full access to all Iran’s declared nuclear sites as at present, but with much more advanced technology than they are using now. Inspectors would be able to visit non-declared sites where they think nuclear work might be going on. A commission made up of a range of IAEA members would be set up to judge whether the inspectors’ access requests are justified, and would take its decision by majority vote. Investigation into past activity Iran has agreed a “road map” with the IAEA officials by which it would provide access to facilities and people suspected of involvement in past experimental work on warhead design, managed by a centralised and covert unit, mostly before 2004. The IAEA would have to certify Iranian cooperation with the inquiry before Iran benefits from sanctions relief. Sanctions relief As Iran takes the agreed steps listed above to reduce the capacity and proliferation risk of its nuclear infrastructure, the US and EU would provide guarantees that financial and economic sanctions will be suspended or cancelled. The EU would stop its oil embargo and end its banking sanctions, and Iran would be allowed to participate in the Swift electronic banking system that is the lifeblood of international finance. Barack Obama would issue presidential waivers suspending the operation of US trade and financial sanctions. A new UN security council resolution and the arms embargo The JCPOA will be incorporated into a new security council resolution intended to replace and supersede six earlier sanctions resolutions imposed on Iran over its nuclear programme. The resolution will be passed before the end of the month but the agreement will not take effect for 90 days, allowing for the domestic political review to be completed. An arms embargo on Iran would remain in place for five years, and a ban on the transfer of missile technology would stay for eight years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jun/25/antarctic-biodiversity-faces-increased-threats-despite-isolation-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T23:56:02Z","webTitle":"Antarctic biodiversity faces increased threats despite isolation, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/antarctic-biodiversity-faces-increased-threats-despite-isolation-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jun/25/antarctic-biodiversity-faces-increased-threats-despite-isolation-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Antarctic biodiversity faces increased threats despite isolation, study finds","bodyText":"The Antarctic and Southern oceans are teeming with life, yet protection measures are weak as the continent faces increased threats from fishing, tourism and science programs, according to a report by scientists reviewing recent studies. The lead author of the report published in the journal Nature, Professor Steven Chown of Monash University, characterised the biodiversity outlook for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean as being “no better than that for the rest of the globe”, despite its relative isolation. The Antarctic marine system hosts more than 8,000 different species, with 50-90% of the species endemic to the region, including sea spiders, isopods and the wandering albatross. On land, there was a “massive diversity” of viruses living in bodies of freshwater and an “extremely well-developed microbial community”. “Most people think of the continent as a vast, icy waste, and the sea as uniformly populated by whales, seals and penguins,” Chown said. “But that’s simply not true. “Certainly you wouldn’t see the same level of diversity as somewhere like the Daintree rainforest in Queensland, but if I was a microbiologist I’d say the Antarctic was home to an amazing diversity of organisms.” Antarctica, roughly the size of the US and Mexico combined, was not a single, homogenous area but had 15 distinct biogeographic zones, Chown said. These included the dramatic, 4,000 metre heights of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains, home to “really unusual lichens and mosses”, and the geothermally heated volcanoes of the north-east Antarctic peninsula, which played an important role as refuges for wildlife from icy, glacial conditions. Increasing wind speeds, associated with the hole in the ozone layer, had also improved conditions for the wandering albatross. “Because it’s gotten windier they’re able to travel faster, and that means their foraging trips are shorter,” Chown said. “They’ve become much heavier.” But other forms of human interference linked to increased fishing activity, tourism and scientific programs posed a threat to biodiversity. “People have been driving ATVs [all-terrain vehicles] through moss beds, science stations have been dumping their sewage and oil spills have gone underreported,” he said. And the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection, which states that the region should only be used for scientific and “peaceful purposes”, had quickly been interpreted as allowing any activity, “as long as it’s not military or a nuclear power plant”. Only 1.5% of the land and less than 10% of the oceans around Antarctica fall under special protection. A long-running proposal to designate the Ross Sea, sometimes called “the last ocean” of the world because of its pristine condition, as a marine reserve has so far failed to be negotiated by the convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. Generally, good control measures had prevented the introduction of invasive alien species – with the notable exception of annual bluegrass, which was quickly outcompeting the only two indigenous flowering plants on the continent: the Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort. Chown said protected areas of the Antarctic should match the global Aichi biodiversity targets of 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of marine and coastal areas protected by 2020. Achieving this required a dedicated plan for biodiversity conservation, to be implemented by the Antarctic treaty parties. The plan would identify which areas should be protected and how they would be set aside and managed. It would also call for coordinated investigations into the drivers of biodiversity loss, including ocean acidification, extinction risk assessments and studies into genetic diversity for the region. A plan being drafted should be ready by the end of 2016, which would then be presented to all the treaty parties, Chown said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/04/angela-merkels-influence-now-extends-to-german-slang-merkeln","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-04T14:49:27Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel's influence now extends to German slang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/04/angela-merkels-influence-now-extends-to-german-slang-merkeln","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/04/angela-merkels-influence-now-extends-to-german-slang-merkeln","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel's influence now extends to German slang","bodyText":"It is, perhaps, a measure of just how powerful she has become: Angela Merkel now appears to be influencing youth slang. The compilers of Germany’s most popular dictionary say that the verb “merkeln” is on track to become the most popular “youth word” of the year. Media strategists around the chancellor who may have fleetingly thought they could seize on the opportunity to encourage more young people to support the German chancellor will, however, have been quickly disappointed. The word is none-too flattering, meaning being indecisive, or failing to have an opinion on something – behaviour that Germans often attribute to Merkel. In a nationwide poll to choose Germany’s favourite new words and phrases invented and used by young people, “merkeln” is currently topping a 30-strong list featuring other pop culture terminology such as “earthporn”, which means a beautiful landscape, “shippen”, to be in a relationship (from the “ship” in “relationship”) and “smombie”, or someone who is so fixated on their smart phone, they become zombie-like. The competition has been held by Langenscheidt for the past seven years and aims to reflect the evolving nature of the German tongue. On 31 October, a jury will choose 10 winners – ranking the top five – which will be included in an ever-changing e-book. “Merkeln” is something of a twist on the adjective “merkelsch”, which has been in use since at least 2010 to describe Merkel’s specific form of politics. It is usually placed in front of a word such as “tactics”, “delay” or “calculation” to illustrate her careful and often ponderous approach to everything from the Greek crisis to her decision to turn off Germany’s nuclear power stations in the light of the Fukushima disaster, which in turn gave the world the word “Energiewende” (energy transition). Merkel observers put the chancellor’s approach down to her training in quantum physics, which leads her to work a problem through step by step like an experiment, rather than trying to predict its outcome in advance. But amid growing rumours this week that 61-year-old Merkel has decided to run for a fourth term in office, her entry into the dictionary reflects just what a mainstay she has become in both German and global politics. Reports this week in Der Spiegel say that Merkel and the party secretary of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) have already met to discuss the tactics for her re-election. With her popularity ratings having remained for years on a level that most democratically-elected politicians could only dream of, not only has the CDU not really been able to produce a viable Merkel successor, but some from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have admitted their party is at a loss to put up a candidate who would have any chance of convincingly running against her. At a time when young people’s interest in politics is often perceived to be on the wane, the fact that Germany’s youth are talking about her at all is seen as a good sign within CDU circles, and offers a boost to Merkel’s recent attempts to expand her reach to teenagers. Last month, to the consternation of many established journalists, she granted a half-hour interview to a popular YouTube anchorman known as LeFloid, who boasts around 2.6 million viewers to his news channel, which is broadcast from his bedroom. The two discussed everything from gay marriage to the rise of nationalism, and millions tuned in. Merkel has also started holding town-hall style discussions with young people to talk about the future of Germany. However, a recent one of those went viral after she was forced to confront the reality of her government’s policies when a Palestinian refugee who had lived in Germany for four years sobbed after being told by Merkel she could not guarantee her family would be able to stay in Germany. Merkel was captured on camera stroking the girl’s shoulder, creating what Germans commonly refer to as a “shitstorm” (a word they use to mean vociferous outrage expressed on the internet and which was voted Germany’s anglicism of the year in 2011.) Merkel’s office has not commented on her dictionary nomination so far, though they might arguably have been able to insist the word was rude or discriminatory, on the same grounds that the nominated word “Alpha Kevin”, meaning the “thickest person of all” was removed from Langenscheidt list, after a reported spate of complaints from people called Kevin, or their parents. “We did not intend to discriminate against specific persons,” said a statement from Langenscheidt, “so we removed the name.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/29/new-york-chicanery-george-osborne-robert-moses","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-29T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Tales of hi-vis New York chicanery from Osborne’s favourite author | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/29/new-york-chicanery-george-osborne-robert-moses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/29/new-york-chicanery-george-osborne-robert-moses","fields":{"headline":"Tales of hi-vis New York chicanery from Osborne’s favourite author","bodyText":"It was an eerie moment. The former foreign secretary William Hague told the American biographer Robert Caro that he was George Osborne’s favourite author. Caro was pleased, not least as he was about to have dinner with Osborne at Downing Street. He was in town to address a packed Intelligence Squared audience at the relaunch of his 1974 biography of Robert Moses, the New York boss. The book is a modern Machiavelli’s Prince, and has become more famous than its subject. Caro replied to Hague by describing how his book began. As a young journalist he had researched a senseless proposal from Moses, a local agency official, to build a toll bridge on Long Island Sound. Every local politician and expert opposed it. Caro wrote his story and assumed the project was dead. Then Moses went to the state capital in Albany and, in one day flat, got his bridge approved. How on earth, Caro asked himself, could an unelected official convert New York’s entire political establishment to favour his absurd bridge? The question came to obsess him: hence the book. But today, he said, times had moved on. Democracy was too transparent for such chicanery. His audience tittered nervously. Surely Caro had just described George Osborne. He is Britain’s Robert Moses, king of hi-vis projects, driver of madcap HS2 and Hinkley Point. What did Caro mean, times had moved on? Anyone following Osborne’s vanity projects knows they are today’s Long Island bridges. Serious transport and energy economists groan at the mention of HS2 and Hinkley Point. Officials mutter they are “essentially political decisions”, which is Whitehall-speak for daft. What is compelling in Caro’s books – on Moses and his more famous subject, Lyndon B Johnson – is his analysis of what forms of power really influenced such decisions. The unelected Moses manipulated his local boards – quangos to us – to stay in office for 40 years. He exploited bridge tolls and property values to make New York his slave. When a mayor tried to argue that he was the boss, Moses replied curtly: “Read the contract.” Moses built the infrastructure of the world’s greatest city, but he was a racist obsessive who tried to stop the poor getting to beaches and ghettoised Manhattan. He would say, only half joking: “Nothing I have ever done has been tinged with legality.” As his empire grew rich, New York slid towards bankruptcy. Johnson, for his part, lied, cheated and bullied his way to power. He used the senate pork barrel to break the southern caucus on segregation. He duly effected a revolution in civil rights and social policy that had defeated his predecessor, Kennedy. Yet he was also the bombardier of Vietnam and architect of America’s worst ever military defeat. Neither man was happy when power departed. Moses ended his days obsessed with Caro’s book; Johnson ended his in a lonely backwoods ranch, his head morbidly ringing to “that ghastly, ghastly song: Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?”. Moses and Johnson did much that was good – Johnson unquestionably so. And he at least was elected. But their politics was that of the favour, the kickback, the lobbyist, the contract. Neither was honest or scrupulous. As Moses said: “If the ends don’t justify the means, what does?” Questioners pleaded with Caro to update his insights to the present day. He refused. When asked if, on balance, he thought the ends achieved by Moses and Johnson did indeed justify the means, he again refused. “There were good things and bad things,” the sensible historian said. We need feel no such restraint. Moses certainly got things built, seven bridges and 15 expressways, but most cities have them, without New York’s engineered segregation. Johnson undoubtedly transformed America’s race politics, but that would have come in time. Both men overcame the political and bureaucratic drag that afflicts modern administration, but they did not change it: look at Washington today. I am closer to Archie Brown’s The Myth of the Strong Leader, which argues that too much is attributed to such heroes: “Huge power amassed by individuals paves the way for errors at best and disaster and bloodshed at worst.” Caro’s question remains: how do projects as various as a Long Island bridge or Vietnam war survive what should be stringent democratic audit? How can a British cabinet approve the world’s most extravagant high-speed railway and the world’s most expensive nuclear power station, when alternatives are available and cost less? How did it approve Iraq? Caro constantly recites Acton’s maxim on the corrupting effect of power, but the cliche holds. The reasons given to justify HS2 and Hinkley Point are mostly rubbish, and Osborne is too intelligent not to know it. Yet the sheer money at the disposal of modern government gives untrammelled power to those who can circumvent the normal checks and balances – and distorts judgment. When someone has a sufficient interest in something – profit, vanity, glory, whim – democracy (between elections) is rarely strong enough to stand in the way. However potent the politician, he or she is rarely big enough to admit a mistake. They even prefer to pursue folly to prove their power. Osborne’s megaprojects are like his tax credit reforms, with too much reputation invested to back down. Besides, as Deep Throat said, we should always follow the money. Where will Hinkley’s £25bn, HS2’s £80bn, or untold sums on Heathrow runways, Cricks of the north, concert halls and garden bridges actually go? The answer is the same place as £9bn on the Olympics: to the big international consultancy and construction firms that suck economic rent out of these state projects. With so much money swilling about, power can find allies wherever it sticks. Reason is for wimps. David Cameron, in his now familiar disjunction of perception and action, never spoke truer than in 2010, when he said that lobbying by “crony capitalism” was “the next big scandal waiting to happen”. It was something his government “could no longer ignore”. He was to prove its greatest sucker. As for Osborne, he gleefully listed his projects to the Tory conference last month and cried: “We are the builders!” But who gets the contract, and who will vet it? Democracy is said to be a bad form of government, but all the others are worse.

These are difficult times, and the catalogue of potential threats includes many that may seem familiar, including high unemployment, war and the spread of infectious disease. It is particularly telling, therefore, given the dangers confronting us, that the report points to water crises as one of the top global risks. Competition for increasingly scarce water resources is already a real and compelling issue, impacting economies and societies in both the developing and developed world. Shortages are localised, which can create an immediate impact on communities, but also have the potential to have truly global consequences. The US has a significant influence on the global food trade, from essential cereal crops to fruits and nuts. Indeed, the US accounts for 32% of global corn production and 31% of global soybean production (pdf) – both vital staples. As a result, the ongoing water crisis in California – the country’s largest agricultural producer – may threaten the price and availability of certain commodities worldwide. The situation is exacerbated, globally and in the US, by intensified competition between agriculture and industry. Driven by population growth, urbanisation and climate change, power generators, chemical producers and oil and gas fields are increasingly in a rivalry with agricultural lands over finite freshwater resources. Electric power generation in particular is both highly dependent on the local availability of freshwater and extremely water intensive (pdf). On average, research from MSCI ESG has demonstrated that electric utilities consume 11 times more water than all other industries combined. At the same time, industrial water users typically have a higher capacity to absorb the increased costs associated with rising water prices in comparison to agricultural water users, threatening an impact on crop production and yield if farmers are priced out of the market. The stress on water resources is already considerable. Within the US, 18% of harvested cropland is irrigated (pdf), most of which is attributed to corn, soy, wheat and hay, but also includes water-intensive crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, rice and cotton. Some 412 irrigation-intensive US counties are currently facing moderate to high levels of water stress – around 23% of total US land area. Nevertheless, according to our research, approximately one-third of publicly traded US electric utilities – including Xcel Energy, Exelon, Pinnacle West Capital and Calpine – derive more than 10% of their electric power generation from already water stressed regions. One in every four publicly traded US electric utilities operate in counties that are both water stressed and irrigation intensive. We have seen a number of cases in which low water levels and high temperatures compounded into production disruptions. In 2010, Tennessee Valley Authority’s Browns Ferry nuclear power plant in Alabama was forced to reduce generation to 40-60% of normal operating capacity for 45 days during the summer. Similar events occurred during France’s record-breaking heat waves during 2003 and 2007. These challenges are only likely to intensify, especially for companies that are reliant on water-intensive coal and nuclear power sources in irrigation-intensive regions. Similarly, an estimated $1.2bn (£790m) in maize, soy and wheat crops may be at risk in US states where competition with industrial water users is high. As a percentage of total production, this is relatively small (between 0.2% and 1.2% of the total harvest), but the problem is expanding to other crops. For example, MSCI ESG Research has shown that for regional crops like cotton and sugar beet, the percentage of exposed acreage is up to six times higher as key growing areas such as North Dakota, Texas and California are experiencing water-intensive oil and gas booms. In the US, if the situation remains as it is today, the competition for water resources may reach a tipping point that results in stranded assets, reduced productivity, and increased tensions between farmers and industry. In the medium term, policymakers may need to dictate water allocation priorities. As the World Economic Forum’s report reminds us, however, dealing with issues of water scarcity will be a global challenge, one that faces us now, and a problem that will be with us for the foreseeable future.

But remembrance services held in Tokyo and along the flattened coastline were tinged with frustration at the slow pace of rebuilding, with almost a quarter of a million people still displaced. More than 18,000 people died on 11 March 2011 after the strongest recorded earthquake in Japan’s history triggered a tsunami that laid waste to entire towns and villages and caused a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Tokyo, the emperor and empress led tributes to those who died, and gave encouragement to the 230,000 people who remain unable to go home, including 120,000 whose homes were irradiated by the nuclear disaster. At 2:46pm, the exact time the magnitude-9 earthquake struck, people across the country observed a moment’s silence; in the devastated coastal communities, tsunami warning sirens sounded in an eerie reminder of the moment the quake triggered the country’s worst disaster since the second world war. “I prayed at the memorial to say that we will not ever forget you, and we are managing the best we can here,” said a woman from Ishinomaki, one of the worst-hit towns. Her son said: “Reconstruction hasn’t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone’s doing the best they can so we have to too.” But work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline. Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors. In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown. “Reconstruction is shifting to a new stage,” Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. “We will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.” Although some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo. Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area. “A large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,” said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate. “We don’t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won’t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.” Young families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units. Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. “We used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,” Endo said. “That’s no longer possible. It’s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.” At Fukushima Daiichi – scene of the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl – optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site. Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen. Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis. All of Japan’s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster. The country’s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe’s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months. The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-11T18:03:08Z","webTitle":"NHS England chief says May 'stretching it' to say NHS getting more extra money than it asked for - politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"NHS England chief says May 'stretching it' to say NHS getting more extra money than it asked for - politics live","bodyText":"Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has undermined Theresa May’s claim to be funding health properly by flatly contradicting her assertion that the service has been given all the money it wants. He made the point during an assertive appearance before the Commons public accounts committee during which he also disagreed openly with Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health. Wormald said spending on health in the UK was in line with the OECD average. Stevens said that that was misleading because the OECD figures included countries like Mexico, that the UK spent less than on health than comparable advanced nations, and that it spent 30% less on health per head than Germany. May has repeatedly said that the NHS was given more than Stevens requested when he set out his five-year plan. But Stevens denied this. He told the MPs: Like probably every part of the public service we got less than we asked for in that process. So I think it would be stretching it to say the NHS has got more than it asked for ... There are clearly very substantial pressures, and I don’t think it helps anybody to try and pretend that there aren’t. Stevens, a former Labour councillor and a health adviser to Tony Blair who was appointed to run NHS England by David Cameron, was not asked about a Times story claiming that No 10 aides think his unenthusiastic approach is contributing to problems in the NHS. (See 9.21am.) But his evidence, which also saw him demanding a more robust government response to the social care crisis, was interpreted as him fighting back. (See 4.35pm.) Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has claimed that Labour’s proposals to scrap corporation tax cuts to release more money for health are “mortally dangerous” to the NHS. Speaking in a Commons debate on the NHS called by Labour he said: This reveals, I’m afraid, a fundamental misunderstanding about how you fund the NHS. Corporation taxes are being cut so that we can boost jobs and strengthen the economy so that we can fund the NHS. The reason we’ve been able to protect and increase funding in the NHS in the last six years, when the party opposite was not willing to do so, is precisely because we’ve created two million jobs and we’ve given this country the fastest growing economy in the G7 - and that is even more important post-Brexit. So to risk that growth, which is what their proposal will do, would not just risk funding for the NHS - it’d be dangerous for the economy and mortally dangerous for the NHS. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has attempted to pave the way for a smooth Brexit by assuring Germany that the UK has no desire to disrupt the EU during its divorce from Brussels. Germany’s largest centre-left party says it would be prepared to let the country’s own short-term economic interests take a back seat and make the “unity of the European Union” a priority in the upcoming Brexit negotiations if it were to form part of the next government. Dairy farms in Northern Ireland will “go out of business” after Brexit if barriers to trade with the Republic of Ireland are erected, the government has been warned. The Foreign Office is to review its policy on forced marriage after the Guardian revealed that victims are ordered to repay the government the costs of their repatriation. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Q: What effect would a hard Brexit have on the NHS? Wormald says Brexit would raise issues for the DoH. But the issue does not dominate the department’s thinking. There would be an impact on workforce, and impact on drug regulation and an impact on the mutal recognition of health costs. But the government is not giving a running commentary, he says. Stevens says about a quarter of NHS doctors are foreign nationals. The NHS has a slight advantage, in terms of having a relatively low proportion of hospital doctors over 55. But the NHS will continue to need to hire foreign staff. Mackey says this year the NHS will deliver efficiency savings at just over 3%. He says 4% has been set as a target. He says he would like these targets to be lower. He says people did not expect the NHS to be able to achieve the efficiencies it has managed this year. But it will not be possible to go on like this forever, he says. The Times story this morning said Downing Street aides complain that Simon Stevens is not “enthusiastic”. (See 9.21am.) The Times’s Chris Smyth says Stevens has been using his evidence this afternoon to hit back quite pointedly. And this is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. Just hours after the prime minister stands up at PMQs commending her government’s funding of the NHS, the NHS England chief tells MPs that it would be stretching it to say that the NHS has got more money than it asked for. Theresa May is in total denial about the crisis the Tories have created in the NHS. The warnings from professionals and patients have flooded in, but Theresa May has just buried her head in the sand. At prime minister’s questions today she again refused Labour’s calls for extra funding, claiming that she’s given the NHS the money it needs. But her argument has now been blown out of the water by two top NHS chiefs who have starkly laid out the truth: the NHS is facing financial crisis under the Tories. Enough is enough. Theresa May needs to come out of her bunker, admit she’s got it wrong and guarantee the funding the NHS needs. Number 10 should listen to the experts like Simon Stevens and not be briefing against him. The two NHS “chiefs” Ashworth is referring to are Chris Hopson (see 3.04pm) and Simon Stevens (see 3.15pm and 4.40pm.) Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem health spokesman, has put out this response to Simon Stevens’ comments about the NHS not getting all the money it wanted. He said: These worrying comments reinforce the case for a fresh approach to NHS funding. The government must stop trying to shoot the messenger and admit that current levels of underfunding are not sustainable. We urgently need serious cross-party discussions on how to fund the NHS and social care in the long-term, or standards will fall and patients will suffer. Partisan politics has failed, and no one party can provide a solution to this crisis. My genuine hope is that the prime minister’s acceptance of my request to meet [see 12.28pm] might be the start of a more rational approach, which could provide the NHS and social care with the resources they need to provide high-quality care for future generations. Stevens is now talking about STP’s (sustainability and transformation plans). Here is a video clip of Simon Stevens saying the NHS got less than it asked for. Simon Stevens has been going for almost an hour and a half now, and he still has not been asked about today’s Times splash. (See 9.21am.) But the Times story may explain Stevens’ tone. This is from Alastair McLellan, editor of the Health Service Journal. Stevens says there are four beds in care home for every acute hospital bed. So what happens in care homes affects hospital. He says the problems in the care sector need to be stabilised “pretty quickly”. Then the government needs to push health and social care integration over the next few years. And, after 2020, the government needs a proper review of the way health and social care is funded. ITV’s political editor Robert Peston reckons there is something remarkable about the NHS chief executive openly contradicting the DoH permanent secretary. Caroline Flint, the Labour MP and a former health minister, goes next. Q: Labour built health centres to improve what services GPs can offer. Why are these not being used? Stevens says GPs’ views have changed. In the past, when “polyclinics” were proposed, GPs would run a mile. He says, although the NHS is efficient, there are still more efficiencies that can be achieved. This is from Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh. And this is from the Times’ Patrick Kidd. Wormald says total health spending is around the average for the OECD. Stevens says he does not like to disagree with Wormald. The OECD includes countries like Mexico. If we look at countries we normally compare ourselves to, we are spending less than the average. We are spending 30% less per head than Germany, he says. He produced a newspaper cutting from the Daily Mail saying Britain spends less than Europe on doctors, beds and scanners. He implies that is a tribute to the NHS’s efficiency. UPDATE: And this is from Health Service Journal’s Dave West commenting on Waugh’s tweet. Steven says he is going to refresh his five-year NHS plan. He says the update will be produced by the end of March. Here is Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, commenting on Simon Stevens’s evidence. Stevens says life expectancy is rising five hour a day. Q: Why are hospitals busier now than before? Mackey says some of it is to do with social care. Some of it is consumer led. There has also been a spike recently in people admitted with respiratory problems. Some of these are people who would not have been alive a few years ago, so some of this is increasing life expectancy, he says. Anne Marie Morris, a Conservative, says people who turn up to A&amp;E get treated for free. But if they turn up to a GP, they have to pay for prescriptions. Is that encouraging people to go to A&amp;E? Stevens says he will write to the committee about this point. Meg Hillier goes back to the four-hour waiting time issue. She quotes from what Jeremy Hunt said on Monday. He talked about it applying to urgent cases. Stevens says the government has committed to maintaining the target. But clinic operating patterns have changed. And the places you can go to get urgent care are expanding. He says people think the target is to be seen within four hours. But the target is for people to be treated within four hours, or admitted to hospital. As a result, some people get admitted to hospital after three hours and 59 minutes so the target gets met. That is something that should be looked at, he says. Kwasi Kwarteng, a Conservative, goes next. Q: What can the government do to help? Stevens says some of the things that the NHS is doing it would be doing even if it were awash with cash. People are living longer. So health services need to be reconfigured. He says demand for health services depends on how healthy people are. And that is determined by things outside the health service. For example, smoking is going down. But child obesity is going up. And there are things the government can do to address that. Second, the government could look at the way funding terms relating to retirees are directed. This is from the Times’ Chris Smyth. Q: Will targets be relaxed? Mackey says targets will not be relaxed. Jim Mackey, the NHS Improvement chief executive, says it is hard to manage risk when departments are crowded. The NHS is trying to address this. It will look at whether there should be new standards, for example saying some patients need to be seen in two hours. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, says Jeremy Hunt said on Monday that the four-hour A&amp;E target was being dropped. Wormald says Hunt did not say that. He says Hunt was making the point that we need a conversation about how and A&amp;E is used. Q: So the target is not being dropped? No, says Wormald. It is staying. Q: But it is being breached? Wormald says it is extremely important. It is the toughest target of its kind in the world. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the DoH, says the A&amp;E target is staying. Stevens says, given what the NHS needs to do, especially to support GPs, there will have to be capital investment. The NHS has got some of that. But there are many more schemes it could be funding than it is funding. There is “an unmet need” for capital investment, he says. Stevens says the five-year plan envisaged expanding capital investment. But it is being cut by about £1bn a year, he says. Stevens says there are “very real pressures” in the here and now. Over the next three years there will be very real pressures. And by the end of the decade health spending per person will have gone down, he says. Here is more from Simon Stevens’ opening remarks. Simon Stevens is giving evidence with Chris Wormald, permanent secretary of the Department of Health (DoH), David Williams, director general finance and group operations at the DoH and Jim Mackey, chief executive at NHS Improvement. Wormald says the NHS got all that it asked for. But this is a challenging time, he says. Q: How confident are you you will balance the budget? Wormald says he aims and expects to hit the budget. The Simon Stevens hearing is starting now. Q: Is the NHS getting more money than it asks for? Simon Stevens says the NHS will get an extra £10bn over six years. But the forward view was for five years. He says it would be “stretching it’ to say the NHS has got more than it asked for. (Theresa May has said that the NHS asked for £8bn from government and that it has been given £10bn.) The NHS is facing “substantial pressures”, he says. The NHS was fortunate to get front-loaded increases, he says. But he says there are “genuine choices” to be made. And here is a chart from the NAO report showing the growing gap between NHS trusts spending and income. Here is a summary of the National Audit Office report, Financial sustainability of the NHS, that this committee inquiry is based on. And this is what Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said when the report was published. With more than two-thirds of trusts in deficit in 2015-16 and an increasing number of clinical commissioning groups unable to keep their spending within budget, we repeat our view that financial problems are endemic and this is not sustainable. It is fair to say aggressive efficiency targets have helped to swell the ranks of trusts in deficit over the last few years. The Department, NHS England and NHS Improvement have put considerable effort and funding toward stabilising the system, but have a way to go to demonstrate that they have balanced resources and achieved stability as a result of this effort. Therefore, value for money from these collective actions has not yet been demonstrated. The Commons public accounts committee is holding a hearing as part of its inquiry into the financial stability of the NHS this afternoon, and Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England is due to give evidence after 3pm. Here is a briefing from the committee about the inquiry. And here is an extract. The financial performance of NHS bodies worsened considerably in 2015–16 and this trend is not sustainable, according to the National Audit Office. In 2015–16, NHS commissioners, NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts reported a combined deficit of £1.85 billion, a greater than three-fold increase in the deficit position of £574 million reported in 2014–15. Provider trusts’ overall deficit grew by 185% to £2.45 billion, up from £859 million in 2014–15, against total income of £75.97 billion. In addition, two-thirds of NHS trusts (65%) and NHS foundation trusts (66%) reported deficits in 2015-16, up from 44% of NHS trusts and 51% of NHS foundation trusts in the previous financial year. The number of clinical commissioning groups reporting cumulative deficits was 32 in 2015–16, up from 19 in both 2014–15 and 2013–14. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, is giving evidence to the committee at the moment. He told MPs that he does not think the NHS has got all the money it needs. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is currently giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. He has said that Brexi is no longer the most significant domestic risk to economic stability. My colleague Nick Fletcher is covering it on the business live blog. The British Red Cross description of the NHS as facing a humanitarian crisis was “irresponsible and overblown”, Theresa May has said during a prime minister’s questions centred on the current problems in the health service. May has said the crisis in Northern Ireland will not delay the triggering of article 50. (See 12.52pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has accused May of being “in denial” about the state of the NHS. Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, has been defended by MPs for sounding the alarm over health funding, amid reports of tensions with Downing Street over his handling of the A&amp;E winter crisis. The government is seriously considering imposing a £1,000-a-year levy on every European Union skilled worker recruited by British employers after Brexit, the immigration minister has disclosed. A hard Brexit could cause the “biggest disaster” in higher education for many years, academics have warned. As the Press Association reports, applications from across the European Union have already dropped by 14% at Cambridge University for undergraduate courses, MPs were told. Hostility towards immigrants, devaluation of the pound and uncertainty over research projects have also deterred postgraduates from heading to the UK, the education select committee was told. Quitting the EU provides opportunities to improve research funding and international collaboration but a so-called hard Brexit would be damaging for the sector, academics said. Alistair Fitt, vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: “It would probably be the biggest disaster for the universities sector in many years.” Cabinet ministers have privately conceded that they are very likely to lose a landmark legal case on Brexit in the supreme court and have drawn up at least two versions of a bill that could be tabled after the ruling. It has also emerged today that the supreme court will not be giving the government an advance copy of its judgment, which means Theresa May, and everyone else, will only find out what they have decided as they announce it in court. Theresa May has been urged to stop the Green Investment Bank being “killed off” by a sale to private firm Macquarie, amid fears the assets will be stripped and its environmental purpose abandoned. As Rowena Mason reports, MPs from across the parties raised concerns about the proposed sale in the House of Commons, after Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, called a debate arguing the whole process should be stopped. Nick Hurd, an energy minister, refused even to confirm that Macquarie is the preferred bidder, citing commercial sensitivity.But Lucas launched into an attack on the Australian investment bank, saying it had a “very, very worrying and dubious track record”. She said: This preferred bidder, Macquarie, not only has a dismal and terrible environmental record, it also has an appalling track record of asset stripping. So why has the government given preferred bidder status to this company? The main nationalist opposition party in Northern Ireland has called for joint London and Dublin rule if attempts to establish devolution fail after elections to the Stormont assembly. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. Most seem to think Jeremy Corbyn won. From ITV’s Robert Peston From Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis From the Spectator’s James Forsyth From the Financial Times’ Sebastian Payne From the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Guardian’s Anushka Asthana From the BBC’s Norman Smith From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the Times’ Matt Chorley From the Guardian’s Rafael Behr From the Independent’s John Rentoul From the BBC’s Vicki Young From ITV’s Chris Ship From the Times’ Patrick Kidd From PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield From Sky’s Robert Nisbet From Sky’s Beth Rigby PMQs - Verdict: One of the challenges of leadership is not just doing the right thing but being seen to do the right thing. Taking charge, getting on the front foot, seizing the initiative. Not just leading, but showing leadership. And that was Theresa May’s main problem today. She could respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s questions about the NHS with a measure of authority, but she did not sound like someone engaging with the scale of the problems afflicting the NHS or with much idea about what to do about them. Corbyn won comfortably. Perhaps she thinks the whole thing is just routine winter difficulties whose seriousness has been exaggerated by a politically-motivated opposition, publicity-seeking charities and the sensationalist press (like that well-known leftist organ, the Sun). Even if May did take this view, she should have something more to say. But all the evidence points to the NHS and the care system facing a structural crisis, not just a seasonal one, and May came across as complacent. This was exemplified by this answer, in response to a question from Corbyn about a particular NHS horror story. She replied: I accept there have been a small number of incidents where unacceptable practices have taken place but what matters - we don’t want those things to happen - is how you then deal with them. She may come to regret that phrase “small number of incidents”. I have not done a count, but Corbyn now seems to have won most of the encounters he has had with May since the autumn of last year. They are not flashy, knock-out victories, but he is asking solid questions and exposing May’s weaknesses. Before Corbyn became party leader many people assumed that PMQs would be the one area where his deficiencies would be most exposed. But, surprisingly, PMQs is now becoming one of the arenas in which his leadership is at its most assured. As usual, I missed the questions from Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, because I was writing up the snap verdict. Here’s a catch-up. Robertson asked about the crisis in Northern Ireland. Will the prime minister tell us what the consequences will be if no agreement can be found? May said the government was trying to strike a deal. We are treating this with the utmost seriousness. The Northern Ireland secretary is urging all parties to work together to find a way further, I myself have also spoken to the Taoiseach about this issue so we are putting every effort into this. If within seven days we don’t have nomination for a deputy first minister the matter would go to an election. Robertson then argued that, if Northern Ireland does not have an executive, May would not be able to fulfil her promise to consult it about Brexit. And he asked if May would be willing to postpone triggering article 50. It stands to reason that she’ll be unable to properly consult, to fully discuss and find agreement on the complex issues in this time period. In these circumstances, will the prime minister postpone invoking article 50, or will she just plough on regardless? May ruled out delaying article 50. It’s about ensuring, as he says, we want to ensure we do hear the views from all parts of the UK, that’s why we have established the joint ministerial committee European committee to take the view and the JMC plenary. First of all we want to try to ensure that within this period of seven days we can find a resolution to the political situation in Northern Ireland, but I’m also clear that in the discussions we have it will be possible - it is still the case that ministers are in place and executives are in place - that we are still able to take the views of the people of Northern Ireland. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. My colleague Anushka Asthana, the Guardian’s joint political editor, will shortly be discussing PMQs in a video on the Guardian’s Facebook page where she will also be taking questions from readers/viewers. Nicky Morgan, a Conservative, asks about a constituent battling cancer. Her tax credits have been stopped, she says. Can May get the Treasury to look at this? May says she is sorry to hear about this. She says a Treasury minister will look at this case. And that’s it. PMQs is over. (That was quite short by John Bercow’s standards. It over-ran by less then 10 minutes.) The DUP’s Gavin Robinson asks May that nothing can be or should be gained from threatening the peace process in Northern Ireland. May says the progress made in Northern Ireland has been hard won. That is why it is important to get a return to the power-sharing institutions. Labour’s John Woodcock says 24-hour access to A&amp;E and maternity services risk being lost in Copeland (where there is a byelection). Expectant mums face a 40-mile journey on roads that could be blocked. May says she understands the problems in Cumbria. A lasting plan is being developed for high quality services. She says final decisions about the unit at West Cumbria hospital have not yet been taken. The SNP’s Alan Brown asks why Steve Webb has been given a knighthood given his role in the raising of the state pension age for women, which has led to waspi (women against state pension inequality) losing out. May sidesteps the knighthood point, but defends the government’s record on pensions. James Davies, a Conservative, asks if May will support a plan to invest in rail infrastructure in north Wales. May says this plan sets out an ambitious programme. The department for transport will work on this. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry says many banks are closing local branches, with adverse effects on the elderly. Convenience stores are taking up the strain. Will May meet her to discuss how banking can service the community? May says there are many ways people can access bank services. But she will look at this, she says. Edward Argar, a Conservative, says nothing can be more distressing for a parent than having a child murdered. He says two families are setting up a campaign for better treatment of victims’ families after an acquital. May pays tribute to the campaigners. She says she is committed to ensure the voices of victims are heard. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is taking this forward, she says. The Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb says there genuine concerns about the NHS. That is why MPs from all parties are calling for an NHS and care convention. Would May meet with them to hear their case? May says she would be happy to have that meeting. Richard Fuller, a Conservative, asks about the Bedford community business school. Will May ensure her industrial strategy takes account of small business. May says it will be looking to the economy of the future. Crucial to that is the growth generated by entrepreneurs. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn had the best of that exchange, May finished strongly, but her jibe about Labour making multiple pledges based on corporation tax savings could not really dispel the impression that she had little or nothing to say about a crisis that goes well beyond routine opposition shroud-waving. The NHS is traditionally a good subject for Labour but Corbyn was passionate and focused, he responded particularly well to May’s point about mental health and he sounded credible and convincing. May had her moments - her British Red Cross put-down will probably resonate with many - but generally she gave the impression of being a politician on the defensive, not someone taking charge. Corbyn says no one wants mental health patients to go to A&amp;E. But people are desperate. And social care is not being properly funded. So will the government do what Labour is demanding and bring forward social care spending. (See 10.47am.) May says Corbyn asked about this before Christmas. He may find it strange that people say the same as they did a few weeks ago. Half of delayed discharges are in just a few areas. That shows that this is about best practice. Corbyn says he will continue to do this because May has not addressed the budget. The government has cut the social care budget. May said she wanted a shared society. She has got that. More people sharing hospital corridors on trolleys, and more people sharing A&amp;E departments. May is in denial. The NHS is in crisis. He says she should cancel corporation tax cuts. May quotes from a Labour MP saying the opposition has to be more grown up. She says Labour has already spent the corporation tax cut revenue Corbyn mentioned already eight times. Yesterday Corbyn indicated that he was incompetent. If he was in charge, the economy would suffer, she says. Corbyn says May seems to be in denial. She won’t listen to experts. So will she listen to Sian, who works in the NHS. He quotes from an account from Sian about a child not getting proper help. May says there have been a small number of incidents where unacceptable things took place. The NHS must learn lessons from them. She says we should be grateful for NHS professionals. The Tuesday after Christmas was the busiest day ever in the NHS. And more people are being treated by A&amp;E than ever before. Corbyn says we all praise the NHS. But the government is planning to cut a third of beds. The BBC revealed last night there has been an 89% increase in people with mental health issues going to A&amp;E. So shouldn’t mental health spending by ring-fenced. May says in her speech on Monday she said there was more that could be done. But this is about appropriate care. When she was in Aldershot on Monday, she spoke to patients who said they did not want to go to A&amp;E. In that areas A&amp;E admissions have stabilised because of good practice. Jeremy Corbyn wishes MPs and members of staff a happy new year. He pays tribute to a 22-year-old soldier who died in a non-combat incident in Iraq. And he sends condolences to the family of the seven-year-old killed in York. He says the Red Cross has described the NHS as being in a humanitarian crisis. Does May agree with Jeremy Hunt about wanting to fiddle the A&amp;E waiting time figures. May also pays tribute to the solider who died in Iraq. He was a fine young man. And she expresses condolences to the family of the girl who died. There are always pressures on the NHS in winter, she says. And we have added pressures because of the ageing population. We have all seen humanitarian crises, she says. To use that description was “irresponsible and overblown”. Corbyn says 1.8m people had to wait longer than four hours in A&amp;E departments last year. The Royal College of Medicine said problems were reaching a dangerous level. Other royal colleges said similar things. If May won’t listen to the Red Cross, who will she listen to? May says more people are being treated every day. But it is not just a question of targets. It is a matter of making sure people are provided with appropriate care. Mark Menzies, a Conservative, asks if May backs the construction of a new nuclear power station in the north east. May says she does support new nuclear, especially as we move to a low carbon society. She welcomes the plan for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria. Chris Law, the SNP MP, says it has been six months since the EU referendum. The Scottish government is the only administration to have published a Brexit plan. Has Theresa May read it? May says she will set out more details of the government’s plans in a few weeks. The SNP wants to leave the UK, and therefore leave the EU, she says. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. PMQs will start in about 10 minutes. It is the first PMQs of 2017. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. And this is from Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons health committee, has used Twitter to defend Simon Stevens in the light of today’s Times story. With Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, giving evidence to the Commons public accounts committee later, it is worth flagging up what David Laws, the Lib Dem former education minister, said about the claim that the government is fully funding Stevens’s five-year plan for the NHS in his book, Coalition. This is from my colleague Denis Campbell’s story about Laws’ claim. In his new book about the coalition, Laws claims that Stevens made clear to Downing Street his view that the NHS needed an extra £15bn or £16bn over that period in order to keep running smoothly while also transforming how it cares for patients. However, Laws writes, in extracts serialised in the Mail on Sunday: “No 10’s reaction was: ‘You’ve got to be joking.’ Stevens was told there was no way the PM and chancellor would sign up to an ‘impossible and excessive’ commitment this size. He was told: ‘Get it down to a more deliverable sum.’” The Five Year Forward View – Stevens’s blueprint to reshape the NHS and close the £30bn gap in its funding expected to have emerged by 2020-21 – was published in October 2014. Stevens indicated that the service could cope with an £8bn rise and would find £22bn of efficiency savings. Laws claims that was because Downing Street had made clear to him that any more than £8bn would be unacceptable to them. It is an open secret at NHS England that its leadership – Stevens and other key figures, including the chairman, Prof Sir Malcolm Grant, and the medical director,Prof Sir Bruce Keogh – think the £8bn is far too little and that the £22bn savings target is unachievable. The Labour MP Frank Field has put out a statement explaining why he is one of the 20 MPs from all the main parties who has signed a letter calling for an NHS and care convention. Here is an extract from the release. Frank has this week been contacted by an A&amp;E nurse who describes herself as ‘broken’. The nurse has reported to Frank that up to five ambulances at a time are queuing each night to offload their patients, as the A&amp;E unit is full to capacity. In addition, nurses are themselves sustaining injuries due to the shortage of staff available to move beds and heavy equipment. The nurse told Frank that, ‘I am desperate. I love nursing but dread going into work every day and night as every day is the same. I have actually cried this week before going in, worrying about what I’m going into. ‘I have been screamed at, had people yelling at me in my face wanting answers and solutions I can’t give as I’m only a nurse. I worry for my patients, I worry for their families, I worry for my colleagues. ‘The only saving grace in this is I’m part of one of the most committed team-spirited and fantastic [group of] people I have ever met. I’m proud to be part of this team but I’m not sure how long we can continue to work like this.’ Field is proposing an immediate 1p increase in national insurance contributions to help fund the NHS, as the first move towards a new National Health and Social Care Service, funded in full by a reformed national insurance system. He said: The funding of the NHS is currently built upon extremely shaky foundations. The impact of this inadequate funding on patient care and staff morale is becoming increasingly clear. I therefore believe that the government should immediately begin weighing up options for an increase health and social care budgets, before taking steps to merge the two services into a combined, adequately funded National Health and Social Care Service. By 1p Field means 1p per pound, obviously. The main national insurance rate for employees is 12%. Field’s plan would take it up to 13%. He would also increase the national insurance paid by employers by the same amount, taking it up from 13.8% (the main rate) to 14.8%. Guardian Health Network have published a good article written anonymously by an NHS trust chair. Here is the full piece. And here is an extract. I think describing the current situation as “a humanitarian crisis” is a bit over the top. The bigger question is that the demands of targets on individual trusts are probably – choosing my words carefully – leading to gaming. Equally we are all meant to have abandoned all elective surgery but there are strong suspicions that certain trusts are not following this; still doing certain surgery because they make so much money. What we are seeing is a breakdown in the trust and cooperation between different parts of the NHS. So we have seen mental health almost withdrawing from the sustainability and transformation plan process. We have major acute hospitals trying to protect their pre-eminent position by being too important/big to work with others. We have clinical commissioning groups in denial about their total absence of any long-term future. We have NHS England shouting down the phone at hard-pressed managers. We have NHS Improvement texting chief executives on Saturday afternoons checking that they are on top of the situation and expecting them to be at work. Not one of these actions is going to help a hard-pressed consultant with targets – or more critically the patient. Worse than that, the pressure from above is largely political because government ministers and MPs cannot accept the reality of the general slide to a service that doesn’t meet what the public expect. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, was on Sky’s All Out Politics a few minutes ago talking about the NHS. Here are the key points. Ashworth criticised Downing Street for reportedly blaming the NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens for conditions in the health service. Ashworth said: I think it is really, really unfair blaming Simon Stevens, who’s a civil servant who runs the NHS. The buck stops with Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt. On Monday Jeremy Hunt appeared to be blaming the public for turning up at A&amp;E. Today they appear to be blaming this poor guy Simon Stevens. No doubt tomorrow they will be blaming the weather. They’ve got to take responsibility. Ashworth re-iterated Labour’s call for the NHS and social care to get more funding. This is the main demand in the Labour motion that MPs will vote on this afternoon. It says: That this House supports NHS England’s four-hour standard, which sets out that a minimum of 95 per cent of all patients to A&amp;E will be treated within four hours; notes the widespread public and medical professional support for this standard; further notes that £4.6bn has been cut from the social care budget since 2010 and that NHS funding will fall per head of population in 2018-19 and 2019-20; and calls on the government to bring forward extra funding now for social care to help hospitals cope this winter, and to pledge a new improved funding settlement for the NHS and social care in the March 2017 budget. Asked how much extra money Labour wanted to spend on the NHS and social care, Ashworth said Labour wanted the £700m extra supposed to be allocated to social care in 2019 to be brought forward. On NHS spending generally, he did not put a figure on how much extra the NHS would get under Labour but he said it was wrong for the government to be cutting corporation tax and inheritance tax when it could be putting this money into health. He refused to back Hunt’s suggestion on Monday that people with non-urgent conditions should stay away from A&amp;E. Asked if he agreed with this, he said people should follow the advice of clinicians, not politicians, about whether they needed to be in A&amp;E. I’m not a clinician so I think people should listen to whatever the clinical advice is to them when they ring 111 ... I don’t think it is appropriate for me as a politician to advise people on medical matters. He said he would be challenging Hunt in today’s debate to say whether or not the government’s A&amp;E target was being watered down. The government amendment to the Labour motion suggests it is not being changed. It says (bold type inserted by me): Leave out from ‘House’ in line 1 to end and add ‘commends NHS staff for their hard work in ensuring record numbers of patients are being seen in A&amp;E; supports and endorses the target for 95 per cent of patients using A&amp;E to be seen and discharged or admitted within four hours; welcomes the government’s support for the Five Year Forward View, the NHS’s own plan to reduce pressure on hospitals by expanding community provision; notes that improvements to 111 and ensuring evening and weekend access to GPs, already covering 17m people, will further help to relieve that pressure; and believes that funding for the NHS and social care is underpinned by the maintenance of a strong economy, which under this administration is now the fastest growing in the G7.’. He said he would be challenging Jeremy Hunt to say what he would do to help hospitals cope if there is a severe cold weather snap. Here’s Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, commenting on the Times’ story. It is blame the expert time again from the Conservatives. Simon Stevens has heroically kept the NHS afloat, despite its scandalous lack of funding. The government is getting slaughtered by MPs of all parties for the NHS crisis it is presiding over, so to distract attention it blames the expert. The public uses NHS hospitals and GP surgeries. It sees the reality. People know Theresa May is starving the NHS of the vital funds it needs. Theresa May should stand down the Number 10 spin doctors and start listening to the person who knows what is really wrong with the NHS. This is what the government is saying in response to the calls for an NHS and care convention. A spokeswoman said: We recognise the pressures of an ageing population which is why we recently announced almost £900m of additional funding for adult social care over the next two years. This government has gone further to integrate health and social care than any other before it. We have brought budgets together for the first time through the Better Care Fund and given the NHS an extra £10bn per year by 2020-21 to fund its own plan to build a more responsive, modern health system. But as the prime minister has made clear, this is not solely about money. That is why we are working to find a long-term, sustainable solution which helps local authorities learn from each other to raise standards across the whole system. The claim that the government is putting an extra £10bn into the NHS is not accepted by Sarah Wollaston, the GP and Conservative MP who chairs the Commons health committee. She says £3.5bn of that is coming from cuts to other areas of health spending. Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem former care minister, was on the Today programme this morning talking about the call backed by MPs from all the main parties for an NHS and care convention to find a long-term solution to the rising medical and care costs caused by having an ageing population. He is urging people to back a petition supporting the idea. The NHS is likely to be the story of the day. With doctors warning that the NHS “will fail” this winter and patient care will suffer unless the government provides an emergency cash injection, Jeremy Corbyn may well decide to lead on the issue at PMQs. Labour is also staging its own debate on a motion calling for the NHS and social care to get more funding. And this afternoon Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, is giving evidence to a committee of MPs. That would be newsworthy anyway but the hearing should have an extra edge because Stevens is the subject of a Times splash saying Number 10 have got it in for him. Here is the Times front page story (paywall). And here is how it starts. Theresa May’s senior aides have privately criticised the head of the NHS as Downing Street seeks to shift the blame for mounting chaos in hospitals. Key members of the prime minister’s team accused Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, of being insufficiently enthusiastic and responsive. They expressed their views in internal meetings, The Times was told. No 10 was also understood to have been irritated by “political” interventions from Mr Stevens, including the suggestion that ministers should pay for social care by abandoning free bus passes and other pensioner perks. Number 10 is playing down the report, but not directly denying it. A Downing Street source said: We don’t recognise any of this. I will reporting more on this as the story develops, as well as focusing on PMQs and the Stevens hearing in detail. But, as usual, I will be also covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: University academics and vice chancellors give evidence to the Commons education committee about Brexit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 12.40pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion demanding extra funding for the NHS and social care. 2.15pm: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 2.30pm: Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the financial sustainability of the NHS.

The news came as a reminder that the international community has failed to come up with meaningful solutions to reverse the trend in greenhouse gas emissions that are a direct cause of global warming. “I, and many other scientists, we are beginning to get worried. Because we see efforts that are not strong enough. We do not see the political will or the leadership to address this issue,” said James Butler, director of the global monitoring division at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The average in atmosphere carbon dioxide concentration observed in March has not been seen by scientists since NOAA monitoring started in 1957. And scientific evidence suggests that these levels have been unseen for the entire history of human civilization as we know it. Babylonian, Chinese and western civilizations were able to develop during a time of climate stability marked by carbon dioxide concentration levels of 270 to 280 parts per million, Butler said. With the dawn of the industrial age, carbon dioxide concentration levels in the atmosphere began to climb, going from 280 parts per million in 1800 to 290 parts per million in 1900. In the last century alone, the rise in concentration is one that would normally be expected to happen over the course of 10,000 or 20,000 years, Butler said – definitely not 100. This March, the International Energy Agency reported that greenhouse gas emissions had plateaued over the last two years, stopping an upward trend. Emissions may have stagnated, but the degree of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere – a direct cause for global warming – is continuing to rise. “Once you get carbon dioxide up in the atmosphere, it’s very difficult to make it go away,” Butler said. Current global emissions would have to be reduced by a momentous 80% in order to stop carbon dioxide concentration in its upward trend. Even if emissions came to a halt altogether, it would likely take hundreds, if not thousands, of years for concentration levels to come back down to desirable rates. Still, tools are in place for governments and industries to turn their backs on fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, the burning of which is causing the emissions, Butler said. Relying on a combination of alternative sources of power would stop emissions in their tracks, Butler said, citing geothermal, hydropower, agropower, wind energy and even controversial nuclear power as potential alternatives. The main obstacle to this end so far seems to be a lack of mass mobilization. “We put a man on the moon in nine years and we could hardly fly a rocket before that,” Butler said, referring to America’s successful Apollo 11 mission in 1969. “With the right kind of political will, there’s a lot that could get done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/28/bid-for-rsa-insurance-uk-zurich-takeover-stephen-hester-shareholders","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T18:39:51Z","webTitle":"One bidder is nice for RSA Insurance – but More Than one would be better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/28/bid-for-rsa-insurance-uk-zurich-takeover-stephen-hester-shareholders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/28/bid-for-rsa-insurance-uk-zurich-takeover-stephen-hester-shareholders","fields":{"headline":"One bidder is nice for RSA Insurance – but More Than one would be better","bodyText":"Here’s a safe prediction: a sale of RSA Insurance to Zurich, or any other foreign bidder, would produce not a single howl of anguish about a great British company being sold overseas. Insurance for cars and homes doesn’t stir patriotic juices like chocolate (Cadbury’s) or pharmaceuticals (AstraZeneca). The industry is utterly unloved on account of a business model that relies on sufficient numbers of punters being too dozy to notice the price rises slipped into renewal quotes. And, in RSA’s case, everybody has always understood that chief executive Stephen Hester’s task is to generate hard value for long-suffering shareholders by whatever means necessary. Zurich has called earlier than some expected, but Hester’s strategy since February 2014 could almost have been designed to declutter RSA and attract a bidder. He launched a rights issue at the outset to buy himself some time, and negotiating room, during a disposal programme. But then he dispatched small units overseas at impressive speed: the Baltics, Poland, Thailand, China, Singapore, Italy and India have gone. Meanwhile, the Irish business has been detoxified after its reserves scandal. Outsiders can now see the attractive parts – the UK, Canada and the Scandinavian operations – more clearly. Perhaps the ideal time to sell would be after another round of self-help measures, meaning cost-cutting. But Zurich is at the door now and the capital demands for all insurers are under regulatory review. Hester will know that the bulk of his shareholders expect him to do his duty: talk to the Swiss and see if the likes of Axa and Allianz wish to play. One bidder is nice; More Than one would be better. Melrose places rivals in shade with Elster sale to Honeywell The Melrose crew make it look disarmingly simple: buy a strong but overweight engineering company, knock it into shape and then sell for a tidy profit. Elster, a meter business being sold to Honeywell for £3.3bn, joins a long list of triumphs from a management team that started its routine at Wassall in the 1990s. There is a fair argument that this deal is one of the best in the collection. Melrose paid a 40% takeover premium to remove Elster from the US stock market for £1.8bn in 2012. Three years later, its equity investment has risen 2.3 times in value and, by way of a cherry, Honeywell is taking not only Elster’s pension fund but also a couple left over from past Melrose deals. What’s the secret? That is the arresting part since Melrose claims to do nothing that other owners could not. For example: give managers direct accountability, close loss-making factories and stop divisions encroaching on each other’s patches. Sceptics detect a whiff of asset-stripping but the record doesn’t show it: investment at Melrose companies tends to exceed depreciation. At least £2bn of the Honeywell cash will be returned to shareholders while management plots the next adventure. It’s a roundabout way to proceed since, once a target is spotted, Melrose will want fresh funds. But the technique keeps the arithmetic clean and gives investors sight of what they’re buying. On this occasion, it may also encourage Melrose to wait for prices in the sector to fall before it makes its next purchase. Elster is departing at 14 times last year’s earnings, which is a fine price only from the seller’s point of view. Biomass, the budget and Drax logic Three weeks after George Osborne’s budget, Drax chief executive Dorothy Thompson remains shocked. The removal of renewable generators’ exemption from the climate change levy was “an about-turn in a well-entrenched policy that has been a key underpinning for renewable investments since 2001”. Fair comment. The 22% decline in Drax’s share price since the budget, notwithstanding Tuesday’s 10% bounce, illustrates the size of the surprise at Osborne’s handiwork. Thus Thompson turned the interim results into an extended plea for the delights of biomass, the fuel gradually replacing coal in Drax’s power station. Transporting wood pellets from North America doesn’t tick every box in the green-energy checklist but Thompson is correct to say that power from biomass has the key benefit of reliability. If there’s a lot of wind and solar capacity on the grid, we will need biomass, or something similar. Whether this argument will be heard by government is anybody’s guess. Official policy is still to continue the madness of underwriting the world’s most expensive nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It makes no sense. Biomass is neither perfectly green nor cheap, but its economics look vastly better than nuclear’s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/may/17/coalition-optimistic-nuclear-power-edf-china","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-17T16:25:00Z","webTitle":"Coalition still 'optimistic' about nuclear power despite EDF and China concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/17/coalition-optimistic-nuclear-power-edf-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/may/17/coalition-optimistic-nuclear-power-edf-china","fields":{"headline":"Coalition still 'optimistic' about nuclear power despite EDF and China concerns","bodyText":"The government has insisted it was still optimistic about plans to build a series of nuclear power stations despite expectations that EDF would delay its timetable for a new reactor at Hinkley Point and concerns that China was losing interest in being a co-investor. \"The UK's new nuclear programme is advancing positively with three projects currently being taken forward by NNB GenCo [EDF], NuGen and Horizon Nuclear Power,\" said the energy minister, Michael Fallon, in response to a select committee report. \"We are confident that we will see investment in the context of the government's policy on no public subsidies for new nuclear.\" He added that negotiations were continuing over a \"strike price\" – or guaranteed minimum price for electricity generated. EDF, which wants a 40-year guarantee, said it remained optimistic that it could tie up a deal with ministers before long. On Friday, the construction trade paper Building quoted industry sources as saying that EDF did not expect to take a final investment decision on Hinkley in Somerset until September at the earliest. The firm, 80% of which is owned by the French state, had originally talked about concluding negotiations by the end of 2012. That was later extended to the first quarter of 2013. Delays have traditionally dogged nuclear energy projects but are particularly worrisome in this case because Britain faces a potential energy capacity crisis within five years. An EDF spokeswoman declined to comment on the latest speculation, saying. \"I am not going to make up dates. Others might have their own views but we have nothing else to add.\" A major slip in the Somerset timetable was one of the reasons British Gas owner Centrica pulled out of its original plans to invest in Hinkley alongside EDF, which the British company highlighted at its annual general meeting on Monday. Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, told shareholders: \"Not only had the cost increased but also the schedule had lengthened very considerably. So instead of taking four to five years to build, EDF were telling us that it was going to take nine to 10 years to build. That is a long time to be writing out a cheque for this project.\" EDF has been struggling with its own soaring £30bn debt levels and delays at its key project in France. The group opened talks with the Chinese as an alternative co-investor and earlier this month signed a formal co-operation deal with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Company. But City sources working for the Chinese told the Guardian they thought it very unlikely they would participate. \"Money is no object but the Chinese have pulled back on nuclear in Britain. They realise they do not have sufficient know-how to pass the UK regulators but do not want to be just a passive investor,\" said one investment banker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jul/03/boris-johnson-faces-backlash-after-joining-cabinet-revolt-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-03T16:17:29Z","webTitle":"Labour accuses Johnson and Tories backing public sector pay rise of hypocrisy - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/03/boris-johnson-faces-backlash-after-joining-cabinet-revolt-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/03/boris-johnson-faces-backlash-after-joining-cabinet-revolt-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Labour accuses Johnson and Tories backing public sector pay rise of hypocrisy - as it happened","bodyText":"Downing Street has insisted that government policy on public sector pay has not changed, despite the policing minister Nick Hurd telling MPs that a pay rise for police is “under active discussion”. Asked about Hurd’s comment, the prime minister’s spokesman said: There are public sector pay review bodies carrying out their work. We are in the process of working through recommendations. That is what the minister was referring to. James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, has given Northern Ireland’s politicians more time to reach a deal on power-sharing. Despite the deadline for the talks being reached without an agreement, he told MPs that he was not quite ready to legislate to enable civil servants to spend money in place of an elected executive. He said: This hiatus cannot continue for much longer. There is no doubt that the best outcome is for a new executive to take those strategic decisions in the interest of all ... If no agreement is reached, legislation in Westminster may then be required to give authority for the expenditure of Northern Ireland departments through an appropriations bill. We have not quite reached that point. That point is coming and the lack of a formal budget is not something that can be sustained indefinitely. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has told MPs 181 tower blocks have now failed fire safety tests for cladding ordered after the Grenfell Tower fire. That amounts to a 100% failure rate, he said. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Javid is responding to Healey. He says the offer is for high quality temporary accommodation. It will be appropriate to their family, and their family size. They will not be forced to move into somewhere they don’t want. Some residents would rather stay in hotels, he says. And some residents would rather move away from the tower. He says temporary accommodation could include hotel accommodation. John Healey, the shadow housing minister, says ministers have been off the pace. They have been too slow to grasp the problem, and too slow to act. He asks how many survivors are still in hotels? Does the promise of good quality temporary accommodation include hotels? He says the fire safety cladding tests are too slow and too narrow. He says if Kensington and Chelsea were a school, it would be in special measures. He urges the government to intervene to restore trust in the council. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is making a Commons statement updating MPs on Grenfell Tower. He starts by running through steps that have already been taken. He says the director of public prosecutions has said there will be no prosecutions for anyone illegally subletting flats at Grenfell Tower. People need to come forward with information about who was living in the tower, he says. He says he looks foward to working with the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea council. The prime minister said everyone who lost their home would get a good quality temporary home within three weeks, he says. He says that promise will be honoured. Some families have decided they would prefer to move away, he says. He says every family will have an offer of temporary accommodation by Wednesday. But they will be given time if they do not want to move immediately, he says. He says 181 tower blocks have now failed fire cladding safety tests. That is a 100% failure rate. Where landlords cannot make the buildings safe, tenants will have to be moved out, he says. He says he has asked for the testing process to be independently reviewed. A team from Sweden reviewed it. They decided the tests were sound, he says. He says a note on this has been put on the gov.uk website (pdf). Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, has written a good post about the Conservative party and public sector pay on his Facebook page. Here’s an extract. Gove and Johnson are officially talking nonsense when suggesting that public sector pay can be increased without raising taxes or fundamentally changing the government’s approach to reducing the deficit. I say that’s official, because it is the unambiguous view of the Office for Budget Responsibility - the government’s own watchdog of its finances ... In other words there is no money behind the back of the sofa to finance an increase in the pay of teachers, nurses, police officers greater than the ordained 1% ceiling. That means the government has two choices: 1) it could finance such pay rises via a £6bn per years or so tax rise, which many Tories would find as palatable as a steaming plate of sick; 2) or it could publicly concede that the Labour party of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell are the economic gurus and have won the fiscal argument - and that too would be as edible for most Tories as an ice cold plate of the same noxious substance. So at a time when this government’s grip on power is tenuous and when the authority of the prime minister is nebulous, Tory MPs may be precisely wrong that giving public sector workers a real pay rise will be the rehabilitation of their party; it could equally confirm to much of the electorate that they stand for precisely nothing of significance. The White House has ruled out President Trump making a surprise visit to the UK when he comes to Europe later this month, the FT reports. Here is the Times’ Patrick Maguire on James Brokenshire’s statement. Brokenshire is responding to Smith. He says Theresa May has been involved in trying to get a deal on power sharing. He says he will put a letter in the Commons library giving details of the proposed legislation for transparency in Northern Ireland with regard to political donations. Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, is responding now. He says he admires Brokenshire for continuing to believe that an executive could be formed. He says he is surprised that Theresa May has not taken personal responsibility for trying to end the deadlock in Northern Ireland. He says an appropriations bill would be seen as direct rule. He hopes it can be avoided. He welcomes the decision to legislate to force parties to declare the sources of political donations. Will the same rules apply in Northern Ireland as apply in the rest of the UK? Brokenshire says the government will continue to govern in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland. He says he stands ready to facilitate the creation of a new power-sharing executive. Brokenshire says the government will not forget its obligation to provide good government. He says some money remains unallocated, to allow an incoming executive to decide who it spends that cash. He says if no agreement is reached, legislation may be required in Westminster to allow money to be spent in Northern Ireland. He says that point has not been reached yet. But it is coming. Money cannot continue to be spent in Northern Ireland without a formal budget. He says he intends to bring forward legislation to bring forward legislation forcing Northern Ireland parties to declare the sources of their funding from 1 July 2017. Brokenshire says government will legislate to force Northern Ireland parties to declare the sources of their funding. James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, is making his Commons statement now. He says that after the Northern Ireland elections in March, the parties in Northern Ireland could not agree a power-sharing administration. Parliament passed legislation to extend the talks deadline until 29 June. That deadline passed without a deal. Since then talks have continued, and some progress has been made, but there is still no deal, he says. He says the prime minister has been involved. I continue to believe that a deal remains achievable. He says since March civil servants have been making decisions in Northern Ireland. But they have not been able to make strategic decisions. This has created uncertainty. This hiatus cannot simply continue for much longer. The department for culture, media and sport (DCMS) has become the department for digital, culture, media and sport, it has announced. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary (or digital secretary, perhaps) said this was because “the department has taken on significant new responsibilities in recent years, so that half of its policy and delivery work now covers the digital sectors - telecommunications, data protection, internet safety, cyber skills and parts of media and the creative industries.” Cunningly, it is going to keep the same acronym, because DCMS used to be Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but now stands for department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.) A DCMS spokesman said the rebranding had cost about £3,000, with costs kept to a minimum because most of the changes to items like letterheads were done digitally. The Labour press statement about the appointment of 20 shadow ministers was relatively straightforward. The party may have missed the true significance of the reshuffle because, according to the Labour party chair Ian Lavery, the appointment of Chris Williamson as a shadow fire services minister signals the death knell of Thatcherism. Lavery said: Chris is a first class MP and a true representative of his constituency. He has a reputation as being no fan of neoliberalism and his appointment is a sign that the days of free market Thatcherism are coming to an end. Lavery and Williamson (who was re-elected this year after losing his Derby North seat narrowly in 2015) are both leftwingers and committed Jeremy Corbyn supporters. The Lavery quote is from a press notice about Williamson’s appointment sent out by a press officer highlighting Williamson’s record on fire safety, including his campaigning for sprinklers. Williamson was shadow fire services minister between 2010 and 2013. The press release also quotes Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, saying: This appointment is exactly what’s needed for our fire services and for our public sector in general. Chris is a tough politician on the issues that matter. He’ll be a minister for ordinary people who want safety, not profit, to be a key driver of public policy. We look forward to working with him. And this is what Nick Hurd, the police minister, told MPs about how a pay rise for police officers was under “active consideration”. He was responding to a question from the shadow Home Office minister Louise Haigh. He said: We want to make sure that frontline public service workers, including the police, are paid fairly for their work, not least because of the contribution that they have made over the years to reducing the deficit that we inherited from the party opposite. And in that the work that they have done to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs. How we do that, in a way that is sustainable and affordable, is under active discussion. In the Commons during Home Office questions Nick Hurd, the police minister, has said that a pay rise for police officers is “under active consideration”, the Daily Mirror’s Jack Blanchard reports. A febrile atmosphere around the Ulster loyalist marching season is hampering moves to reach compromise at the talks aimed at restoring power sharing in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein warned today. Conor Murphy, one of Sinn Fein’s negotiators at the talks in Stormont Castle, said it was a “bizarre situation” that the parties locked in discussions have to take a break because “the atmosphere becomes too hostile for political negotiations.” Murphy claimed it was putting particular pressure on the DUP not to budge on contentious issues like Sinn Fein’s demand for an Irish Language Act. “Now we find ourselves up against the Twelfth of July where the atmosphere becomes so hostile that the DUP are even less likely to move on some of these issues,” Murphy added. The 12th of July when Orange Order members and their supporters commemorate William of Orange’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 is the climax of the Ulster loyalist marching season. A number of leading DUP figures are slated in to speak at Orange demonstrations across Northern Ireland next Wednesday including a several venues with a relatively hardline loyalist audience. Here are some more lines from the World at One interview with Stephen Crabb, the Conservative former work and pension secretary. Crabb said the Conservative party had to show it was on the side of public sector workers. We can’t fight another general election campaign where the Conservartives are seen as the bogeymen when it comes to public sector workers. There are a great many people on the front line of public services ... who do recognise the truth of what it is we are trying to achieve, reducing the deficit, [and] are doing great things in terms of reforming their areas of the public sector. The Conservative party, we need to show that we are on the side of these people. This issue isn’t just one of pay; it is about being seen to be positive about the public sector, backing those public sector workers and managers who are making a difference every day of the week and making our public sector sustainable for the long term. He said that although was not in favour of lifting the 1% pay cap for all public sector workers, he did think it should be lifted for some of them, especially nurses. I lost count of the number of times people said to me on the doorstep, “Well, I wouldn’t mind paying a bit more tax if I knew that it was going into nurses’ pay packets.” I think people feel an enormous amount of sympathy for nursing. He ruled out running in a future leadership contest. He stood in last year’s contest, but came second last out of five, getting just 34 votes from MPs. Asked about standing again, he said: “I’ve been there a year ago. I’m not doing that again.” In the interview he also said that ministers like Boris Johnson should resign if they want to speak out against the government’s public sector pay policy. (See 1.45pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has announced the appointment of 20 shadow ministers. Here is the list in full. Environment David Drew Holly Lynch Home Affairs Nick Thomas Symonds Chris Williamson Afzal Khan Louise Haigh Scotland Paul Sweeney Justice Gloria de Piero Imran Hussain International Development Roberta Blackman Woods Transport Rachael Maskell Karl Turner Treasury Anneliese Dodds Housing Tony Lloyd Melanie Onn Women and equalities Carolyn Harris Defence Gerald Jones Local Government Yvonne Fovargue Education Tracy Brabin Wales Chris Ruane Commenting on the appointments, Corbyn said: I’m delighted to be filling Labour’s shadow front bench with a wealth of talent. Our new shadow ministers will bolster the excellent work of Labour’s shadow cabinet and departmental teams. These appointments are further evidence that Labour is not just the opposition – we are the government in waiting. UPDATE: The Telegraph’s Jack Maidment points out that the Labour press notice misspelt the names of two of the MPs on this list. FURTHER UPDATE: Guido Fawkes has found a third misspelling. Labour and the Lib Dems have accused Boris Johnson and other Tory cabinet ministers calling for a public sector pay rise of hypocrisy. Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron both spoke out because those ministers now calling for the 1% cap on public sector pay rises to be lifted voted against a Labour amendment last week proposing just this. (See 9.41am.) Downing Street says it has not changed its policy on pay and it has played down prospects of any change being announced before the autumn budget. Stephen Crabb, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has said that ministers like Boris Johnson should resign if they want to speak out against the government’s public sector pay policy. In an interview on the World at One, Crabb said: I don’t think it’s a great sight seeing different cabinet members giving slightly different messages to the media. My own personal preference is that people should be direct and upfront. If they want to take a position that is different from that of the official government line, then they should not be in the cabinet ... Until we get to the point when specific decisions are being made [on public sector pay], I do think that if you are in the cabinet, if you are taking the government’s shilling, then you need to stick rigidly to the government line. Earlier Lord Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor, also criticised ministers like Johnson for undermining the Treasury on this issue. I will post more from Crabb’s interview soon. The cost of building the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point has risen by £1.5bn, it has been announced. As the Press Association reports, the French energy giant EDF said it will now cost £19.6bn to build the site in Somerset. The news follows a review of the costs and timetable of the project, undertaken after EDF’s final investment decision last September. Commenting on the announcement, the SNP MSP Gillian Martin said: This latest increase in the total cost of this project shows just how disastrous Hinkley Point is turning out to be. It was always going to be a white elephant - but this is becoming clearer by the week, as costs continue to sky rocket to over £20bn after it was slammed by the National Audit Office for being ‘not value for money’. Ahead of Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire’s House of Commons statement around 4.30pm which will bring the curtain down on the latest round of talks to restore power sharing back in Belfast, the nationalist SDLP made an 11th hour appeal that failure to cut a dead won’t lead to direct rule. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, said: It is utterly exasperating that after months of talks, the DUP and Sinn Fein continue to lock our politics into a complete stalemate. Kicking the can further down the road, will rightly be met with public anger and disappointment. As the secretary of state prepares to make his statement today, I urge him to ensure that direct rule is not the price that the people of Northern Ireland will have to pay for the political failure of the big two. I would also urge the Irish government to fully exert its responsibility and role to ensure that the North is not placed at the mercy of a Tory/DUP coalition. In the continuing absence of a local assembly, the Irish government must be centrally involved in order to retain the hard won political balance which underpins Northern politics. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News a few minutes ago that putting up public sector pay cost roughly an extra £2bn for every extra 1% that people received. He said that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, could afford to put pay up a bit, by borrowing more, because his deficit reduction target gave him some flexibility. But he said that Hammond would have to prioritise. He told the programme: Actually, within the scale of things, you can afford a few billion here or there. But you can’t keep affording a few billion on top of a few billion on top of a few billion. And I guess the thing that the chancellor is going to be worrying about is not ‘Can I afford £2bn, £3bn, £4bn, even £5bn for public sector pay?’ It’s going to be, ‘Well, if I give it for this, they are going to come back for something else and something else.’ So what I would like to see, really, is the chancellor in the autumn budget set out some priorities. Say, ‘Yes, I am willing to spend and borrow a bit more, and this is why my priorities are perhaps for some public pay here, and perhaps for something else over there.’ His worry is that the pressure is just coming here, there and everywhere. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street has refused to say whether or not the government backs Labour calls for commissioners to be sent in to take charge of Kensington and Chelsea council. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, will make a statement to MPs about Grenfell Tower at 3.30pm. Theresa May is also chairing a meeting of the Grenfell Tower taskforce this afternoon. Number 10 played down the prospect of any early announcement about public sector pay. “There’s a budget in the autumn,” the prime minister’s spokesman said, when asked when a further statement might come. He said the government had already responded to some public sector pay body reports (covering nurses, doctors and dentists and the armed forces, who are getting a 1% increase in 2017-18) and that it would respond to others in due course. The spokesman would not explicitly rule out re-opening the 2017-18 pay settlements, but he said that recommendations for 2017-18 had already been accepted, suggesting that retrospective pay rises are unlikely. The spokesman said Ofgem’s plans to extend a price cap for vulnerable customers was “a step in the right direction”. In their election manifesto the Conservatives went much further, proposing a price cap that would affect 17m customers. Asked if the government would implement that plan, the spokesman said: Ofgem’s response is a step in the right direction. We’ve said we need a better energy market and are committed to extending price protection currently in place to some vulnerable energy consumers to more people on the poorest-value tariffs. We are not ruling anything out, whether that is action by the regulator or legislation. The spokesman dismissed criticism of May’s plans to force internet companies to remove extremist content from Max Hill QC, the independent reviewer of terror legislation. As the Guardian reports, Hill told a conference: I struggle to see how it would help if our parliament were to criminalise tech company bosses who ‘don’t do enough’. How do we measure ‘enough’? What is the appropriate sanction? We do not live in China, where the internet simply goes dark for millions when government so decides. Our democratic society cannot be treated that way. But the spokesman said the government was still interested in the idea of creating a law that would lead to companies like Facebook being fined if they do not remove extremist content. He said: We do not want the internet to be a safe space for extremist content. The spokesman said he was “not aware” of any plans for President Trump to visit the UK later this month. Asked about reports that Trump is planning a surprise visit, the spokesman said: I’m not aware of any plans for the president to visit the UK in the next few weeks ... We have extended an invitation [to Trump for a state visit] that has been accepted and we will set out plans in due course. The Number 10 lobby briefing is over. It was not particularly illuminating, but I will post a summary soon. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is making a Commons statement this afternoon about Grenfell Tower. Asked if the government backed Labour’s call for commissioners to be sent in to run Kensington and Chelsea council, the prime minister’s spokesman said that Javid would be making a statement later and that there was a limit to what Downing Street could say because Javid had to operate in a “quasi-judicial” capacity, so it is possible that there could be an announcement on this this afternoon. How much would it cost to lift the 1% cap on public sector pay increases? This report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (pdf) puts provides some figures. The key table is this one. The IFS has estimated how much extra the Treasury would have to spend to implement the Labour and Lib Dem manifesto plans for public sector pay, compared with the Conservative manifesto plans (keeping the cap). The Lib Dems said they would increase public sector pay in line with inflation. Labour said it would lift the public sector pay cap, and shadow ministers implied this meant accepting pay review body recommendations. The IFS says this latter plan would cost more than £9bn a year by the end of this parliament (2021-22.) Here’s an extract from the IFS briefing. In 2016, the public sector paybill (excluding nationalised corporations) was £179bn. This includes the wages and salaries of public sector workers, the employer national insurance contributions, and employers’ pension contributions towards public service pension schemes. With such a large paybill, even small percentage increases can lead to significant increases in the cost of employing public sector workers. [The table above] shows the estimated increase in employment costs to central and local government as a result of the Labour and Liberal Democrat plans, compared with the current Conservative government’s policy of 1% increases until 2019–20. These costs include the amount that public sector employers would need to pay in terms of higher employer national insurance and pension contributions. The figures therefore show the extra amount that departments and local government would need to receive in funding to pay for the higher wage bill, without having to make any offsetting cuts either to the size of the workforce or to non-wage costs. I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Cleaners, porters and security staff at four London hospitals are to stage a three-day strike in a dispute over pay, the Press Association reports. Members of Unite at Barts Health NHS Trust employed by Serco, will walk out on Tuesday, followed by a seven-day stoppage from July 11 and a 14-day strike starting on July 25. Further strike action will also be planned for August and September. Gloria Sindall, Unite regional officer, said: Workers across four London hospitals will be taking strike action this week in a battle against low pay. Cleaners, porters and security staff have seen their real living standards drop year on year. Workers are now demanding a 30p per hour wage increase. Serco made over £80m in profit last year but managers are refusing to share these earnings fairly and protect the living standards of the workers. Rather than try to settle this dispute the private contractor Serco wasted valuable time by offering absolutely nothing new for the workforce at talks with Acas last week. Unite members are fed up and are preparing for a series of strikes to demand a fair and proper pay rise which recognises the contribution they make to Serco and to Barts. Northern Ireland’s politicians are to be given further time to reach an agreement that could bring back power sharing government to the region, it emerged today. Unionist sources at the negotiations in Stormont Castle said the Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire is likely to put the talks process into “warm storage” rather than immediately reimpose direct rule from London. Senior civil servants would run devolved ministries in Belfast over the summer while the main parties represented in the Northern Ireland assembly would be back in August to resume their discussions, they said. The British government has already pushed the talks through the official legal deadline set by Brokenshire of 29 June. It is now thought both governments in London and Dublin would prefer to create breathing space around the 12th of July - the climax of the Ulster loyalist marching season - and throughout the month before bringing the parties together again. Brokenshire is scheduled to outline the government’s thinking in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon. The main issue of contention overall is still Sinn Fein’s demand for an Irish Language Act. The party wants this act to be a “stand alone” one, which means that the legislation would only concern the rights of Irish speakers and putting the gaelic language on an equal par in law to English. The DUP, meanwhile, fearing criticism from more hard-line unionists have argued for a more all embracing Culture Act that would not only guarantee the rights of those who speak Irish but also Ulster Scots speakers as well as incorporating the protection of Orange/Protestant culture into legislation. DUP sources told The Guardian on Monday morning that one idea being floated within their party was for the Northern Ireland Secretary to announce that the salaries of assembly members would be temporarily cut if politicians fail to secure a deal. “The feeling that the public are outraged that politicians are still getting paid even though the assembly is not sitting, there is no executive and no business is being done. Even a 50% pay cut over the hiatus before talks resume would be an important gesture to the people out there,” one Democratic Unionist source said. Bank of England workers are to stage a four-day strike in a dispute over pay, the Press Association reports. Members of Unite will walk out from July 31, the first strike at the bank in over 50 years. The announcement follows a 95% vote in favour of industrial action. Unite members working in the maintenance, parlours and security departments will be taking strike action on July 31, August 1, 2 and 3. The union warned that if the bank fails to resolve the pay row it will be consulting its members across other departments as part of a plan to escalate the dispute. The Labour peer Stewart Wood, who was a key policy adviser to Ed Miliband, has an interesting Twitter thread on the Conservatives and public sector pay. But Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said on Twitter that Boris Johnson and the other Tory public sector pay rise advocates were “utterly shameless” because they voted against the Labour amendment to the Queen’s speech on Wednesday saying the pay cap should be lifted. Jeremy Corbyn made the same point on Twitter last night. And Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, also accused the Tories of hypocrisy on this issue. The Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, a former nurse, told the Today programme that she thought public sector workers did deserve a pay rise. She said: [Nursing is] a difficult, stressful, responsible job and if people aren’t paid enough so they can make ends meet they will go and do something else. I think there is resentment building and not just in nursing, but across the public sector, that frontline staff have carried these services for the last seven years and if there is no recognition of that and no pay coming forward to recognise that then that’s when the resentment builds. On Twitter Stephen Crabb, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, said she had made a “compelling case”. This morning Radio 4 has been leading the news with the Guardian’s revelation that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has joined those Conservative MPs and cabinet ministers calling for the 1% cap on public sector pay rises to be lifted. As the Guardian reports, he thinks it can be done “in a responsible way and without causing fiscal pressures [ie, tax rises]”. Perhaps that £350m a week from the EU will cover it. The Guardian’s story is interesting for at least four reasons. 1 - With pressure growing like this, it seems more and more likely that the cap will be lifted. 2 - It is yet more evidence that, on austerity, Labour is winning the public argument. 3 - The fact that an increasing number of cabinet ministers are merrily briefing away that they want the cap to go, even though Number 10 tried to rule this out on Wednesday afternoon, shows just how little authority Theresa May has over her senior ministers. 4 - And it is suggests that a covert, long-term leadership campaign is underway. The Today programme has a feature on code-breaking this morning. I was mystified by their puzzle, but I can decode: “The foreign secretary supports the idea of public-sector workers getting a better pay deal.” It means Boris wants to be PM. Here is the Guardian’s story. Boris Johnson was echoing what his Vote Leave ally Michael Gove, the new environment secretary, was saying about pay on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday (pdf). According to the BBC, at least six cabinet ministers have now said, either publicly or via proxies, that they favour lifting the pay cap. But they have provoked a backlash. On the Today programme this morning Lord Lamont, the Conservative former chancellor, criticised Johnson, Gove and the others for their stance. He told the programme. What concerns me is that there seems to be growing in the Conservative party, and among ministers, a feeling that because the electorate disliked austerity, that this is the message that has come back, and therefore it ought to be discarded. People are talking about austerity as though it was an issue of too many repeats on television, or they had got tired of watching Poldark and wanted a better programme. This is not a choice. It is unavoidable that we have restraint on public spending. People may not remember the fact that there was this severe financial crisis in 2007-08. The shadow of it is still with us. Therefore, because the stock of debt is still at a very high level indeed, 86% of GDP, if there were another slowdown in the economy, if there were another financial crisis, if interest rates were to go up - and interest rates are likely to go up - all this poses severe problems for the government ... The control of public sector pay is extremely important. It is roughly half of current expenditure, and about 30% of total public expenditure. It come to £200bn plus a year. You’ve got to have a restraint on that ... I think it is not right for cabinet ministers to gang up on the chancellor in this way. I think it is making his position, which is always very difficult, very very awkward indeed. And I do think just to say because a lot of voters in the election objected to what is called austerity, we must abandon it - the fatal flaw in the Conservative campaign in the election was they didn’t make the case ... they didn’t play their strongest card, which is actually their economic competence. Former senior civil servants have also criticised those Tories backing public sector pay rises without saying how those should be funded. This is from Simon Fraser, who used to be permanent secretary at the Foreign Office. And this is from Nick Macpherson, who used to be permanent secretary at the Treasury. I will post more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 12.30pm: The Labour MP David Lammy gives a speech on his review of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. 12.30pm: The Institute for Government holds a briefing on the repeal bill. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives a statement on the deadlock in Northern Ireland over attempts to reform the power-sharing executive. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

Mark Carney, speaking in Oxford University’s ornate Sheldonian theatre, stressed the “dynamism” EU membership has unleashed in the British economy over the past four decades, and the benefits we have won from the four freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome – free movement of capital, labour, goods and services. His speech was accompanied by a weighty tome from the Bank, running to 100 pages and covering everything from the benefits of immigration to the joys of free trade. That came just a day after the CBI had published its own glossy document on the joys of EU membership, stressing the free access it brings to a consumer market of 500 million people. It even includes a picture of a fridge stuffed with imported delicacies from our EU partners. The accompanying text reads: “Customers in the UK have a wider choice of goods and can buy cheese from France, salami from Italy, beer from Belgium and put it in a fridge from Germany as if they were buying from the UK with no extra charges,” the text said. A string of Europhile CBI members, from the chief executive of BT Group to the boss of small, independent Somerset cheese producer Wyke, explain how the EU has helped them to succeed – against a glossy red, white and blue background. Yet in some ways, despite its huge importance for the future of the British economy, this remains a phoney war, because voters still do not know what concessions David Cameron is going to bring back from Brussels – or even precisely what demands he’s planning to make of his EU partners during the forthcoming “renegotiation”. Carney, who likes to make a splash, may have overstressed the EU’s past benefits; the firmly anti-EU Lord Lawson, leader of the Conservative no campaign, expressed his fury that the governor had seen fit to speak out. But the truth is, rather than helping voters to make up their minds, the Bank – and in its own way, the CBI – were preparing Cameron for battle. The governor’s praise for the EU was backward-looking, and came tempered with a warning that the UK’s openness, and its oversized financial sector, have made it particularly vulnerable to shocks transmitted from the EU – such as the Greek sovereign debt crisis. And as the eurozone member countries press ahead with economic integration – something the UK supports, in the hope that it will prevent another meltdown – the Bank fears that non-eurozone members will be disadvantaged, and that UK regulators will lose the discretion they need to fend off future financial challenges. The worry is that the new rules will increasingly be written to suit the members of the single currency, rather than all the member of the single European market. Carney urged Cameron to seek ways of safeguarding Britain’s interests. The CBI said Britain would be better off inside a “reformed” EU. But neither of them was prepared to say what action they would recommend should the prime minister come back all but empty-handed – and indeed, Bank insiders stressed that they would not be prepared to “mark the government’s homework”. The real decision voters will have to make when the referendum is called will depend on what kind of EU is likely to evolve over the coming decades, not the benefits that have accrued in the past. It will also depend on impossible-to-fathom variables about what kind of deal the UK could hope to negotiate after Brexit – and here, the analysis provided by business groups and central bankers gives out. This battle has a long way yet to run. Moving issues for HSBC Another week, another victory on the regulatory front for Britain’s big banks. The Competition and Markets Authority, to a storm of protest from smaller challenger banks, decided it was not interested in structural reform. There will be no break-up of the big boys. Instead, the regulator will seek ways to try to prompt customers to shop around. The CMA’s vote for minor remedies continued a winning run for the big lenders, especially the international banks. In his summer budget, chancellor George Osborne restructured the bank levy and introduced a surcharge on profits. The net result: the likes of HSBC will pay less. And on ringfencing – centrepiece of the post-crisis reforms – senior managers at big banks will not have to show they took reasonable steps to avoid catastrophe; the burden of proof will lie with the regulator. Given three favourable results in a row, you might have assumed the directors of HSBC would have decided that, on reflection, the UK is not such a bad place to have your global headquarters. Instead, the review of whether to stay in London continues. Indeed, it was enlivened last week by an FT story that the US is a possibility; it had been assumed that Hong Kong, where HSBC has its roots, was the only rival to London. The idea of HSBC contemplating a move to the US is extraordinary. The bank doesn’t have many political friends there, and operates under a deferred prosecution agreement after admitting in 2012 to laundering money for Mexican and Colombian drug lords. The US was also the scene of the worst acquisition in its history – sub-prime lender, Household, in 2003. UK politicians, by contrast, seem to be falling over themselves to keep HSBC here. Surely we have reached the point where backroom pleading with HSBC’s directors, plus generous regulatory treatment, has reached its natural limit. If HSBC’s directors prefer undemocratic China or an unfriendly US, let them try their luck. Still time to change tack on solar power If the government does not want to rethink its solar strategy in the wake of attacks by Boris Johnson, numerous backbench MPs and the renewable industry, then the situation remains an astonishing defeat for common sense. George Osborne and energy secretary Amber Rudd can still create some kind of compromise on an 87% subsidy cut to defray the criticism. But it will be worthless unless they vastly increase the size of the £7m cash pot that is left over the next three years. Last week saw the end of the consultation on changes to the aid regime that would kill off the private sector solar industry in the UK, just as the government hails a 35-year subsidy scheme for a Chinese and French-backed nuclear power plant. Whether it is a sign of Tory predilections for old technology over new or a ministerial addiction to big legacy projects, the attack on solar is a mistake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jun/21/queens-speech-2017-theresa-may-promises-humility-and-resolve-as-she-publishes-legislative-programme-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-21T19:50:33Z","webTitle":"Queen's speech 2017: Dodds tells Commons DUP 'will vote to strengthen union' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jun/21/queens-speech-2017-theresa-may-promises-humility-and-resolve-as-she-publishes-legislative-programme-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jun/21/queens-speech-2017-theresa-may-promises-humility-and-resolve-as-she-publishes-legislative-programme-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Queen's speech 2017: Dodds tells Commons DUP 'will vote to strengthen union' – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from us today - thanks for reading and do join us again on Thursday. For all of the day’s political stories click here for the Guardian’s Politics page. Of the interviews Boris Johnson has done tonight, the toughest was with Eddie Mair on BBC Radio 4’s PM in which he struggled to explain the key points of the Queen’s speech, repeatedly pausing and saying “hang on a second” as he could be heard rifling through papers. Johnson was asked about what measures the speech contained to tackle the “burning injustices” that have been identified by Theresa May. Mair began by asking the MP what the Queen’s Speech would do to tackle discrimination against black people in the criminal justice system - a problem identified by the prime minister when she took office last year. Johnson replied hesitantly: “Well, there are measures, I believe, in the bill on the courts which I think is supposed to address some of those issues. I think one thing in particular that we are looking at is measures to ... hang on a second ... there are all sorts of measures that we want to take to ensure that we do not discriminate against everybody.” Theresa May faces a fresh constitutional battle with the Scottish government after conceding that the Holyrood parliament could be allowed to vote on her Brexit plans. Speaking as she debated the Queen’s speech at Westminster, the prime minister said her government was considering whether to offer Holyrood the right to vote on the repeal bill that will enact the UK’s departure from the EU. Scotland’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, warned May that his government would ask the Scottish parliament to vote against that so-called legislative consent motion unless it was happy with its main measures. That threatens to open up a series of conflicts between Westminster and Holyrood over which powers and policies now controlled in Brussels would be handed to Holyrood, and to the devolved parliaments in Cardiff and Stormont, and which would be kept in Whitehall. More here: Boris Johnson has had a busy evening - as well as Sky News he’s also been on Radio 4’s PM and now Channel 4 News, where he claimed that Brexit could be finalised in two years with no transitional deal. “What I certainly think we can do is get the best of both worlds,” the foreign secretary said. That would mean “frictionless, tariff-free trade”, while “also being able to do free trade deals”. On Tuesday chancellor Philip Hammond stressed the importance of transitional arrangements to avoid a “cliff edge” Brexit, including the maintenance of “frictionless” customs union border arrangements for an “implementation period” after leaving the EU. But Johnson said today: “I think we have got to come out of the customs union.” Asked if that meant in 2019 he said “yes”, but added: “Obviously there will be discussion about how long it will take to get the free trade deal. I think you can do it fast.” Johnson, regarded by some as a potential successor to Theresa May, insisted he was not about to challenge her for the Tory leadership. Asked if he was ruling out standing for the leadership until Brexit was delivered in 2019, he said: “Yes, we have got to get on and deliver on the priorities of the people.” Emmanuel Macron has given his first interview since being elected as French president last month. He tells the Guardian and seven other European papers that “pragmatism will determine our new relationship” with Britain. Asked if the door really remained open for Britain to go back on Brexit – after his recent remarks, taken as an encouraging sign by opponents of a hard Brexit, that there may be room for compromise – Macron said: “The door is open until the moment you walk through it. It’s not up to me to say it’s closed. But from the moment things are engaged with a timescale and an objective, it’s very hard to go back, we can’t lie to ourselves.” Macron was firm on the Brexit negotiation process that began this week. He said: “I want the discussions that have just started to be perfectly coordinated at a European level. I do not want bilateral discussions, because the interests of the EU must be preserved in the short, medium and long term.” Some interesting comments on Brexit from Andrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary and MP for Sutton Coldfield. Speaking in the Queen’s speech debate in the Commons, he calls for an end to “undue noises off” about Brexit negotiations so that David Davis can get on with it undisturbed. However, he then adds that the scope should be widened so business can to contribute their expertise to the Brexit talks. And in a slightly sinister tone, Mitchell reminds his Tory colleagues that if there is seen to be an economic cost to the country from Brexit, “the eyes of the electorate will narrow” and the consequences at the ballot box will be severe. A rare cross-party tribute in the Queen’s speech debate in the Commons. Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, paid tribute for former chancellor George Osborne for introducing a “sugar tax” before he decided to step down as an MP earlier this year. Vaz also quipped: “He’s not gone to the other place ... but a higher place - the editorship of the London Evening Standard.” Dodds says the DUP is about strengthening the union, delivering Brexit, defending the country and creating prosperity for Northern Ireland. He ends his speech by saying his party will therefore act and vote in accordance with those goals over the next five years of this parliament. Dodds tells the House: “Strengthening the union must be one of the overarching aims of this government.” The country has voted for Brexit and this parliament must deliver it, Dodds says. He welcomes the drive to find sensible solutions to problems such as land border with the republic. When people voted for Brexit, they voted to leave the single market and the customs union, and Nothern Ireland must do likewise, he says. There cannot be borders between Northern Ireland and rest of UK, and the DUP wants “as frictionless a border as possible” with the republic. Dodds begins by saying it is “sad” that some elected MPs from Northern Ireland do not take up their seats in Westminster and represent their constituents accordingly. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s Westminster leader and MP for North Belfast, has just started speaking in the Commons. More from Boris Johnson, who tells Sky News that no one is pretending that the Tories got the election result we wanted. Neither was there everything in the Queen’s speech the the government would have liked, but he maintained that the legislative programme was still “very considerable”. The foreign secretary also said the government has to get Brexit “done well” and that people need to be “more positive and optimistic” about the UK’s prospects once the country leaves the European Union because those prospects are “considerable”. Johnson also seemed to suggest that the controversial visit by President Donald Trump will go ahead later this year. He says a date was not mentioned in the Queen’s speech today because a date is yet to be agreed with the White House. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been on Sky News and Beth Rigby, Sky’s chief political correspondent, tweets: Number 10 has said that some parts of what used to be called the “great repeal bill” (in the Queen’s speech it is just the “repeal bill”) will need legislative consent in Scotland. That would mean the Scottish parliament getting to vote on them. This is a consequence of what is known as the Sewel convention, which says the Westminter parliament should not legislate on matters devolved to Scotland without the Scottish parliament’s approval. Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun’s political editor, responded by tweeting this. William Bain, a former shadow Scottish secretary, took issue with him. Newton Dunn then clarified the position with this tweet. However, it is not entirely clear what would happen if the Scottish parliament tried to block aspects of the “repeal bill”. This Commons briefing paper (pdf) says Westminster could over-ride the Scottish parliament. If, as the white paper implies, the bill provides for a continuing effect in respect of EU law on devolved matters, then this would imply that consent motions would be required from the devolved legislatures so long as the government chooses to abide by the Sewel convention. This is because the UK parliament would still be legislating on devolved matters, even though the effect would be to preserve the status quo. Equally if, on the other hand, the bill changed any existing EU law on devolved matters, then it would also be doing something that usually brings the Sewel convention into play. However, the Sewel convention, even in its statutory form, includes a rider that the government will not “normally” legislate with regard to devolved matters without consent. The briefing also says the supreme court in the article 50 case ruled that the Sewel convention was not legally binding. The court said it was “a political convention that does not give rise to a legal obligation that can be enforced in the courts.” That’s all from me for today. My colleague Chris Johnston is taking over now. Downing Street claims that the Salisbury convention - which says the Lords will not vote against measures in the manifesto of the governing party - will apply to the Queen’s speech. The prime minister’s official spokesman told journalists: The convention reflects the primacy of the House of Commons as the elected chamber. The view of government lawyers is, as it stands, the Salisbury convention would apply in relation to the manifesto and the House of Lords. The abolition or radical slashing of air passenger duty (APD) is back on the agenda in the Democratic Unionist-Tory negotiations aimed at putting a minority Conservative government in power. DUP and airline sources in Northern Ireland confirmed on Wednesday that APD is one of the demands the Ulster party is making in its discussions with both Downing Street and Treasury officials. Graham Keddie, the managing director of Belfast international airport, said the removal of the tax would have a profoundly positive effect on the local economy. All three of the region’s airports – BelfastiInternational, George Best/Belfast City and City of Derry airport – have to complete with Dublin airport, which has no APD because it was abolished in the Irish Republic. Keddie said: I’m delighted the DUP realises the harm that the tax is doing, and is working to persuade the government to do what’s right. Mrs Foster and her negotiating team have our wholehearted backing, and my hope must be that they are successful. A reduced APD would help us compete more effectively with the Republic of Ireland. Airlines would add very significant additional capacity into the market and more than 1,000 new jobs would be created. APD is putting a brake on further substantial investment by airlines but if the tax was cut or, ideally, axed, we’d see a massive increase in passenger numbers. That, in turn, would push us up the rankings where new airline and route possibilities would be opened up not only for Northern Ireland passengers, but passengers from the entire northern half of the island of Ireland. We await developments in London with keen interest. Airline industry sources believe the total abolition of APD would bring a million new passengers through local airports and create more than 1,000 new jobs. The most perceptive intervention came from the Labour MP Toby Perkins. Comparing the MPs returning to parliament with pupils returning to school after the summer holidays, he told Theresa May: I couldn’t help but notice, as the prime minister and the leader of the opposition went off to listen to the humble address, to think back to when I was at school and I didn’t see people for six weeks. And then they came back and you thought ‘has she shrunk, or has he grown?’ The answer, obviously, is both, but Jeremy Corbyn was the figure who seemed most transformed. Until the general election campaign his performance in the Commons as Labour leader had been mixed. He had had some good PMQs, but his speeches in debates had generally been underwhelming. Today, as a direct result of what happened in the election, he was a much more substantial figure. You might argue that the sort of things he was saying this afternoon were the things he was saying 12 months ago, but your standing as a politician depends on whether people are listening to your arguments and taking them seriously, and today that was happening in a way it just wasn’t before It helped that his speech was polished, with all the anger of his campaign rallies distilled into parliamentary language, and a nice, withering passage about the emptiness of the Queen’s speech. This will be the first parliament in which Corbyn is sure to be a commanding figure. And May, obviously, is diminished. But not totally crushed. With expectations low, she actually managed to strike the right note. She offered a proper apology to the Grenfell Tower survivors. She said at one point she was speaking with “humility”. (Number 10 press released this last night, but there was some doubt as to whether she would actually say it.) She told a self-deprecating joke about her failure to win a majority. And she took a great many interventions. In the Sun on Monday, Trevor Kavanagh, the paper’s well-connected former political editor, said that May “tearful and distraught, doesn’t want to stay” and that her husband “can’t bear to see her suffering”. But she did not look like that this afternoon; she was “just about managing”, to coin a phrase. What was really, striking, though is how the comprehensively the May project has collapsed. At one point she launched into an argument she has used many times before about how the EU referendum was a vote for change and how she wanted to make the country work for everyone. There was a genuine, “red Tory” May agenda that went with this (even if, when she was forced to make hard policy choices, she could not always deliver). But Mayism has now disappeared, because there was none of this left in what was, essentially, a lowest common denominator Queen’s speech. May must know this, although in her speech today she claimed otherwise. It all smacked of wishful thinking. May is winding up now. She says Britain has faced tough challenges before and thrived. The Queen’s speech will not solve every problem. Not every problem can be solved by an act of parliament. But this government is determined to build a better future, she says. And that’s it. Her speech is over. I will be posting more on the Corbyn and May speeches shortly. May says she will not be following Labour’s policies. There is nothing fair about punitive taxes that cost jobs and push up prices. And there is nothing fair about wracking up debts for the next generation, she says. This is from the Independent’s John Rentoul. And this is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. John Penrose, a Conservative, asks May for an assurance that she will press ahead with plans for a cap on energy bills. May says she is determined to address the issue of energy prices. Labour’s Kevin Brennan calls May the “interim prime minister”. He asks how May can negotiate Brexit with the EU if she cannot negotiate a deal with the 10 DUP MPs. May ignores the DUP point and pays tribute to David Davis’s work as Brexit secretary. Labour’s Wes Streeting says May turned the election into a vote on her leadership. Since she did not win a majority, when will she go? May points out that the Tories got more votes than Labour. The Green party’s Caroline Lucas congratulates Theresa May for turning up, unlike during the election, when she did not turn up to the leaders’ debates. Yet there is nothing about climate change in the Queen’s speech. Is that because she has been influenced by the DUP “dinosaurs”. The DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson uses a point of order to complain about Lucas calling the DUP “dinosaurs”. He says the DUP’s energy policy represents what people in Northern Ireland want. John Bercow, the Speaker, says the term “dinosaur” is not unparliamentary. He says dinosaurs survived for very many years. May says the EU referendum vote was not just a vote to leave the EU. It was a vote to change the way the country is run. She says this Queen’s speech marks the beginning of a programme to make sure the country works for everyone. May says “with humility and resolve” she will attempt to tackle the problems facing the country in the national interest. She says she took action on stop and search, even though Labour did not. And she says the government is committed to a racial disparities audit. May says it is good that more young people voted in the general election, even if they did not vote for her party. She says that Jeremy Corbyn fought a spirited campaign, and came a good second. The Labour MP Toby Perkins says he recalls being at school. You would come back after the holidays and look at other people and think, ‘Has he shrunk or have they grown?” May chooses not to respond. May pays tribute to Jo Cox and Sir Gerald Kaufman, the two MPs who died over the past year. And she thanks Richard Benyon and Kwasi Kwarteng for their speeches. Kwarteng wrote a book about the first female prime minister’s worst six months. His next book (about May’s worst six months) may be longer, she jokes. The “day of rage” protest is getting a little tense, according to the Mirror’s Andy Lines. May turns to Grenfell Tower. She says the support offered to families afterwards was not adequate. That was a failure by the state, local and national, she says. She apologises for that. (May said on Saturday that the response to Grenfell Tower was “not good enough”, but at the No 10 briefing yesterday her spokesman refused to say whether May was referring to central government as well as local government when she made that comment. Now she is accepting central government – ie, her government – was at fault.) UPDATE: Here is the full quote. Labour’s Pat McFadden asks May if she accepts that abolishing control orders when she was home secretary was a mistake. May says control orders, introduced by Labour, were increasingly being knocked down by the courts. The government replaced them with Tpims (terrorism investigation and prevention measures) and those have been enhanced. The government will now look at giving the police further powers, she says. Labour’s Seema Malhotra asks May if she will reverse police cuts. May says she has protected counter-terrorism policing, and is spending more on armed police. And she says the government protected police budgets. (Malhotra is speaking about the period from 2010. May is talking about from 2015. That is why their comments appear to contradict each other.) Theresa May is speaking now. She starts by offering her best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh. And she joins Jeremy Corbyn in condemning the attack at Finsbury Park. She praises Corbyn, who is the local MP, for working through the night to deal with it. She summarises the proposals in the Queen’s speech to tackle extremism. Maria Miller, a Conservative, uses a point of order to complain about Corbyn not taking interventions. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Conservative, says Corbyn said some time ago that he was winding up, but has not finished. Jeremy Corbyn says he has taken questions from Tory and Labour MPs. He says Labour will obstruct the government. It is a government in waiting with a policy programme. And that’s it. Corbyn says Labour would end austerity by making different choices. It would ask big business and the rich to pay a little more. Austerity is a choice. It is a choice to make life worse for the many to protect the lifestyle of a few, he says. Austerity and inequality are choices, they are not necessities; they are not unfortunate outcomes. They are a choice to make life worse for the many to maintain the privilege of the few. He says this is a government without a majority, without a mandate, without a programme, led by a prime minister trying to stitch together a deal to keep her government together. Corbyn asks if the government’s domestic violence plans include restoring legal aid for victims. Will the government abandon the public sector pay cap? Some nurses have been forced to use food banks, he says. Public servants and those earning below the living wage deserve better. Labour won almost 13m votes, he says. That is because it offered hope. Theresa May said she would have lost the election if she lost just six seats. But she lost four times that many to Labour alone. Corbyn says by no stretch can the government be described as strong and stable. If you want to improve pay, the best way to do that is to have effective trade unions. So Labour would repeal the Trade Union Act, he says. Corbyn says what happened in Grenfell Tower is terrifying. It shows what happens when you cut local authority spending to the bone. He says the residents were ignored when they raised questions about fire safety, and ignored by a Conservative-controlled council. We cannot have public housing and public services on the cheap, he says. John Prescott, the Labour former deputy prime minister, thinks Corbyn is being treated as a prime ministerial figure. Corbyn says the last home secretary (Theresa May) accused the police of crying wolf when they complained about police cuts. He says he hopes the prime minister will undo the mistakes made by the previous home secretary. Police budgets have suffered a £2.3bn cut in recent years, he says. He says firefighters did an outstanding job at Grenfell Tower. But they worked very long hours, because their numbers have been cut by 600. He says Boris Johnson cut their numbers when he was mayor of London. He asks for an assurance that the government will make emergency funds available to enable councils to check cladding and install sprinklers. Corbyn says the Human Rights Act must remain completely intact. Labour wants powers over agriculture repatriated from Brussels to be given to the devolved assemblies. Corbyn asks May to update MPs on whether President Trump will visit the UK any time this year, or any time in the future. Asked what Labour’s position is on the single market and the customs union, Corbyn says it has been absolutely clear; he wants tariff-free access to the single market. Corbyn says the UK is leaving the EU. But the government could have opened negotiations on a better footing by guaranteeing EU citizens the right to stay. He hopes the government will consult parliament more. Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP, asks Corbyn to rule out a second referendum on Brexit. Corbyn says he would negotiate an exit deal and then bring it back to the Commons. No deal is not better than a bad deal, he says. He says having no deal would be a very bad deal. Immigration policy must be decided by what the economy needs. It should not be determined by Lynton Crosby’s “dog-whistle” politics, or by hate campaigns run by sections of our national press who are so patriotic they are based in tax havens. Corbyn is now thanking the two MPs who gave the opening speeches. He tells Benyon that his mother was at Greenham Common, and that he visited her there. He jokes about being glad Benyon had time to be here. Benyon was able to take time off from looking after his property, he says. (Benyon is a major landowner.) Turning to the Queen’s speech, he says it would be a thin Queen’s speech for a one year session. But it is supposed to cover two years. Corbyn says he welcomes what is not in it. There is no mention of abandoning the triple lock, or taking the winter fuel payment away from pensioners. The social care plans aren’t included. And there is nothing in it about scrapping free school meals for infants. Theresa May also seems to have dropped plans to extend grammar schools, he says. And he says there seems to be good news for “our furry friends”. Will May confirm that she does not plan to ban fox hunting? Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says by tradition he starts the debate by paying tribute MPs who have died. But he must also commemorate those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire. At least 79 people have died. Something went terribly wrong, he says. This must not be allowed to happen again. He says the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester were terrible. Hate has no creed, and violence no religion. Last night, at Finsbury Park, people from all communities met to show their opposition to violence. Jo Cox was murdered a year ago by someone driven by hate. Jo was driven by love, he says. And he pays tribute to Sir Gerald Kaufman who died earlier this year too. The Tory/DUP talks process looks set to run and run. According to Ulster TV’s Ken Reid, we may have to wait until next week for a resolution. Kwarteng (a leave supporter) says the repeal bill will be a great landmark in the constitutional history of our country. He says the last few months have been horrific. He never expected to see barriers on Westminster bridge. The appalling scenes in West London will never be forgotten, he says. It is in a sombre mood that he commends the gracious speech, he says. And that’s it. Kwasi Kwarteng, a Conservative backbencher, is speaking now. He says his great-great-grandfather never received a letter from Disraeli. It is nice to come back and see everyone in their place, he says. When the election result was declared, there were gasps of despair and deep disappointment. And that was just the parliamentary Labour party. A government was formed. And we could follow it all in the strictly impartial pages of the Evening Standard. He says his parents were immigrants from Ghana. His mother never expected to see him become an MP. (I’m not so sure about that. He was a scholar at Eton.) Benyon says too often MPs, and the people who report on them, are obsessed with the politics of Brexit. He says his constituents are more interested in the reality of Brexit. He says he voted remain. But we have to make the best of it, he says. He says he wants to be part of a parliament that made it work. He says at time the problems they face seem massive. But MPs have a means of keeping themselves grounded. They can visit an inspring school or charity, or speak to someone like a veteran, as he did. It is the “quiet but determined doers” he meets regularly who make him optimistic, he says. He says 27 years ago John Major spoke about creating “a nation at ease with itself”. He says the resonated with him a lot. And that’s it. He has finished. Benyon jokes that Greenham Common in his constituency has made it a regular tourist destination for the leader of the opposition. And he refer to his constituency, Newbury, being wealthy. Someone once joked that deprivation in West Berkshire is when Waitrose runs out of balsamic vinegar, he says. But is not all like that, he says. He praises Theresa May for saying she wanted to make Britain fairer in her first speech as prime minister. Richard Benyon, the Conservative former environment minister, is now moving the humble address to the Queen (a thank you note to her for turning up this morning). He starts by speaking about the “terrible tragedies” that have hit the UK recently. He says he is not the first Benyon to be asked to move the loyal address. His great, great grandfather was an MP. But he never spoke in the Commons. He was asked to move the loyal address in 1879, but turned down the invitation from Disraeli. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, moves a motion giving the speaker the power to appoint three temporary deputy speakers until full-time ones are elected. John Bercow, the speaker, starts, as is customary, by reading out a spiel about what is effectively the MPs’ code of conduct. It is a bit like the emergency evacuation instructions at the start of a flight. For example, Bercow has just said MPs should wear their passes when they are in the parliamentary estate. Very few of them every do ... This is from Labour’s Ian Austin. The Queen’s speech debate is about to start. The Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has been touring the broadcast studios following the Queen’s Speech. The former Tory leadership contender was asked on the BBC’s World at One whether she might stand again. She replied: “That’s an entirely hypothetical question”, adding fuel to speculation that the prominent Brexiteer is manoeuvring for the top job. Leadsom added that she did not have a “crystal ball” over the question of whether Theresa May would still be in place in 2019, but that it was her “sincere hope” that she would be. Leadsom also claimed that the Tories will balance books “by the end of the parliament” - despite them not being committed to it until the middle of the next decade. Interviewed later by Adam Boulton on Sky News, Leadsom contrasted the Conservatives economic policies with those of Labour and said: “My absolute hope and determination would be to keep this government going.” Here is my colleague Polly Toynbee on the Queen’s speech. The debate on the Queen’s speech will start at 2.30pm. For MPs it is very much “the first day of term” and the debate tends to combine a broad argument between government and opposition about policy with quite a lot of good humour, and tributes to MPs who have died. By tradition the debate is opened by two government backbenchers, a veteran and a rising star. Today they are (respectively) Richard Benyon and Kwasi Kwarteng. After the 2010 and the 2015 general election the highlights of the state opening debate were the speeches from Harriet Harman. As acting leader of the Labour party she was standing in for first Gordon Brown and then Ed Miliband, and she basically gave the same speech, advising new MPs to speak out and to make a fuss. It was a version of a speech she gave to new MPs at an induction session in 2010. She writes about it in her autobiography, A Woman’s Work, and it is worth posting at length. Remembering the lack of encouragement I was given [when I was a new MP], I urged them to be bold, telling them to ignore whips and senior members, who would inevitably tell them to keep their heads down, that they had to learn the ropes for at least 10 years. I said that they, having been elected, were not apprentice MPs or trainee MPs but the real thing. As the one and only MP for their constituency, they counted every bit as much as an MP who might have been there for decades; they had to blaze a trail so their constituents could see them fighting on their behalf. I told them there was no right or wrong way to be an MP. They would do it differently from the way in which we’d done it in the past and each of them had to do it in the way they felt was best. They should not get too worried about the complex rules of speaking in the chamber; the important thing was to get their own voice heard, in their own way ... I urged the new MPs to be high profile - there was no point in being an anonymous MP: everyone would be keen to see what they were doing and everything they did would matter. I told them that the previous week in my constituency I’d met a young woman coming out of the supermarket with a child in a buggy. She stopped me to tell me that I’d helped her mother when she was a child. One action, taken three decades ago, was still valued and had been passed on to a third generation. I warned the new MPs that they were not ‘only a backbencher’: as an MP, they held a public office and everything they did would be scrutinised. I said it was a noble thing to be an MP, something to be proud of, and they should remember to enjoy it. No doubt because of the excitement of being newly elected, they cheered wildly. A Woman’s Work is a wonderful memoir, honest and inspiring. I’d recommend it highly. To coincide with the Queen’s speech, the Movement for Justice By Any Means Necessary is holding a “day of rage” protest. My colleague Nadia Khomami is with them. Here is the Press Association on how this year’s Queen’s speech was a dress-down affair. The stripped-down Queen’s speech still offered a ceremony bursting with pomp and parliamentary pageantry as Theresa May sought to lay out her programme forgovernment. As temperatures soared outside, peers donned their traditional red robes, trimmed with ermine, while bishops and wig-wearing judges jostled together in the House of Lords chamber for the speech, watched by representatives from nations including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, France and Germany. Eschewing her traditional ceremonial robes for a royal blue hat and coat, the Queen was preceded to her golden throne by peers carrying the Cap of Maintenance and the Great Sword of State, symbols of the sovereign’s power and authority. May’s husband Philip was in the gallery to watch as the crown, which was chauffeured to the Palace of Westminster in its own car, was brought into the Lords chamber and placed on a cushion on top of a table to the right of the Queen. In an unusual turn of events, the Prince of Wales accompanied the Queen to the state opening as her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, is being treated in hospital for an infection. Here is my colleague Jonathan Freedland on what he thinks the Queen’s speech should have said. Four of the major teaching unions have put out a rare joint statement reacting to the Queen’s speech, accusing the government of “not listening to voters” over school funding in England. The statement reads in part: The problems in schools and sixth form colleges are real and immediate. £2.8bn has been cut from school budgets in the last two years. Schools are struggling to afford materials, sending out begging letters to parents and even considering closing earlier in the day to save money. Today was a golden opportunity for the new government to show they’ve understood the scale of the problem in education funding by announcing immediate plans to provide the additional funding needed. The lack of urgent action is deeply disappointing. The suggestion that government guidance to schools on financial health and efficiencies is the answer when schools are so starved of funds, will be greeted with dismay by all the school staff and school governors who are working so hard to protect pupils from the damaging cuts. But the statement - signed by the general secretaries of the Association of School and College Leaders, National Association of Head Teachers, National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers - also welcomed the culling of attempts to open more grammar schools, saying the government failed to produce “a shred of evidence” to support the move. DUP sources are casting doubt on claims they are demanding £1bn for the NHS and a further £1bn for infrastructure (see 12.02pm) as part of their deal with the Tories. The same sources have some interesting things to say about the Queen’s speech. They told the Guardian that it was “worth noting” that much of what is in an otherwise thin speech sits with the DUP’s last election manifesto. In national terms they say the 2% spend on defence and the military covenant were “key planks in our manifesto”. DUP sources also point out that there was no mention of winter fuel payments being means tested and no removal of the triple lock on pensions. These proposals were in the Tory manifesto, but the DUP has pledged to oppose them. Here is my colleague Adam Vaughan, the Guardian’s energy correspondent, on the omission of the energy price cap from the Queen’s speech. (See 11.42am.) Whether or not the Queen deliberately chose to give her speech in a hat bedecked with EU colours, there is no doubt about the sharp reduction in her government’s swagger over Brexit. Even its key enabling legislation is no longer called the “great” repeal bill, having seen the bragging prefix quietly dropped in favour of a more circumspect-sounding “repeal bill”. Legal purists may have always intended to strip away the political spin once it headed closer to the statute book, but the symbolism is as stark as the yellow stars on her majesty’s blue hat. In the white paper published in March, it was referred to 36 times as “great”, but not once in the 80 pages of notes published alongside the Queen’s speech. More significant signs of growing hesitancy were apparent in the government’s explanation of what the bill was intended to do. While insisting it would “allow for a smooth and orderly transition as the UK leaves the the EU”, there was an important new caveat. “The bill does not put any constraints on the withdrawal agreement we will make with the EU and further legislation will be introduced to support such an agreement if and when required,” insisted the government in its executive summary. In the context of a furious battle within the Conservative party over the type of Brexit that should be pursued, the “no constraints” line is recognition that, as David Davis is now fond of saying, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. For those, such as chancellor Philip Hammond, who would prefer to see a lengthy transition phase before Britain leaves the single market, this clause is a reminder that it could take more than a few days for the ink to dry on the goatskin parchment of the Queen’s speech. The electronic version of the document appears to have been an even more last-minute affair. Eagle-eyed readers spotted that the document containing the government background note appears to have been created at 11.30pm the night before the speech and was still being amended two hours before release. Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on the Queen’s speech. This slimmed down Queen’s speech shows a government on the edge. Having dropped everything from the dementia tax to fox hunting I assume the only reason they have proposed a space bill is so they can shoot their manifesto into space and pretend it never existed. People up and down the country are seeing our schools and hospitals in crisis. Proposed Tory cuts will leave our children in overcrowded classes in underfunded and crumbling schools, the sick left on trolleys in hospital corridors and the vulnerable without the vital services they rely on. This speech is bereft of any real solutions to these issues. Some reports are noting that Jeremy Corbyn did not bow to the Queen as he entered the Lords ahead of the Queen’s speech, styling this as a snub from the long-time republican. Theresa May did give a brief bow. However, a source close to the Labour leader argues that it is May who got the protocol wrong, and that traditionally, only the officials at the head of the procession do so. Footage of the May 2016 state opening of parliament shows that neither David Cameron or Corbyn bowed, so Labour might seem to be correct on this. The Evening Standard splash is highlighting the fact that the Queen’s speech did not commit the government to getting annual net migration below 100,000. George Osborne, the Standard’s editor and the former Tory chancellor, is strongly opposed to the target and wants the government to ditch it. But the Standard seems to be reading too much into the fact that the target did not get a mention. The prime minister’s spokesman has insisted the government is sitting to the Conservatives’ manifesto target of cutting immigration to the tens of thousand. Asked at a briefing with journalists why it was not specifically mentioned in the Queen’s Speech, he said: It’s not disappeared; we are absolutely committed to that. The prime minister has said it may take some time to achieve it, but that commitment remains, and there is in the Queen’s Speech an immigration bill which will allow us to have control over the numbers who enter from the European Union, and that’s obviously an important piece of work towards hitting the target. Here is my colleague Dan Roberts, the Guardian’s Brexit editor, on the Queen’s speech. Dan is referring to this line in the official notes on the Queen’s speech. The [repeal] bill does not put any constraints on the withdrawal agreement we will make with the EU and further legislation will be introduced to support such an agreement if and when required. The government briefing document accompanying the Queen’s speech lists 21 full bills proposed by the government and three draft ones, as well as saying that three finance bills are in the pipeline. So we are talking about 27 bills in total. Here is a full list of the bills. Brexit legislation (9 bills) These are the bills that will implement Brexit. A repeal bill - This will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and transpose current EU laws into UK law, to ensure legal continuity when the UK leaves the EU. A customs bill - This will replace EU customs rules and allow the UK to impose its own tariffs after Brexit. A trade bill - This will allow the UK to operate its own trade policy after Brexit. This may face opposition from those MPs determined to keep the UK in the EU customs union. An immigration bill - This will allow the UK to set its own immigration policy. A fisheries bill - This will enable the UK to take control of its fishing waters after Brexit and to set fishing quotas. An agriculture bill - This will set up a system to support farmers after Brexit takes them out of the common agriculture policy. A nuclear safeguards bill - This will set up a nuclear safeguards regime to compensate for the fact that Brexit will take the UK out of Euratom, a separate treaty governing safety in the civil nuclear power industry. An international sanctions bill - This will allow the UK to continue applying international sanctions, because after Brexit it will no longer be bound by EU sanctions policy. An EU (approvals) bill - This is a technical bill, implementing changes to treaties involving the EU, the UK and non-EU countries. Consumer legislation (5 bills or draft bills) These are bills intended to help consumers. They tend not to be party political, and ministers hope they will be popular. A draft tenant’s fees bill - This will ban landlords from charging tenants “letting fees”. A civil liability bill - This will tighten the rules on whiplash claims, and the government says this could save motorists £35 a year through cheaper car insurance as a result. A data protection bill - This will update data protecting laws, including giving people the right to force social media companies to delete information held about them at the age of 18. A travel protection bill - This will update travel protection law involving ATOL (the air travel organisers’ licence) so that it applies properly to the online travel market. A goods mortgage bill - This will modernise the law on goods mortgage lending. Vanilla legislation (7 bills or draft bills) These are also bills that are relatively non-political. They are the sort of measures that could just as well turn up in a Labour Queen’s speech. A draft domestic violence and abuse bill - This will establish a domestic violence and abuse commissioner and set out a legal definition of domestic abuse. A financial guidance and claims bill - This will tighten the regulation of claims management companies, and create a new organisation offering financial advice, replacing the three existing publicly-funded bodies providing financial advice. A space industry bill - This is intended to make the UK an attractive place to launch commercial satellites. An automated and electric vehicles bill - This will set up a network of charging points for electric cars and make insurance compulsory for self-driving cars. A courts bill - This will modernise courts, and stop domestic violence victims being cross-examined directly by their alleged abusers in family courts. An armed forces bill - This will allow flexible working in the armed forces. A draft patient safety bill - This will set up an independent health service safety investigation body. Continuity legislation (6 bills) These are bills the government has to pass just to carry on with normal government, or with decisions already taken A high speed rail (West Midlands to Crewe) bill - This will allow HS2 to be build from the West Midland to Crewe. A smart meter bill - This will enable the government to continue the roll-out of smart metering. A national insurance contributions bill - This will legislate for changes to national insurance contributions announced in 2016. Three finance bills - These will implement budget decisions. Here is footage of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn talking as they headed to the Lords to hear the Queen’s speech. This is about the only time in the parliamentary calendar when you see the prime minister and the leader of the opposition having to make small talk. They know they are on camera. When Gordon Brown was prime minister, he tended to put on a minor show of dominance by talking at David Cameron at some length, as if to show who was in charge. I seem to remember Cameron trying the same trick with Ed Miliband. May and Corbyn started off in awkward silence, as if they were ignoring each other. At this point May seems to be asking Corbyn if he arranged for his wife to watch the Queen’s speech from the gallery. Corbyn says he should have arranged tickets and didn’t, and grimaces in mock embarrassment. My colleague Anushka Asthana is discussing the Queen’s speech now on a Guardian Facebook live stream. Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, has just told the BBC that nothing should be read into the fact that the Queen did not mention President Trump’s proposed state visit. (See 11.46am.) He said the invitation had been made and accepted. It was not mentioned because a date for it has not been fixed, he said. Here is the 82-page government briefing note on the speech (pdf), containing the text of the speech and all the background notes to the proposed bills prepared by government departments. The proposed Tory deal with the DUP won’t come cheap, according to the latest briefing from Northern Ireland. This is from the BBC’s Norman Smith. The Queen has now left parliament. As Dennis Skinner pointed out earlier, she is now off to Royal Ascot, an engagement she will probably enjoy much more. She is said to like horses much more than parliamentarians. (It is not that she doesn’t like parliamentarians, at least as far as we know. But she is really, really passionate about horses.) That was the 64th time the Queen has delivered the Queen’s speech, according to the BBC’s Huw Edwards. She concludes: Members of the House of Commons Estimates for the public services will be laid before you. My lords and members of the Commons Other measures will be laid before you. I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels. Analysis: The bit about “estimates” (spending) is only addressed to MPs because peers do not vote on budgets. The final line is the customary reminder that, despite this being a list of things the government plans to do, life changes, the unexpected happens, and governments always end up introducing new bills they had not planned at the time of the Queen’s speech. She goes on: My ministers will ensure that the United Kingdom’s leading role on the world stage is maintained and enhanced as it leaves the European Union. As a permanent member of the United Nations security council, committed to spending 0.7% of national income on international development, my government will continue to drive international efforts that increase global security and project British values around the world. My government will work to find sustainable political solutions to conflicts across the Middle East. It will work to tackle the threat of terrorism at source by continuing the United Kingdom’s leading role in international military action to destroy Daesh in Iraq and Syria. It will also lead efforts to reform the international system to improve the United Kingdom’s ability to tackle mass migration, alleviate poverty, and end modern slavery. My government will continue to support international action against climate change, including the implementation of the Paris agreement. Prince Philip and I look forward to welcoming their Majesties King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain on a state visit in July. My government will host the Commonwealth summit in April next year to cement its relevance to this, and future generations. Analysis: The Queen does not mention President Trump making a state visit. That is the closest we have come to official confirmation of Patrick Wintour’s Guardian story – which has not been denied – about Trump telling Theresa May that he does not want to come “until the British public supports him coming”. Which means he could be waiting some time … She goes on: My government will bring forward proposals to ensure that critical national infrastructure is protected to safeguard national security. A commission for countering extremism will be established to support the government in stamping out extremist ideology in all its forms, both across society and on the internet, so it is denied a safe space to spread. In the light of the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, my government’s counter-terrorism strategy will be reviewed to ensure that the police and security services have all the powers they need, and that the length of custodial sentences for terrorism-related offences are sufficient to keep the population safe. She goes on: A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom retains its world-class regime protecting personal data, and proposals for a new digital charter will be brought forward to ensure that the United Kingdom is the safest place to be online. Legislation will also be introduced to modernise the courts system and to help reduce motor insurance premiums. My government will initiate a full public inquiry into the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower to ascertain the causes, and ensure that the appropriate lessons are learnt. To support victims, my government will take forward measures to introduce an independent public advocate, who will act for bereaved families after a public disaster and support them at public inquests. My ministers will continue to invest in our gallant Armed Forces, meeting the Nato commitment to spend at least 2% of national income on defence, and delivering on the armed forces covenant across the United Kingdom. Analysis: The Queen is referring to a data protection bill, which will implement the Conservative manifesto proposal to allow people to force social media companies to delete information held about them at the age of 18. There will also be a courts bill, which will stop domestic violence victims being directly cross-examined by their perpetrators in the family courts, and a civil liability bill, to make the system for personal injury compensation payments fairer. And there will be an armed forces (flexible working) bill to allow flexible working arrangements in the armed forces. She goes on: My ministers will work to improve social care and bring forward proposals for consultation. My government will ensure fairer markets for consumers, this will include bringing forward measures to help tackle unfair practices in the energy market to help reduce energy bills. A priority will be to build a more united country, strengthening the social, economic and cultural bonds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. My government will work in cooperation with the devolved administrations, and it will work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to support the return of devolved government. Analysis: The Queen says the government will bring in measures to cut energy bills. This is a reference to one of the high-profile Tory manifesto promises, for a cap on energy bills. But, interestingly, the government is not promising a bill on this, or even a draft bill. It has been reported that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, wants May to ditch this plan, and all that is being promised is a green paper on the subject (not even a white paper, a more definitive consultation document) and the government is saying it might help people on poor-value tariffs by getting the regulator to act instead of by legislation. The plan for a price cap may will be ditched. She goes on: My government will make further progress to tackle the gender pay gap and discrimination against people on the basis of their race, faith, gender, disability or sexual orientation. Legislation will be brought forward to protect the victims of domestic violence and abuse. My Government will reform mental health legislation and ensure that mental health is prioritised in the National Health Service in England. Proposals will be brought forward to ban unfair tenant fees, promote fairness and transparency in the housing market, and help ensure more homes are built. Analysis: The Queen is referring to the draft domestic violence and abuse bill and the draft tenants’s fees bill which were publicised by the government in the note they released overnight. (See 9.15am.) She goes on: My government will continue to work to ensure that every child has the opportunity to attend a good school and that all schools are fairly funded. My ministers will work to ensure people have the skills they need for the high-skilled, high-wage jobs of the future, including through a major reform of technical education. The national living wage will be increased so that people who are on the lowest pay benefit from the same improvements in earnings as higher paid workers. My ministers will seek to enhance rights and protections in the modern workplace. She goes on: My government will continue to improve the public finances, while keeping taxes low. It will spread prosperity and opportunity across the country through a new modern, industrial strategy. My government will work to attract investment in infrastructure to support economic growth. Legislation will be introduced to ensure the United Kingdom remains a world leader in new industries, including electric cars and commercial satellites. A new bill will also be brought forward to deliver the next phase of high-speed rail. Analysis: We knew we were leaving Europe. But are we really heading for space in the hope of forging a new trade deal? The Queen is referring to a space industry bill. Sadly, it’s not a Liam Fox initiative, but something mainly to do with making the UK an attractive place to launch commercial satellites. But it will also licence spaceflight, including rockets, which may cover Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic – a new service for those not deterred by their experience of the east coast mainline. The Queen is also referring to an automated and electric vehicles bill, which will set up a network of charging points for electric cars and make insurance compulsory for self-driving cars. There will also be an HS2 bill allowing HS2 to be build from the West Midlands to Crewe. She goes on: My ministers will strengthen the economy so that is supports the creation of jobs and generates the tax revenues needed to invest in the National Health Service, schools, and other public services. She goes on: A bill will be introduced to repeal the European Communities Act and provide certainty for individuals and businesses. This will be complemented by legislation to ensure that the United Kingdom makes a success of Brexit, establishing new national policies on immigration, international sanctions, nuclear safeguards, agriculture, and fisheries. My government will seek to maintain a deep and special partnership with European allies and to forge new trading relationships across the globe. New bills on trade and customs will help to implement an independent trade policy, and support will be given to help British businesses export to markets around the world. Analysis: The Queen starts with the issue that will dominate parliamentary business over the next two years and here she refers to eight separate pieces of legislation that will implement the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. They are: A repeal bill - This will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and transpose current EU laws into UK law, to ensure legal continuity when the UK leaves the EU. Ministers used to refer to it as the “great repeal bill”, but now it has just become the “repeal bill”. (Parliamentary clerks don’t let ministers include propagandist language in the official titles of bills.) A customs bill - This will replace EU customs rules and allow the UK to impose its own tariffs after Brexit. A trade bill - This will allow the UK to operate its own trade policy after Brexit. This may face opposition from those MPs determined to keep the UK in the EU customs union. An immigration bill - This will allow the UK to set its own immigration policy. The government is saying that free movement will go but, beyond saying that the new system will be “fair and sustainable”, it does not seem to be giving any new details today of what will be in the legislation. This is likely to be of the most contentious bills of the session. A fisheries bill - This will enable the UK to take control of its fishing waters after Brexit and to set fishing quotas. But the government does not seem to be saying anything new today on the tricky issue of what compromises it might strike to allow EU boats to fish in UK waters. An agriculture bill - This will set up a system to support farmers after Brexit takes them out of the common agriculture policy. But the government seems to be saying almost nothing today about how it will operate, or how generous it will be. A nuclear safeguards bill - This will set up a nuclear safeguards regime to compensate for the fact that Brexit will take the UK out of Euratom, a separate treaty governing safety in the civil nuclear power industry. An international sanctions bill - This will allow the UK to continue applying international sanctions, because after Brexit it will no longer be bound by EU sanctions policy. The Queen is now giving her speech. My government’s priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union. My ministers are committed to working with parliament, the devolved administrations, business and others to build the widest possible consensus on the country’s future outside the European Union. MPs head for the Commons chamber, led by Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Normally the PM and leader of the opposition exchange small talk, but May and Corbyn are mostly ignoring each other. Black Rod is in the Commons now summoning MPs to attend the Queen in the Lords. Like Black Rod, another ancient fixture of our constitution is the Labour MP Dennis Skinner, a republican, who by tradition always makes a joke at this point. This time it’s rather a good one – a reference to the fact the Queen is heading for Royal Ascot later. Get your skates on. First race is at half past two. This is the royal gallery in the Lords. The Queen is in the building. Prince Charles is with her. The Queen is leaving Buckingham Palace now for the state opening. The crown has already arrived. (See 11.19am.) Here is Theresa May leaving No 10 earlier for the Queen’s speech. The Democratic Unionist party’s ruling executive is scheduled to meet in Belfast on Thursday evening, adding to expectations that a deal might be completed tomorrow with the Conservatives. Some DUP sources are indicating that they are “95% there” regarding an arrangement with the Tories that would shore up a minority Conservative government. The DUP executive would be expected to rubber stamp any deal the party negotiators seal with Theresa May and her team. They also dismissed reports in the local press today that it was Northern Ireland Office officials who were holding up the deal being discussed with Downing Street. The sources said there had been some problems with the Treasury in regard to concessions the DUP is seeking for the Northern Ireland economy, including the abolition or radical cutting of air passenger duty tax. The DUP is still due to allow its 10 MPs to back the Queen’s speech when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons next week. Yesterday the DUP said it “would not be taken for granted” in the discussions and complained that the negotiations were not proceeding as they had expected –political code for frustration in the party that Downing Street officials were mishandling the talks in London. Here is more on the Duke of Edinburgh. This is from the Press Association. The Duke of Edinburgh has been admitted to hospital as a ‘precautionary measure’ for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition, Buckingham Palace said. Philip was supposed to be accompanying the Queen to the state opening of parliament on Wednesday but his place has been taken by the Prince of Wales. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to King Edward VII hospital in London last night, as a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. “Prince Philip is in good spirits and is disappointed to be missing the state opening of parliament and Royal Ascot. “The Prince of Wales will accompany the Queen to the state opening. “Her Majesty is being kept informed and will attend Royal Ascot as planned this afternoon.” The Press Association has just snapped this. The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to hospital last night as a ‘precautionary measure’ for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition, Buckingham Palace said. John Godfrey, head of policy at No 10, is leaving, BuzzFeed is reporting. The Guardian has had the news confirmed. This is from the BuzzFeed story. Following the disastrous June election result for the Conservatives, Theresa May’s joint chief of staff – and longtime key advisers – Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy resigned, while the Financial Times revealed last week that Godfrey’s deputy at the policy unit Will Tanner was departing. When Theresa May announced her snap election, No 10 director of communications Kate Perrior and prime minister’s spokesperson Lizzie Loudon also announced their departures. The flurry of departures mean virtually none of the top team brought into No 10 by Theresa May just 11 months ago now remain. The Queen’s speech will include plans for “a publicly funded advocate to act on behalf of families involved in a Hillsborough-style tragedy”, PoliticsHome is reporting. Damian Green, the first secretary of state (in effect, the deputy PM) told the Today programme this morning that there was still “every possibility” of the Conservatives striking a deal with the DUP, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former communications chief, has just started tweeting. Theresa May once made him the subject of a surprisingly brutal public joke, and he does not seem minded to be complimentary about her PR efforts. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the Today programme this morning that the minority Conservative government has “no right to govern” and that it should stand aside to let Labour run the country. He said: [The Conservatives] haven’t got an overall majority. So, yes, they have got the right to bring forward their own programme, but I don’t believe, actually, that they are legitimate in the sense that they have got a mandate that they asked for. We are now in a situation where I don’t think they have got the right to govern. However, they are now bringing forward their programme. We’ll seek to amend it. I think there is such disarray now, in the interest of the country, they should stand down and give Labour the opportunity of forming a minority government. They have actually junked the manifesto on which they fought the election, so they have now got no manifesto. Overnight Number 10 listed four bills that will be in the Queen’s speech. Here they are. A civil liability bill - This will tighten the rules on whiplash claims, and the government says this could save motorists £35 a year through cheaper car insurance as a result. It says: [The bill} will will address the rampant compensation culture and reduce the number and cost of whiplash claims by banning offers to settle claims without the support of medical evidence and introducing a new fixed tariff of compensation for whiplash injuries with a duration of up to 2 years. A financial guidance and claims bill - This will tighten the regulation of claims management companies, and create a new organisation offering financial advice, replacing the three existing publicly-funded bodies providing financial advice. The government says: The bill will strengthen the regulation of claims management companies by transferring the regulatory responsibility to the Financial Conduct Authority, and ensuring the FCA has the necessary powers to implement a robust regulatory regime, including a duty to cap fees. This will help tackle widespread malpractice across the claims management companies sector, such as nuisance calls and encouragement of fraudulent claims. A draft domestic violence and abuse bill - This will establish a domestic violence and abuse commissioner and set out a legal definition of domestic abuse. The government says: It will also ... create a consolidated new domestic abuse civil prevention and protection order regime; and ensure that if abusive behaviour involves a child, then the court can hand down a sentence that reflects the devastating life-long impact that abuse can have on the child. A draft tenant’s fees bill - This will ban landlords from charging tenants “letting fees”. It’s the state opening of parliament, but a slimmed-down, ceremony-lite, pomp-free version. The Queen will be arriving at the House of Lords in a car, not a carriage, and she won’t even be wearing the imperial state crown. Apparently that’s because the snap election meant there was a clash with other royal pageants, like Trooping the Colour, and so the Household Cavalry or whoever would not have had time to practice for it. But it is hard not to read this as a verdict on the quality of our governance. After all, if Theresa May couldn’t secure a majority, why should the Queen see fit to bother with a crown. According to the briefing released overnight, May acknowledges her failure to win the election outright. The Number 10 press notice quotes her saying: The election result was not the one I hoped for, but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent. We will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the British people, making their priorities our priorities. But that was a “prime minister said” quote from the press release, not a “prime minister will say” quote - ie, a quote on paper, not something actually she has actually said. Whether or not she will use the word “humility” remains to be said. The Queen’s speech list the bills the government hopes to pass over the next session of parliament, lasting (unusually) two years. It will be dominated by Brexit measures. Otherwise interest will focus on what is in (May’s non-Brexit priorities, and proposals that are non-contentious) and what’ out (anything for which there is not a Commons majority, which includes most of the headline measures in the Tory manifesto). Here is our overnight preview story. Here is the timetable for the day. 11.25am: MPs assemble in the Commons before processing to the Lords to hear the Queen’s speech. 2.30pm: MPs begin the Queen’s speech debate, with the main opening speeches coming from Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another after the Davis/Barnier press conference. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Last week, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it would not contend a court ruling ordering it to pay almost $500,000 in compensation to the family of a woman who killed herself two months after being forced to flee her home near the plant. That claim, which could pave the way for similar suits, has been followed by a unprecedented attempt by four Fukushima Daiichi workers to sue the utility for unpaid wages. The two former and two current workers, aged in their 30s to 60s, claim that Tepco and its contractors failed to ensure they were paid mandatory hazard allowances, on top of their regular wages. In the first legal challenge of its kind against Tepco, the four men, who are not named and wore masks in court for fear of reprisals from their employers, are seeking $600,000 in unpaid wages from Tepco and several of its partner firms. The men's lawyer said he believed more could follow among the 6,000 workers – most of whom work for contractors – involved in the dangerous 40-year operation to decommission the plant. \"A year ago, the prime minister told the world that Fukushima was under control. But that's not the case,\" Tsuguo Hirota told Reuters. \"Workers are not getting promised hazard pay and skilled workers are leaving. It's becoming a place for amateurs only, and that has to worry anyone who lives near the plant.\" The hazardous nature of work to control the flow of radioactive water, and to prepare damaged reactors for the removal of melted nuclear fuel prompted Tepco to announce late last year that it would double daily danger money payments to $200 per worker. But labourers employed by some of the 800 firms involved in decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi say the extra cash is being withheld by contractors and subcontractors, which claim they need the extra cash to keep their businesses afloat. \"My health could suffer one day … I believe there are many people who can't speak out about this kind of problem,\" one of the workers told public broadcaster NHK. \"I may get fired or may be given no more work. But I hope people will take this as an opportunity to speak up and get paid.\" The suits have opened a new front in the legal battle against Tepco, which is expected to pay more than $48bn in compensation to residents affected by the March 2011 disaster, and billions more on decontamination and decommissioning. Last month, a citizens' judicial panel ruled that three former Tepco executives should face criminal charges over the disaster. Prosecutors must respond to the panel by next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"women-in-leadership/2015/sep/03/a-new-kind-of-academia-free-courses-no-exams-and-real-life-lessons","type":"article","sectionId":"women-in-leadership","sectionName":"Women in Leadership","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-03T06:22:01Z","webTitle":"A new kind of academia: free courses, no exams and real life lessons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/sep/03/a-new-kind-of-academia-free-courses-no-exams-and-real-life-lessons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/women-in-leadership/2015/sep/03/a-new-kind-of-academia-free-courses-no-exams-and-real-life-lessons","fields":{"headline":"A new kind of academia: free courses, no exams and real life lessons","bodyText":"One of the defining features of Town Square Academia, in the remote Upper Galilee Region, is that it has no exams. All courses are free and there are no podiums for experts to lecture from. The most important thing is that every lesson taught here must be relevant to life outside the campus walls. Founded by Dr Ayelet Shavit and Yael Silver, the initiative, a series of community courses spanning everything from history of art to eco-feminism, aims to test whether highbrow academia could have a real impact on people’s lives. Shavit and Silver met with some criticism when they shared the project with university PR departments. “People kept telling us, you’re targeting people who don’t have the time or the leisure to spend on learning,” Shavit says. But she didn’t let that put her off, and the pair visited settlements and organisations across the region, asking people what they wanted to learn about. They didn’t expect the answer to be “quantum physics”. Nevertheless, Revolutions in Modern Physics proved a popular course. “People came from all over Upper Galilee,” Shavit says. Something became clear as the class got talking: the group wanted to understand nuclear power, a subject heavy on the minds of the Israeli population in the wake of the Iran nuclear deal. More specifically, they wanted to be able to pick apart news stories, to “see how information is used and abused.” “Afterwards people said, ‘I’m not this helpless person who has to eat up what other people tell me.’” The project, now in its third year, was born after a social justice movement hit Israel in the summer of 2011, with people protesting against the cost of living and the deterioration of public services. In Kiryat Shmona, where most of Town Square Academia’s courses are based, students and residents started thinking about those with power, and those without it, in their city. “There’s very little industry here, Tel Hai college is the biggest employer by far,” Shavit says. Professors took to the streets to give lectures, with students and residents joining in the debate. “It showed there’s a thirst for knowledge here,” with nowhere for debate to properly flourish. So Shavit and Silver set out to provide the community with an outlet for discussion. Funded by Tel Hai College, MIGAL and Coast to Coast/Galilee Panhandle Partnership of the Federations of Canada – UIA, Town Square Academia puts on ten courses a year, taking place in cafes, community centres and factories. Three quarters of attendees are women, which Shavit puts down to the fact that they offer simultaneous courses for kids, so the women, many of whom are mothers, don’t feel guilty for attending. Plus, it “takes the children away from the TV.” Courses often have two experts, one academic, one non-academic, both volunteers. At a course on leadership, local expert Leah Erlich described how she spoke up for a young woman who was abused and silenced by a man with connections to the local police force. The class then used Marxist theory to consider whether leadership comes from the individual or is more influenced by wider society. It’s a formula that many of the lessons stick to: start with people’s stories, then refer to relevant academic concepts, without veering too far from lived experiences. Conscious of the way that dense, theoretical texts can flag up social issues while, at the same time, eclipsing the voices of those most affected, Shavit wants to get the balance right between experience and theory. “I look at academia differently now,” she says. “I see how I’m part of an institution that brings knowledge and silences knowledge. Sometimes simultaneously.” This is why it’s so important that the project brings about change in the community, Yael says. A course about the chemistry of water prompted locals to monitor the quality of the water next to their homes using rigorous, scientific methods. Another class came up with an educational model designed to improve the lives of children with ADHD. Sometimes it’s about inspiring people, or simply developing their curiosity, Ayelet says. The physics course, for example, ranged from learning about how GPS works to contemplating Schrodinger’s cat. “It solidifies us as one community,” Town Square Academia student Orna Weinberg says. Orna never finished high school, but she doesn’t let that get in her way when it comes to approaching highbrow, theoretical topics. Silver says that The Upper Galilee, Israel’s northernmost region, is a “controversial and divided area”. The courses physically bring together diverse groups of people: religious and atheist, rich and poor. People from different settlements. People who’ve lived a mile away from the university their whole lives but have never set foot in it. “One of the problems for me as an academic is that we talk with people who are similar to us,” Shavit says. “We don’t check our theories in an environment that’s different from where we were raised.” On a larger scale, it’s hard not to extrapolate the metaphor to Israel’s defences. “We are so busy putting up borders,” she says, gesturing around her. “It’s not that borders are wrong, but sticking to them permanently and thinking there’s no other way of looking at differences: that’s the problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/live/2015/oct/20/china-and-the-uks-industry-ask-aditya-chakrabortty-anything","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T13:00:07Z","webTitle":"China and UK industry: ask Aditya Chakrabortty anything - live chat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2015/oct/20/china-and-the-uks-industry-ask-aditya-chakrabortty-anything","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/live/2015/oct/20/china-and-the-uks-industry-ask-aditya-chakrabortty-anything","fields":{"headline":"China and UK industry: ask Aditya Chakrabortty anything - live chat","bodyText":"Alexander DeHavilland asks: Are the British public, and the Tata Steel workers here in Motherwell right to feel they have been sold out by the UK government today? lastcosmonaut asks: Why do you think areas such as the UK skills-base, or ownership of key services, industries &amp; companies fall outside the Tory definition of ‘sovereignty? Noel_Doyle asks: What are your thoughts on Fully automated luxury communism? I.e using the increasing automation of work and a basic income to free people from work, instead of under capitalism condemning people to unemployment and poverty. Lluxate77 asks: Why do you that the political argument has not been made against selling off our national assets to foreign governments? To my mind it seems like an open goal. ClassicRando asks: The strike price for electricity from these new reactors is very high, do the contracts include minimum quantities of electricity to be purchased? If another cheaper, cleaner source of electricity was found after this was built, undercutting nuclear electricity, would we still be contractually obliged to purchase from the nuclear operator? What do the UK funding guarantees cover - just the construction of the nuclear plant or also the on-going profitablility in the production of electricity by the operator? BienH asks: If there is any risk that no new nuclear power station is on stream well before 2023, is there a penalty clause? Is it not better to boost the subsidy for a quick build-up of the renewables capacity rathr than cutting it, in addition to more HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) connections to th continent. In our view that would be a better way of ensuring that ‘the lights stay on’? The delays at Flamanville and Olkiluoto don’t exacly inspire any confidence! smublidonggg asks: Why is Osborne very willing to purchase in bulk steel from China for this ‘’infrastructure’’ projects e.g. HS2 needs 0.8 million tonnes, and yet he won’t purchase UK steel? If he gave the contracts to UK based steel firms, he would support this industry and this would have a multiplier effect on the communities around those industries, the workers, supporting businesses and the UK economy. ClassicRando asks: You state above that the UK hasnt benfitted from competition in the Energy sector and yet our domestic electricity prices are below the EU average, including coutries with higher state influence and ownership of utilities - Do you have any evidence things wouldve been cheaper if we had kept these nationalised?

RedTuyll asks: I read your article with interest and am grateful that you highlight this continual undermining of British infrastructure. What is not clear to me is beyond EDF or the Chinese government who is actually gaining from these deals? Protest is more effective if we have a target - we can hardly blame EDF or China for taking advantage of outrageously beneficial terms so the question is who in the UK benefits from giving them these terms? robedinburgh asks: Do we have an idea of how much cheaper it would be for the government to build and directly operate Hinkley point c given low borrowing rates? “The British nuclear industry is now really just a decommissioning industry” SadEye asks about the long-term implications of the China nuclear deal.

Aditya has arrived at Guardian Towers, and will be answering questions imminently. Get your questions to him by posting in the comments section below. Good afternoon! Aditya will be online at 1pm (BST). As a senior economics commentator, Aditya Chakrabortty has written about some of the pressing questions of our age, from the democratic implications of ongoing austerity, to the housing crisis and the widening gap between rich and poor. His latest column addresses the implications of George Osborne’s nuclear and infrastructure deals with China and France: At some point during this week’s visit of president Xi Jinping – perhaps sandwiched between lunch at the palace and a trip to Chequers – Osborne shall confirm that nuclear plants will be built at Hinkley in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk, by the energy giant EDF, nearly 85% owned by the French government, and China. What’s more, Beijing will get a shot at designing and building its own nuclear facility at Bradwell in Essex. Britain has made ‘visionary’ choice to become China’s best friend, says Xi Read more Even as that announcement is made with all the fanfare available to the British state, the promises of privatisation will be revealed as lies. What were voters guaranteed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major, as they flogged off electricity and the rest of our publicly-owned utilities? More competition, lower bills and greater investment: all the plump fruit of a more dynamic capitalism. A generation later and their children, David Cameron and Osborne, are handing Britain’s nuclear future back to the public sector – of two foreign countries – and paying handsomely for the privilege.

It looks so palpably dumb that you wonder if there is not some profound and subtle intelligence that has escaped the attention of the commentators, experts and interested parties lining up to condemn it. So it is with the housing and planning bill, recently announced with a fusillade of cliches from the housing and planning minister, Brandon Lewis. It will allow a “one-nation government”, said Lewis, to “kick-start a national crusade” that will “get one million homes built by 2020” and “help deliver the homes hard-working people rightly deserve, transforming generation rent into generation buy”. In fact, it is more likely to increase the divide between the nation of people who own their home and the nation who have no prospect of doing so, while enriching landowners and others not in the greatest need. Its most eye-catching proposal is for “starter homes”, to be sold to first-time buyers at 80% of market price. Local authorities will be under a legal duty to “guarantee their provision” on “reasonably sized new development sites”. This seems to address a real issue, which is the struggle of young people on low-to-middle incomes to get on the housing ladder, but, as Shelter has pointed out, people on average incomes will not be able to afford them in over half of the country. Starter homes can only come at the expense of other forms of affordable housing currently provided through planning gain, whereby developers have to provide a proportion in return for getting permission to build. These include shared ownership, a proved way of achieving what starter homes are supposed to do. The bill proposes that buyers of starter homes can sell them at full market value after five years, giving a windfall to the lucky recipients but removing forever their benefit to first-time buyers of the future. They also give housebuilders the headache of selling identical products at dramatically different prices. Starter homes come on top of the idea, first announced in an attempt to spice up the Tory election campaign, of selling housing association homes to their tenants at reduced prices. Housing associations have since got some concessions out of the government in return for dropping their opposition to this plan – individual associations can opt out and those that do sell will be recompensed for the full value of the property sold – but this will create a shortfall that has to be paid from somewhere. The current idea is that the money will come from forcing councils to sell their properties in high-value areas, when they become vacant, and handing over the proceeds to central government to, in effect, pass on to housing associations, but it has been pointed out the numbers simply don’t add up. As high-value areas are also those of the greatest pressure for affordable housing, the effect of this circuitous subsidy to housing association buyers will be to remove resources from places where it is needed most. It will increase the division of rich zones from poor. At the same time that the government wants to stimulate demand with new subsidies to buyers, it is trying to ease supply by relaxing the planning system. A temporary provision that facilitates the conversion of offices into housing will be made permanent, which will continue the effect that has already started, of hollowing out cities of places of work and of the cafes, dry-cleaners and other businesses that serve them. It is essentially a gift to people who already own such properties, who will see their values rise by millions. This provision will compound another weakness of the bill, which is its flimsiness when it comes to positive planning and the design of new houses. It seems likely that, in the rush for units that the government hopes to prompt, such matters as balancing homes with schools and places of work and leisure will suffer. The danger is of getting dwellings lined up as if on supermarket shelves and there is not much comfort in the bill that this will not happen. There is much else in what is a sprawling piece of proposed legislation. There are sensible-sounding ideas for controlling rogue landlords and encouraging small and medium size construction companies. There are plans for releasing more public land and for making planning and compulsory purchase more efficient. There is a striking willingness to refer decisions back to the secretary of state, which looks much like the coup de grace for any lingering pretensions this government has to localism. But the gist of it is this – the government wants a lot more homes to be built. In order to do this it will provide short-term benefits to some groups at the expense of others. The winners will be more visible than the losers – there will be plenty of opportunities to photograph ministers handing the keys of new homes to smiling buyers but few images of those people, as “hard working” as anyone else, pushed further away from a secure home. There is nothing in the bill about managing inflation in house prices, which could defeat its purposes: if prices go up by 15% or 20% in a year it soon wipes out the starter homes’ discount for new buyers. The bill may not be as effective as it hopes in encouraging building. It subscribes to the belief that, if demand is stimulated and the planning system is relaxed to encourage supply, the market will step up and deliver. In this, it reworks ideas that have been tried for at least 30 years, in which time the market has consistently not delivered. For sound commercial reasons, housebuilders will never flood their own market with huge numbers of new homes. So in fact the bill does look stupid in many respects. Where, apart from the electoral cunning of securing the votes of the subsidised buyers, is the smart part? It could be something like this: by accruing powers to the secretary of state and bending housing associations to the government’s will, it paves the way for future state intervention at a large scale. The hard-hatted, hi-vis chancellor of the exchequer has shown his willingness to invest in high-speed rail and nuclear power. It wouldn’t be a huge leap for George the Builder to turn his powers to housing. It remains to be seen whether he would do this in a way that benefits the country as a whole."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2015/may/14/us-obama-arab-gulf-saudi-arabia-iran-yemen-military","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T20:45:41Z","webTitle":"US agrees to allay Arab Gulf's Iran worries with military assistance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/14/us-obama-arab-gulf-saudi-arabia-iran-yemen-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/may/14/us-obama-arab-gulf-saudi-arabia-iran-yemen-military","fields":{"headline":"US agrees to allay Arab Gulf's Iran worries with military assistance","bodyText":"The US has agreed to a package of military assistance for countries in the Arab Gulf, as escalating tensions with Iran serve as an ominous backdrop to their joint summit at the Camp David presidential retreat outside Washington. During talks designed to reassure Gulf allies about the deal to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Barack Obama was asked instead about the threat posed by its conventional forces. According to White House officials present in the meeting, he agreed to help bolster the defensive capabilities of the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). “We’re really looking at what we can do to expedite the provision of support and capacity-building to the GCC in areas like ballistic missile defence, maritime security, special operations, counter-terrorism capacity, border security,” deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters. The talks began shortly after reports earlier on Thursday that Iranian Revolutionary guards had fired warning shots at a Singapore-flagged commercial ship in the Gulf, before vessels from the United Arab Emirates came to its aid. Tensions at sea have grown since the start of Saudi-led military strikes against rebels in Yemen, who many Arab and western leaders believe are directly supported by Iran. In turn, Iran accused Saudi Arabian King Salman on Thursday of leading an “axis of aggression and criminality against the Islamic [nation] and the Arab world”. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, leader of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy committee, showed a news conference in Damascus a picture of a Yemeni child allegedly killed by air strikes and, in remarks directed at the Saudi king, said: “I am talking to you, Salman. What is the guilt of this child to be burned by your fire?” Mounting tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have forced the US to reassure the Gulf monarchies that it has not abandoned them in its quest to strike a deal with the Islamic Republic, a source of growing mistrust believed to have led King Salman to stay away from the Camp David summit. “It’s a transaction on the nuclear issue,” said Rhodes at Camp David, when asked if the US was seeking a transformational deal with the government in Tehran. “This is not a broader rapprochement between the United States and Iran on a range of issues. It is a very specific agreement that will deal with the Iranian nuclear program.” But the White House played down reports in the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and other GCC participants were considering matching Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme, claiming the issue had not come up. “There will be no need to see the type of regional arms race that would make an already volatile part of the world that much more unstable and insecure,” said Rhodes. He added: “We don’t want to see any type of arms race in the region. If there is an interest in nuclear power, which some of these countries have had, there are established means of accessing that power.” Talks were due to continue on Thursday afternoon, about the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. The leaders were then scheduled to issue a joint communique detailing their military cooperation agreements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/may/15/john-kerry-beijing-trip-escalating-south-china-sea-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T16:47:26Z","webTitle":"John Kerry heads to Beijing amid escalating South China Sea dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/john-kerry-beijing-trip-escalating-south-china-sea-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/may/15/john-kerry-beijing-trip-escalating-south-china-sea-dispute","fields":{"headline":"John Kerry heads to Beijing amid escalating South China Sea dispute","bodyText":"The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is flying into Beijing for a weekend of difficult talks with Chinese officials, likely to be dominated by escalating tensions about the South China Sea. Washington has been very publicly contemplating a stronger response to a large-scale Chinese land reclamation project in disputed waters, which is turning submerged reefs into airstrips, and creating thousands of hectares of dry land. Several regional powers including the Philippines and Vietnam have overlapping claims to the area, mostly uninhabited reefs and atolls that lie in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes. Their competing demands have festered for years, occasionally blowing up, but China’s artificial islands could potentially change the balance of power in the area. Kerry’s trip was scheduled long before the problem blew up into an urgent diplomatic dispute, but it has now become a focus of the visit. He promised the meetings will leave China “in absolutely no doubt” about Washington’s commitment to ensuring freedom of navigation and aviation in the South China Sea. One of the options on the table is making air and naval patrols closer to newly created islands. China has responded by warning the US not to take “risky or provocative” actions, and accusing the Philippines – which has backed greater American involvement – of magnifying the dispute. “China will firmly uphold its sovereignty and rights and interests,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing on Friday. The US risks making the area a “powder keg”, hardline nationalist tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial, adding that officials in Beijing should not forget that China is a nuclear power ready to defend its interests. “If such an aggressive plan is approved, it will create huge waves in the South China Sea and a confrontation between both sides can hardly be avoided,” the newspaper said. “The US can expect potent countermeasures.” The artificial island construction is a legitimate project with peaceful motives, “such as offering humanitarian shelter for passing ships in the typhoon season”, the paper said. Tensions mounted further after a senior US defence official said the country plans to put long-range bomber planes in Australia, that could be used as deterrents against China. The Australian government, which hopes to sign a long-awaited free-trade deal with Beijing later this year, moved fast to dismiss that report, saying the US assistant secretary for Asian and Pacific security affairs had “misspoken”. Many experts and military officials in America expect Beijing to declare an Air Defence Identification Zone (Adiz) in the area, Reuters reported, after building up some of the airstrips and radar stations they would need to support it. Adizes are not governed by formal treaties or laws but are used by some countries to extend control beyond national borders, requiring civilian and military aircraft to identify themselves or face possible military interception. “It’s not inevitable but if we are betting paychecks I’ll bet that they will eventually declare one, I just don’t know when,” a senior US commander familiar with the situation in Asia told the news agency.

A high-level German politician put it this way to me recently: “It’s like a whole hysteria going on here. The Berlin political world is emotional all the time. It has to stop, but I don’t know how. The anger is on the left, it’s on the right.” The historian Jacob Soll touched on this outpouring of emotion as it relates to Greece in a column in the New York Times last week, and his conclusion is that Germans must regain their cool if they want to lead Europe. He is right, but he is skipping a step. Germans cannot regain their cool until they reduce the outrage they feel towards Greece, which they perceive as the guilty partner in their eurozone marriage. To do this, both nations must engage an impartial, outside mediator to help them mitigate the outrage they feel towards each other. In a structured, therapy-like setting, relevant policymakers from both sides would then finally be able to sit together and create a shared vision to wrest Greece from its economic depression. Outrage-mitigation mediation works in situations where activists and corporations find themselves at loggerheads. Ideally, corporations and their critics commit to sitting together in a room and sharing their dilemmas – to actually explaining their positions in the safe space created by the mediators. The chief executive of a corporation that has flouted environmental laws might say something like: “You activists just don’t get it. This pollution is not that bad. It creates X amount of jobs and it allows us to earn Y amount of profit. We can then pay Z taxes and thereby fulfil our role in society.” The activists might reply: “We won’t accept that logic, because – aside from the fact that you’re ruining the environment, perhaps with the tacit acceptance of regulators whom you’ve bought off – your pollution is just shifting the cost of your business to society, which has to deal with all of these sick and/or dead people. But, OK, we get that your business has an economic purpose, so if you stop polluting and move to another model, we will mobilise our base and our leadership to support you.” Germany can look to its own transformation away from nuclear power to renewables as an example here. This process, accelerated after Fukushima, saw anti-nuclear activists, politicians and the power industry jointly define the vision for the future state of Germany’s energy supply. Since everyone has bought into the vision, activists and industry stand eagerly behind the transformation. In fact, buy-in for this green movement has become so widespread that it has become part of Germany’s national identity. Seen in this light, last week’s deal imposing a 77% VAT increase – from 13% to 23% – and other punitive measures on Greece are bound to fail: not only because they would seem to contradict a century of economic theory, but also because neither Germany nor Greece has bought into them. Everyone hates this deal. Germany feels it is being asked for a gift at the end of a gun, sinking money into a country that will never actually pay it back and that it does not perceive as critical for its national and economic security. Greece is outraged that more austerity will further lower its standard of living, and it is tired of being called lazy and inept by Europe’s de facto hegemonic power. The finance ministers Wolfgang Schäuble and Euclid Tsakalotos must lead their staffs in committing to outrage mitigation under mediation. This is imperative because functionaries from both governments are, sadly, pushing their negative emotion out into their nations’ media. And Greek and German media are in turn whipping up the kind of populist sentiment that is manifesting itself as anti-Greece protests in front of the Bundestag or Angela Merkel Hitler posters in Athens. The toxicity of the debate has reached fever pitch on both sides. An impartial mediating team – comprising “middle power” diplomats supported by a consultancy specialising in outrage mitigation – could help treat the emotion and lower the outrage. Once this is done, policymakers in Athens and Berlin will be in a position to draft a shared vision for what a successful future state looks like and how it can be achieved. Until this happens, we will see the perpetuation of a crisis in which Germans become angrier, Greeks poorer and other Europeans doubtful of the resilience of the European Union project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2015/mar/04/james-franco-richard-gere-tribeca-film-festival-lineup","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-04T09:23:37Z","webTitle":"James Franco and Richard Gere headline Tribeca film festival lineup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/04/james-franco-richard-gere-tribeca-film-festival-lineup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/04/james-franco-richard-gere-tribeca-film-festival-lineup","fields":{"headline":"James Franco and Richard Gere headline Tribeca film festival lineup","bodyText":"Tribeca, the film festival founded by Robert De Niro, has secured some eye-catching world premieres for its 2015 edition, beginning 15 April. Chief among them is The Adderall Diaries, the latest film to star the hugely prolific James Franco. It’s adapted from the book of the same name by Stephen Elliott, a blend of inward-turning memoir about his writer’s block and addiction to attention-deficit medication, and an outward-looking investigation of a murder case in San Francisco – in the city’s underground S&amp;M scene, Elliott had crossed paths with a man who confessed to a string of related killings. In the film, Franco plays Elliott alongside a classy supporting cast including Ed Harris, Amber Heard and Cynthia Nixon. Another starry project is Franny, with Richard Gere playing against type as a freewheeling, eccentric philanthropist – complete with natty scarf and glasses – who worms his way into the life of a newly married couple (Dakota Fanning and Theo James) in an attempt to revive his youth. There’s also Meadowland, a drama about a couple played by Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson who try to cope after their son goes missing – supporting players include Juno Temple, Giovanni Ribisi, and Mad Men’s Elizabeth Moss. Elsewhere there’s the feature debut of Northern Irish film-maker Stephen Fingleton, a post-apocalyptic drama about a farmer with strained resources trying to weather the arrival of two women; and Bridgend from Danish director Jeppe Rønde, based in the Welsh town with an alarmingly high suicide rate. The festival’s documentary strand meanwhile features films exploring sake production, Havana drag racers, nuclear power and New Yorker cartoonists, among others. Its opening night film is Live From New York!, a documentary about American TV comedy institution Saturday Night Live. There’s also a place for The Wolfpack, Crystal Moselle’s documentary about an isolated family cut off from everyday New York, which made a major splash at this year’s Sundance film festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/13/profile-angela-merkel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-13T00:02:32Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel: enigmatic leader of a divided land | profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/profile-angela-merkel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/13/profile-angela-merkel","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel: enigmatic leader of a divided land","bodyText":"It is often said that Angela Merkel is the most powerful woman in the world. She is probably also the most powerful figure in the history of the European Union. She has been German chancellor for a decade. And yet, despite having so much power for so long, she remains a mystery. We have little idea what Merkel really thinks. It is not only that she is herself remarkably uncommunicative for a modern politician but also that most of what is said about her is either spin or speculation. She has a handful of ultra-loyal confidants, who can be guaranteed, when they speak about her, to tell the story she wants people to hear. Meanwhile, those who are outside this inner circle don’t really know what she is thinking or what motivates her, though many often claim to. As a result, Merkel is more opaque than perhaps any other head of government in the west. According to Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of the Munich-based Süddeutsche Zeitung, who wrote an authorised biography of her, published in 2013, Merkel’s anachronistic reticence has its origins in her childhood in East Germany. It was there, as she herself once put it an in interview, she “learned to keep quiet”. Merkel’s father, Horst Kasner, was a Protestant pastor who, shortly after her birth in 1954, moved with his family from Hamburg to Templin, a small town 50 miles north of Berlin, where he took over a seminary. Although the family discussed politics at home, Merkel learned from an early age to be careful about what she said to other people in the world beyond the family’s “protected idyll”, as Kornelius calls it. “The mystery that is Merkel has its roots in that doomed republic,” he writes. If Kornelius is right, it suggests, somewhat disturbingly, that Merkel has imported into the democratic culture of the Federal Republic a political style that comes out of the authoritarian culture of the German Democratic Republic. It is as if she has recreated the “protected idyll” of her childhood within the chancellery in Berlin. This remote figure was perhaps the perfect leader for the somewhat post-democratic Germany that has existed for the last decade. Since becoming chancellor in 2005, Merkel has been the embodiment of an extraordinary consensus in German politics. For two of the last three electoral periods since then, she has led a grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. Between them, the two parties currently have 503 out of 630 seats in the Bundestag, an extraordinary majority that means that they can, and do, ignore the opposition left and Greens. (Last year, Merkel was even reprimanded for talking too loudly in the Bundestag while a Green MP was speaking). The grand coalition was held together by an ideological convergence as the Social Democrats moved to the right on economic policy (most notably in supporting her in imposing austerity on the rest of the eurozone) and the Christian Democrats moved to the left on social and environmental policy (most notably in phasing out nuclear power – the so-called Energiewende). Last year, a leading Social Democrat, Torsten Albrig, even questioned whether his party needed its own candidate for chancellor in the next election (scheduled for 2017) because Merkel was doing such an “excellent” job. However, the refugee crisis has shattered what might be called the “Merkel consensus” and Germany has suddenly become a deeply divided country. Just as the consensus of the last decade centred on her, so now does the increasingly polarised debate about the refugee crisis. Since last autumn, she has been praised and criticised for opening Germany’s borders to refugees from around the world, seen by both her supporters and her critics as a sudden and surprising departure from her usual pragmatism. Merkel’s supporters explain and justify this transformation in two ways – both of which should be treated with scepticism. One has to do with her upbringing in East Germany. “I lived behind a fence too long for me to now wish for those times to return,” she is supposed to have said to the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. The other is that we are seeing is a manifestation of the Christian compassion that she learned growing up in the seminary, which included a home for disabled people. In short, in the refugee crisis, she is the good Samaritan. In fact, however, what actually happened last autumn was more complicated and less deliberate than these explanations suggest. Rather than making a dramatic decision to “open Germany’s borders”, Merkel took a series of small steps in a complex situation and then failed to take action to change course. This had huge consequences for Germany and for the rest of Europe that she may not even have grasped – and now it is difficult to see a way out. In that sense, Merkel’s decision-making looks less like a departure from her previous style, as many believe, than a continuation of it. As usual, Merkel waited as long as she possibly could – after all, for several years as the conflict in Syria worsened, Germany did very little while Greece and Italy were overwhelmed by the influx of refugees – and reacted, rather than acted, only when it was absolutely necessary. This looks rather like her approach to the euro crisis, except that while in that case there was a consensus in Germany behind her, in the refugee crisis it is dividing Germany. Merkel placed a huge bet on the willingness of the German people to accept, and integrate, millions of asylum seekers. Last summer, after it became clear that the number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany in 2015 would be much higher than the authorities had originally thought, she told the German public: “Wir schaffen das!” (“We can do it!”) Her apparent determination to integrate millions of asylum seekers into German society won her new supporters on the left, which again makes it look like a typical Merkel move. This time, however, it has also alienated many on the right, including many within her own party. In an extraordinary interview with a newspaper last month, the Bavarian leader, Horst Seehofer, said that there was now a “Herrschaft des Unrechts” in Germany – in other words, that the rule of law no longer existed. The terminology he used evoked the concept of an Unrechtstaat, normally used to describe totalitarian or criminal states such as the German Democratic Republic or the Nazi state. In other words, he is challenging not just Merkel and government policy but the legitimacy of the state itself. Today’s elections in three German states have been hyped as a moment of truth for Merkel. The dubious deal she agreed with Turkey – and the decision by EU member states along the “Balkan route” to close their borders – may go some way to reassuring voters that the numbers of asylum seekers coming to Germany will now decrease. Nevertheless, the Christian Democrats are likely to take a big hit and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany, AfD) – created in 2013 as a direct response to Merkel’s declaration that “there is no alternative” to her approach to the euro crisis – is likely to win enough votes to sit in all three state parliaments. Whatever happens today, it is difficult to see how Merkel could be deposed as chancellor, not least because it is difficult to see who could succeed her apart from the 73 year-old finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble. Some claim that she will be forced to change course on the refugee crisis. But she has already made it clear that, as in the euro crisis, she believes there is “no alternative” to her approach. The danger, though, is that this will further increase the sense of powerlessness that her opponents feel and fuel the radicalisation that is taking place. A small but growing minority in Germany feels it has no way of influencing policy through the democratic process and has no alternative but to take matters into its own hands and “resist” state power. They are being empowered and emboldened by statements made by Seehofer and AfD leaders such as Björn Höcke, who speaks of an impending “civil war” in Germany. Last October, Henriette Reker, a 59-year-old woman who worked as the city of Cologne’s social affairs commissioner and was standing as a candidate for mayor, was stabbed and seriously injured by a man who was apparently enraged by the wave of immigrants. Last year, when Merkel herself visited the town of Heidenau in Saxony Anhalt (one of the three states that votes today) and was called a “traitor”, her spokesperson said there was a “lynch mob atmosphere”. Merkel is likely to remain chancellor and the grand coalition will remain in place until the election next year, and perhaps even beyond it, as if the Merkel consensus still existed. But beneath the surface, and in part as a reaction against Merkel’s perceived intransigence, Germany is becoming angrier and more violent. Hans Kundnani is a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund THE MERKEL FILE Born Angela Dorothea Kasner in 1954 in Hamburg, West Germany.

When Helmut Kohl, the first chancellor of a reunified Germany, became embroiled in a slush fund scandal, the party hesitated.

At all. On Easter Monday she attended the CND march at Aldermaston, wearing (\"under about 25 layers\", because of the cold) one of two T-shirts she designed for the occasion – Education not Trident, and NHS not Trident – and, atop a flatbed truck, gave a three-minute speech at five of the facility's gates. Today, sitting in an east London bar, she gets out a big hardback notebook containing emphatic scribbles about investment returns on education as opposed to Trident (she says up to 10.8% on £100bn, simply from the higher taxes paid by better-educated people, as opposed to \"some outdated warheads and some rusty, very expensive submarines\"); the needy vanity of having nuclear weapons (\"there's a huge amount of testosterone involved in the nuclear [power] … Fukushima's probably the ultimate orgasm, isn't it? It just goes on and on\"). Later she will list the far-reaching health and agricultural ramifications of the accident in Japan, describe the PR muscle at energy company EDF, list the ex-cabinet ministers and their relations who have taken jobs relating to the nuclear industry … It was the march, and the fact that it still had to happen in 2013, plus the fact that the government is not only committed to renewing Trident, but is intending to do so while making such savage cuts to the welfare state, that made her feel so depressed. She was disappointed by the lack of press at Aldermaston, but thrilled by the people she met, especially the veteran campaigner Pat Arrowsmith, on whom she evidently has a kind of girl crush. \"She was yelling at people trying to warm their hands by the fire. 'Come on, stand by the road! You've got to be visible!' She's 83! I can't say she was sweet. But she was awesome, in the original sense of the word.\" What kind of party will she establish? \"Well, I suppose it would be the common sense of the common man – a campaigning organisation with the object of taking us into direct democracy like they have in Switzerland [where] there's referendums on everything to do with public spending.\" She imagines it being run online, with the aim of persuading individuals to write to their MPs with the threat that if they do not do what the majority wants with public money – such as scrap Trident – they will not be voted for again. \"Techniques need to be updated. Because you know – marching, demos, T-shirts, direct action – are ignored by the media. Owen Patterson receiving 80,000 emails [asking him to stop blocking a ban on pesticides linked to the fall in bee numbers] – he called it a cyber-attack, rather than communication from concerned UK citizens.\" There are a few holes in her idea (I wonder if she would be as sanguine as she claims if the public voted to reinstate the death penalty, for instance) but there is no mistaking her sincerity. Hamnett made her first slogan T-shirt – Choose Life (now co-opted by anti-abortionists in the US, \"which is really infuriating\") – exactly 30 years ago, and then a year later was photographed wearing one to a reception at 10 Downing Street. It said \"58% don't want Pershing\" (actually, Britain had cruise missiles, as Thatcher apparently pointed out), and was \"a hideous piece of theatrical tat, knocked up that afternoon\". Were you nervous? \"Ya-ah! I kept it – because I knew, from past experience as a child in my dad's world\" — he fought in the second world war, served as defence attache in various embassies during the cold war, and as a military adviser to Harold Wilson during the Cuban missile crisis – \"that the best thing to do would be to keep that covered up until the last moment. I thought, 'smiling wins', so I stuck this smile on. Everybody was there in their couture, and I'm wearing this thing, like a sandwich board – it was bad. And then trying to be cool – there's this wonderful French saying, 'It's all in the bearing' – so even if you're caught naked, it's how you hold yourself. I remembered this, so I took a glass of champagne,\" she suspends a delicate hand in the air, as if carrying a china teacup – \"but the glass of champagne was going like this\" – a wild shaking motion – so I had to grab my wrist to carry on this composure.\" In the end she was the last to leave, \"because I wanted to knobble her [Thatcher] about acid rain\". For quite a while, in the 80s and early 90s, Hamnett could do no wrong. She claims she invented boiler suits, stone-washed denim, stretch denim, garment washing; \"power-dressing\" was the title of one of her shows before it entered the lexicon. At one point in the early 90s she had 700 stores worldwide and a turnover of £30-40m. Even when she put elastic bands around her wrist \"because they're dead useful\" it was taken as a fashion statement. \"I mean, get real!\" She threw incredible parties – one, on two boats on the Seine, where the entertainment was a young Lily Savage, \"people talked about this party for 15 years. It was fabulous fun.\" Do you miss all that? \"I miss that, hell yeah.\" Eventually, though, she found the attention \"very strange and alienating. I felt very much alone.\" After she left Central St Martin's she was married and divorced, then had two children in a second relationship, which also broke up. She is drily direct about the challenge of being so much more successful than her partners. \"They hate it.\" Any examples? \"I wouldn't tell them to you if I had. But it is difficult for strong women. I think because men – it's like biological programming – they don't like to be challenged. I mean I adore men, I'm not that kind of feminist. I think we're equal but different, but working with men, employing men – it's very, very hard.\" Her parents paid for boarding school – Cheltenham Ladies' College – but made a point of refusing to support her after that. \"I was deeply hurt, but OK, you take it on board. And I'm hugely grateful, because I think they did the right thing.\" She is proud to have always been financially independent, in fact, \"I over-achieved on it slightly. And that was absolutely great.\" Taking her cue, partly, from a father who had signed the Official Secrets Act and so couldn't talk about work, she banned even talking about her job, let alone working at it, after 5.30pm when her sons were small, and 7.30pm to this day; she did not work during holidays. The Official Secrets Act had darker ramifications for her family, however, \"because you can't confide,\" she says. Her parents separated and her father committed suicide when she was 28. Then, in 1989, she discovered how cotton was produced – the terrible cost, to humans and the environment, of blanket use of pesticides – and decided things had to change. Suddenly she was going to trade fairs to \"meet people I'd been buying 100,000 metres off, and saying, 'Have you got any organic cotton?', and they'd say, 'Why should we produce it since you're the only one asking for it?'\" And although she soldiered on for years, trying to set up sustainable and ethical supply chains, selling her house to finance an online eco-store, she found the process so dispiriting that she eventually withdrew her brand. She stills sell T-shirts, particularly through the Co-op chain in Italy. In 2006-7 she started a sustainable clothing line for Tesco, but that ended prematurely when a complaint she made about the marketing, to a reporter from Draper's Record became, as she puts it, \"Hamnett leaves Tesco in fair trade fiasco\". \"I feel angry with the industry. To start with, I thought if I told people what was happening their reaction would be the same as mine, which was, 'Oh my god. We've got to change immediately.' And that was quite an education. I realised I'd been an innocent – a tool of an industry where the true price was paid at the bottom of the supply chain. We were all just puppets allowed to have their little parties at the top, while they'd be trundling away underneath.\" And now there's the recession, which has hurt sales of organic food – but not organic cotton, it turns out, sales of which are rising, but which still only accounts for 1.5% of all cotton sold. \"I don't know if it's happening with ethical clothing because it's still a kind of slightly dark area – all the people going into it are well-intentioned, but it's not like the big fashion houses, who should be going into it.\" How about Stella McCartney? \"She does animal rights – she doesn't do enough organic cotton, to be perfectly honest.\" Livia Firth? \"Yeah – she's doing her red carpet – green carpet – it's OK, but it's a bit worthy, do you know what I mean? It's not the sexiest thing you'd want to do.\" In general, she thinks the lack of action shocking. Is anyone doing a decent job? \"H&amp;M are doing a good job at the moment I think. They're using a lot of organic cotton and they're getting it out there and that's great. M&amp;S are doing their cleaner cotton, but it's not sustainable – no matter what anybody says. M&amp;S really need to pull their finger out, because they've got so much power, you know. They should walk the walk.\" The high street is, in her view, \"amazing – better than designers, actually. Did you see the Yves Saint Laurent?\" then, later, \"I think clothes have got really strange. I don't want to slag anybody off.\" (Not that it has stopped her before: \"Cosmetic companies don't like black models,\" she once said, about the lack of black models on runways. \"The racist bitches. I have no idea why when it's obvious that black girls are just so genuinely much more beautiful than caucasians, who have clearly got the short straw.\") \"But I look at the collections and think that's a really frumpy length, at mid-calf – that would look vile on anybody. No, I think the high street does a brilliant job – it would be nice if they did it socially responsibly as well.\" Next year, when she turns 67, she plans to relaunch her designer line, starting with menswear, for autumn/winter 2014. It will be split between pieces made in England – \"we're desperate for jobs in this country\" (also a sales pitch) – and pieces made fully sustainably in the far east. And in the meantime, there's the political party, there's the campaigning. The evening we met, she was going on to a meeting of the Dalston Darlings – the east London branch of the WI. \"I've decided I'm going to join, because it's an incredible campaigning organisation. I've never been in my life. But you've got to use everything.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/18/david-cameron-dismisses-risk-of-rift-with-us-over-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-18T21:11:24Z","webTitle":"David Cameron dismisses risk of rift with US over China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/david-cameron-dismisses-risk-of-rift-with-us-over-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/18/david-cameron-dismisses-risk-of-rift-with-us-over-china","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron dismisses risk of rift with US over China","bodyText":"David Cameron has insisted that the UK’s new “golden era” with China will not harm the special relationship with the US, as he prepares to roll out the red carpet for a historic state visit by the country’s president, Xi Jinping this week. Xi’s first official visit to London, beginning on Tuesday, is expected to be marked by protests by activists against human rights abuses, and concerns that the UK is jeopardising national security by allowing Chinese state companies to invest in British nuclear power plants. His state visit to the US in September was marked by tensions over security, and a threat by Barack Obama to pursue sanctions against Chinese entities carrying out a series of cyberattacks. But in a clear contrast to the US wariness towards Beijing, Cameron has been repeatedly hailing the prospect of a golden era in Britain’s relationship with China. Along with George Osborne, the chancellor, he has deliberately focused on the opportunity for trade relations and largely omitted mention of either human rights or security concerns. In a rare interview, Xi praised Britain’s “visionary and strategic” decision to position itself as Beijing’s best friend in the west as he prepared to embark on the first state visit to the UK since 2005, taking with him billions of pounds of planned infrastructure investment. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has promised to raise human rights issues, probably at a state banquet held by the Queen. Corbyn has also been afforded a meeting with the Chinese leader at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening before the banquet. But speaking on the BBC on Sunday, Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, said the president was “not here for a debate about human rights” and suggested bringing up the issue at the dinner was not an appropriate way to behave. “I think the British people are very gentlemen, very smart. They know how to behave on occasions like this … You think the Labour party will raise human rights at a state banquet? I don’t think so.” The ambassador said it was natural that there were differences between China and the UK, suggesting Chinese people care more about jobs and housing. “We do not shy away from discussions about human rights,” he said, adding that he had a “good meeting” with Corbyn last week and that China was “not interested in microphone diplomacy”. Before the four-day visit, Cameron gave an interview to Chinese state TV in which he said the two countries could work together not just on trade but on “climate change and tackling poverty”. He will also use the occasion to stress that Britain’s leading role in the EU is beneficial to China as a trading partner in a move that is likely to inflame Conservative Eurosceptics. “China is investing more in Britain now than other European countries,” Cameron said. “And the change we will see is obviously the investment into our infrastructure, Chinese companies employing people and creating jobs. But I think it’s also a big win for China as well, having access to a country that is a leading member of the EU, and has so many other contacts and roles in the world.” Asked if the visit would harm the UK’s ties with the US, which has objected to Britain’s membership of China’s new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, the prime minister said: “We see no conflict with having that very special relationship, with wanting to be a strong partner for China as the Chinese economy continues to grow and China emerges as an enormous world power.” Xi will spend four nights in Britain, staying at Buckingham Palace, giving a speech at Westminster, visiting the City of London UK-China business summit, and flying to Manchester with Osborne to visit the National Graphene Institute as well as Manchester City Football Club. He is expected to use a speech at Guildhall on Wednesday to set out how he hopes to make London the global centre for offshore Chinese finance. Prince Charles, a supporter of the Dalai Lama, is due to miss the state banquet but has invited Xi to a separate meeting over tea at Clarence House. Osborne paved the way for the a shift in relations with China during a visit to the country last month, during which he heavily emphasised friendship and trade ties, after relations hit a low point in 2012 following Cameron’s meeting with the Dalai Lama. However, there are a number of groups with concerns about Cameron’s decision to embrace ties with the Chinese, including Labour MPs, human rights campaigners – and reportedly the intelligence agencies. There are said to be particular worries that a Chinese state-owned company could insert backdoor traps into nuclear technology, enabling it to shut down a power station in the event of a diplomatic row. Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, has echoed such concerns, telling the Guardian the public were worried about Cameron allowing investment that could be “not just about putting our energy security, but actually putting our national security potentially at risk as well”. Amnesty International has also promised demonstrations in London over China’s human rights record. The group said: “The [Chinese] government has ratcheted up censorship of the internet, clamped down on civil society, increased its ideological controls over the media and academia, and launched several large-scale crackdowns on human rights defenders, lawyers, and activists. “Most recently, at least 245 lawyers and activists have been targeted in an unprecedented nationwide campaign over the last 100 days, and at least 30 are missing or still in police custody.” Steve Hilton, Cameron’s former strategy chief in Downing Street, has also condemned the government’s “obsession” with China. Hilton wrote in the Observer: “Surely we should be fighting corruption in the world, not feeding it with fat contracts that filch the earnings of British taxpayers to fund the lavish lifestyles of sleazy Chinese elites.” Apart from human rights, the state visit may be overshadowed by a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth – something that is likely have a major impact on the global economy and especially on the UK, as the largest European investor in China and the largest destination in Europe for China’s outward investment. Labour MPs, including shadow minister Nic Dakin, have urged the government to bring up the impact of Chinese overproduction of steel on the global markets, which has led to shutdowns and job losses in the UK industry. “There is an opportunity this week, with the visit of the Chinese [president], for the UK government to make clear that it will not accept any more cheap Chinese steel imports,” he said on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/oct/18/britian-has-made-visionary-choice-to-become-chinas-best-friend-says-xi","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-18T04:54:38Z","webTitle":"Britain has made 'visionary' choice to become China's best friend, says Xi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/18/britian-has-made-visionary-choice-to-become-chinas-best-friend-says-xi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/oct/18/britian-has-made-visionary-choice-to-become-chinas-best-friend-says-xi","fields":{"headline":"Britain has made 'visionary' choice to become China's best friend, says Xi","bodyText":"Chinese president Xi Jinping praised Britain’s “visionary and strategic choice” to become Beijing’s best friend in the west as he prepared to jet off on his first state visit to the UK, taking with him billions of pounds of planned investment. The trip, Xi’s first to Britain in more than two decades, has been hailed by British and Chinese officials as the start of a “golden era” of relations which the Treasury hopes will make China Britain’s second biggest trade partner within 10 years. “The UK has stated that it will be the western country that is most open to China,” Xi told Reuters in a rare written interview published on the eve of his departure. “This is a visionary and strategic choice that fully meets Britain’s own long-term interest.” During the four-day trip, which officially begins on Tuesday, Xi will be feted by sports and film stars, Nobel-winning scientists, members of the royal family and politicians. David Cameron and George Osborne will both accompany Xi, who Beijing describes as a football fan, to Manchester where he will visit Manchester City football club and dine at Town Hall. The Communist party leader will also address parliament. Chinese state media has predicted Britain will afford an “ultra-royal welcome” to Xi, who last set foot in the UK in 1994 when he was an official in the south-eastern city of Fuzhou. A frontpage story in the China Daily boasted that Xi’s arrival would be celebrated with a 103-gun salute – 41 in Green Park and 62 at the Tower of London. Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism, said Beijing would revel in the pomp and circumstance. “They will be looking for horses and people in funny hats and meeting the Queen. That plays fantastically well back in China and they make big use of that to show how important the Chinese leadership is,” he said. “It also plays to the pitch that China is now being recognised on the world stage as a great power. This is especially true in Britain’s case because it was those nasty Brits who beat them in the opium war. Now the table has turned and it is China in the ascendancy and it is Britain who is pandering to the Chinese.” Michel Hockx, the director of the SOAS China Institute, said Xi was coming to Britain with clear economic objectives. “The Chinese economy is slowing down and it is changing its nature from an investment-driven growth economy to an economy that has to look to invest in other places,” he said. “Chinese businesses are very eager to invest in other countries and some of the best export products that China has to offer are to do with infrastructure, high-speed trains, energy things like that and these are exactly the things that the UK needs.” About 150 deals are expected to be sealed this week in areas such as healthcare, aircraft manufacturing and energy. Perhaps the most significant anticipated announcement surrounds moves to allow China to design and build a new nuclear power plant at Bradwell in Essex. Beijing hopes that project will serve as an international shop window that will help it hawk its nuclear technology around the globe. As well as securing billions of pounds of Chinese investment, Britain hopes to advance efforts to turn London into a key trading centre for China’s currency, the renminbi, and to boost trade with the world’s second largest economy. During a tour of China last month, chancellor George Osborne unveiled plans to make it Britain’s second biggest trade partner by 2025. The growing proximity between the Conservative and Communist parties has attracted fierce criticism from those who believe Britain has abandoned its commitment to human rights by cosying up to Beijing. British officials say that while there will be “robust” behind-the-scenes discussions there will be no room for “megaphone diplomacy” during Xi’s visit. China’s UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming last week warned that his president would be offended if he faced public criticism over human rights. Howie accused Downing Street of turning its back on Hong Kong’s struggle for democracy and ignoring an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that is underway back in China. “It is so obsequious, it is just nauseating,” said Howie. “Clearly, China under Xi Jinping has become highly repressive towards those who do not agree with the rules ... [but] we haven’t heard anything of substance from the UK government about what is happening. “[Beijing] must be loving how America’s best ally is fawning and falling over itself to curry favour with China.” Britain’s determination to build a “golden era” of relations with China – and its increasing public silence on issues such as human rights – marks a striking U-turn for David Cameron. During a 2010 trip to Beijing he called for “greater political opening” in China and talked of concerns over human rights. “We don’t raise these issues to make to us look good, or to flaunt publicly that we have done so. We raise them because the British people expect us to, and because we have sincere and deeply held concerns,” Cameron said. Hockx, from SOAS, said Britain appeared to be taking advantage of the growing rift between China and the United States, whose relationship has suffered because of issues including cyber-espionage and the South China Sea. “In a sense Cameron is doing to Xi Jinping what Tony Blair did to George Bush. [There were] massive ideological differences at the time between Europe and America but Britain was the one country that stuck with the US. And in a sense Cameron is doing the same with China now, saying, ‘We are going to stick with you in this partnership despite the fact that other European countries and other western countries have these problems with you.’ “It’s a risky policy but it is certainly one that in terms of trade relations could be very beneficial,” Hockx added. In an editorial, the state-run Global Times tabloid praised Downing Street’s policy change and dismissed criticism of the “golden era” as “sour grapes”. “The national interests of Britain are the foundation of this policy,” it argued. “David Cameron or [George] Osborne will not blink in front of the ‘human rights fighters.’” In his written interview with Reuters, Xi recognised there were “misgivings” about the relationship between Beijing and London. “What I want to stress is that in today’s world, no country can afford to pursue development with its door closed. One should open the door, warmly welcome friends and be hospitable to them,” he wrote. Kerry Brown, the director of King’s College London’s Lau China Institute, said Beijing would be unperturbed by the prime minister’s change of heart and glad to deal with an increasingly “compliant” Britain. “The Chinese have dealt with the British for a long time, since Macartney’s mission to China in 1793. So they are practiced at the brilliant complexity of British hypocrisy and I think they are very comfortable dealing with that. This works well for them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/small-business-blog/2014/dec/16/future-nuclear-small-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-16T09:44:39Z","webTitle":"The future of the nuclear industry relies on small businesses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/small-business-blog/2014/dec/16/future-nuclear-small-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/small-business-blog/2014/dec/16/future-nuclear-small-businesses","fields":{"headline":"The future of the nuclear industry relies on small businesses","bodyText":"Nuclear power has been a part of the UK’s energy supply for more than half a century. Today, the industry provides a fifth of the UK’s electricity and employs 44,000 highly-skilled people. But with the majority of the UK’s existing plants due to close by 2030, we are entering a new dawn. Our new nuclear era will start with the construction of a £16bn power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which will power more than 15m homes with electricity. Plans are also in place to build up to 16GW of new nuclear facilities by 2030. The investment will run to £60bn, and the UK supply chain has the potential to capture up to 60% of that spending. Globally, the opportunities are even greater, with around £930bn to be spent building new reactors and £50bn a year spent on decommissioning nuclear by 2020. In the past, heavy regulation and the conservative culture of the nuclear business has held back innovation. However, advances in technology mean that new ideas in nuclear power are thriving and the energy source is becoming more affordable than ever before. What many people might not realise is that, in future, the majority of nuclear innovation will come from small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). In this growing sector, SMEs will play an important role and the nuclear supply chain will give small businesses the chance to stake a significant stake in the domestic and global nuclear markets, creating high-value jobs and economic growth. The process has already started. Earlier this year, following a competitive bidding process, £13m was awarded to small companies and consortia working to develop new technologies for the nuclear sector. This investment is directly funding projects run by SMEs to design technologies to detect vibrations from rotating equipment to improve the safety of nuclear plants, measure the extent of radioactive contamination in concrete, which cuts the risk of demolishing old nuclear facilities, and even developing an early warning system to prevent the blockage of cooling systems by jellyfish blooms. These projects, and the consortia of small organisations behind them, will help our civil nuclear industry set new standards in safe and smart operation. They show how the nuclear industry can rely on smaller players that will take essential steps forward, which, in turn, helps larger power companies to provide a reliable source of energy and bring energy costs down. Small businesses will help the UK consolidate the areas in which we are already world-leaders, and make the first move towards opening up new areas of expertise. It’s time for the UK to design a new supply chain which takes advantage of commercial opportunities, but it requires small businesses t understand that the nuclear sector welcomes and relies upon them. Energy is no longer dominated by big players: it’s time for small businessess to take centre stage.

Though there are treaties banning biological and chemical weapons, cluster bombs, and landmines, there is no such ban on nuclear weapons, even though their use would breach international agreements, not least the Geneva Conventions. 70 years after Hiroshima, despite all the rhetoric and genuflection (and negotiations with Iran) moves towards global nuclear disarmament are further away than ever. Vladimir Putin brandishes Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons capability, presenting British ministers (and the Labour front bench) an excuse to spend £100bn-plus on a new fleet of four Trident nuclear ballistic submarines to provide a Continuous At Sea Deterrence (CASD). Yet David Cameron insists the greatest, indeed existential, threat to Britain, one the country will face for a generation, comes, not from any hostile state, but from violent Islamic extremists, notably Isis. Tony Blair said of Trident in his autobiography, A Journey: “The expense is huge and the utility … non-existent in terms of military use”. In the end he thought giving it up would be “too big a downgrading of our status as a nation”. (Of the Labour leadership candidates, only Jeremy Corbyn opposes Trident.) Sceptics describe nuclear weapons as “power tools”. Major General Patrick Cordingley, former commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats, says strategic nuclear weapons have no military use. “It would seem”, he said recently, “the government wishes to replace Trident simply to remain a nuclear power alongside the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council. This is misguided and flies in the face of public opinion; we have more to offer than nuclear bombs”. Britain continues to modernise its nuclear weapons arsenal. Though successive governments have reduced the stock, the UK still holds more than a hundred “operationally available warheads” . Without the cooperation of the US, concluded a report last year by the London-based Trident Commission, the life expectancy of the UK’s nuclear capability could be measured in months.The commission’s crossparty panel described Britain’s deterrent as “a hostage to American goodwill”. This year’s non-profileration treaty (NPT) review conference held under UN auspices in New York, took a step backwards on the road to nuclear disarmament, with the five “official” nuclear powers - the UK, US, Russia, China, and France - insisting on even vaguer language, and more caveats, than they have in the past. But the non-nuclear powers, the vast majority, are fighting back. 159 countries signed a statement at the end of the New York conference. “All efforts must be exerted to eliminate the threat of these weapons of mass destruction”, they said. “The only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons will never be used again is through their total elimination.” The statement referred to a “renewed resolve of the international community, together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other organisations, to address “the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.” And more than a hundred countries have signed what they call a “humanitarian pledge”. It states: “the risk of a nuclear weapon explosion is significantly greater than previously assumed and is indeed increasing with increased proliferation, the lowering of the technical threshold for nuclear weapon capability, the ongoing modernisation of nuclear weapon arsenals in nuclear weapon possessing states, and the role that is attributed to nuclear weapons in the nuclear doctrines of possessor states...” Beatrice Fihn, executive director of ican (the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons) told me: “The humanitarian initiative has enabled people to see nuclear weapons for what they really are, inhumane, indiscriminate and unacceptable weapons of terror.” One of the secret documents obtained by Edward Snowden in 2013 said US intelligence agencies had little “knowledge of the security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons and associated material”. A classified US state department document released by WikiLeaks quotes a Russian foreign ministry official warning that Islamists “are not only seeking power in Pakistan but are also trying to get their hands on nuclear materials”. Schlosser warns: “There are still about 16,000 nuclear weapons in the world. Terrorists only need to steal one”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/19/tackling-climate-change-should-be-the-uks-top-energy-priority","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-19T19:32:44Z","webTitle":"Tackling climate change should be the UK’s top energy priority | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/19/tackling-climate-change-should-be-the-uks-top-energy-priority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/19/tackling-climate-change-should-be-the-uks-top-energy-priority","fields":{"headline":"Tackling climate change should be the UK’s top energy priority","bodyText":"The energy secretary’s much-hyped speech (UK to retreat from climate change goals, says minister, 18 November) was a spectacular display of governmental cognitive dissonance – saying one thing while acting in an entirely contradictory manner. Amber Rudd offered warm words about “a new energy infrastructure, fit for the 21st century”, yet her department ploughs ahead with firing up outdated high-carbon gas power stations set to burn climate changing fossil fuels for decades to come. Shutting coal power stations is a good move – and campaigners should be applauded for their long-running focus on this important goal – but doing so while promising a wave of new gas power stations simply doesn’t go close to ensuring we meet the energy challenges we face. Rudd spoke of competitiveness being at the heart of our energy system, yet her government has committed to subsidising outrageously expensive nuclear power stations while slashing support for solar and wind, which are popular, cheaper and faster to deploy. In these crucial weeks ahead of the Paris climate talks the government is compounding the failure of its shortsighted energy strategy. Never has a greater chance for rethinking the way we power our communities been presented to us – yet Rudd and her colleagues look set to squander this unique opportunity by hiding behind hot air and spin while failing to take the urgent action needed to tackle climate change. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • If Amber Rudd is concerned to bring about a consumer-led energy system for the UK, perhaps her first act should be to abolish the coalition government’s 2013 statutory requirement for all domestic energy bills to include a standing charge. As well as feather-bedding the energy companies, standing charges are having a discriminatory impact on millions of low-use and/or energy-efficient domestic consumers, who in effect pay a higher overall unit price for their gas and electricity than do larger users, because any standing charge forms a greater proportion of their overall energy bill. For example, and with standing charges commonly £100 pa, anyone whose annual actual electricity costs are £1,000 pa (total bill £1,100) will be consuming 10 times the amount of power of someone whose electricity costs are £100 pa (total bill £200 pa), yet only be paying a total annual bill a little over five times higher. In short, standing charges require low-use consumers to subsidise the energy costs of larger users. Standing charges for gas and electricity should be abolished, and replaced with a single-rate tariff. Neil Hornsby Inverness • Closure of coal-fired stations has long been seen as an important part of transitioning us to low-carbon energy so Wednesday’s announcement should not come as a huge surprise to many in the industry. As fears about our tightening capacity margin and escalating energy costs grow, cost-effective and secure energy should rightly stay as a priority alongside tackling climate change. The challenge is to achieve a balance of all three of these energy policy goals – to do so it’s crucial that Britain establishes a long-term energy policy that accommodates a broad mix of capacity types including nuclear, gas, carbon capture and storage, renewables and new forms of capacity like storage, demand-side response and smart meters which can help consumers control and reduce their carbon footprint and energy bills at an individual and community level. An adaptable and modern energy infrastructure is critical to achieving this broad mix of capacity. The recently announced National Infrastructure Commission is well placed to help deliver this long-term energy policy and modern energy infrastructure. The government must now build on their announcement by ensuring that this commission remains focused on these goals in the coming months. Dr Simon Harrison Institution of Engineering and Technology • Amber Rudd justifies her “dash for gas” on the specious grounds that it will halve carbon emissions. Gas production and consumption produce two greenhouse gases: methane, the primary product; and CO2, the combustion product. Both contain carbon but methane is a vastly more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, and even limited leakage to the atmosphere can drive significant climate change. This makes the “right” energy policy contingent on the reality of methane emissions and here Decc has it completely wrong. Since 2007, methane levels over the US, the North Atlantic and Europe have risen sharply, bucking a previous slow downward trend. Satellite observations show that this increase is a result of gas escaping from production wells in the US, and peer-reviewed scientific publications show that the amount released is in the range of 3-15% of total production. This is well above the value that Decc currently assumes in its calculations on greenhouse gas emissions, and – alarmingly – above the threshold where energy production from gas causes more climate change than using coal. Amber Rudd must understand that no fossil fuel is acceptable for future electricity generation and that our security and future prosperity depend on a rapid transition to a zero-carbon economy. Professor Nick Cowern York • It is hardly surprising that the chief executive of Oil and Gas UK argues against fossil fuel disinvestment, but substituting one fossil fuel with another is not going to solve climate change (Letters, 18 November). This approach was tried by car manufacturers who promoted diesel instead of petrol as a means of reducing carbon emissions, but failed to admit that the technology needed to control other pollutants from diesel engines would inevitably compromise fuel efficiency. The same applies to the replacement of coal with shale gas. It seems attractive until you consider that fugitive emissions of methane tend to cancel out any benefit to the climate. In any event the industry has been advocating gas instead of coal for 30 years, so if this represents a bridge to the promised land of renewable energy, it is leading us in the wrong direction. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • Amber Rudd cuts “subsidises” to renewable energy but never acknowledges the £26bn given to the fossil fuel industry as highlighted in the IMF report. Climate change is the most important problem we face – we are not capable of controlling the huge natural currents that drive our weather around the world. Janet Roberts Chair, Pembrokeshire South East Energy Group (PSEEG) • Is it too late to give the name “Amber” to the next in the series of storms rolling in from the Atlantic? Colin Barr Ulverston, Cumbria • Bryony Worthington (Stopping fracking won’t stop climate change, 15 September) claims green campaigners need to look beyond the future threats of hydraulic fracturing and worry about the current threats that are causing climate change. She is saying fracking will not stop climate change and the protesters should focus on other ways to fight climate change that could be done today. Although fracking will not stop climate change, it is a big reason why it is happening. The release of methane into the atmosphere during the drilling process and the greenhouse gases when burning natural gas all contributes to climate change. This is one big cycle that continues to happen if nothing is done about fracking now. Protests are a way to draw attention to this issue now and prevent it from being a future threat. Ending climate change won’t happen immediately. Change needs to occur continuously and these protests are the first steps to ending climate change.

Hisao Tanaka, the company’s president and chief executive, will be replaced by Toshiba’s chairman, Masashi Muromachi, until a new chief executive is found. Tanaka’s predecessors, Norio Sasaki, who is vice-chairman, and Atsutoshi Nishida, who is an adviser to the company, will also leave. Toshiba overstated its operating profits over several years in accounting irregularities involving its top management, an independent panel of accountants and lawyers said on Monday. Tanaka and Sasaki knew about the profit overstatement and created a pressurised corporate culture that prompted business heads to manipulate figures to meet targets, the investigators said in their report. At a news conference on Tuesday, Tanaka said he did not tell anyone to falsify accounts but that he would take responsibility for the investigators’ findings at a company that is regarded as one of the emblems of Japan’s industrial prowess. “I see this as the most damaging event for our brand in the company’s 140-year history,” Tanaka said after making a ritual deep bow of contrition while cameras whirred and flashed. “I don’t think these problems can be overcome overnight.” Tanaka and Sasaki originally intended to resign in the coming months, but their ousting was announced soon after a government minister said the scandal could damage international confidence in Japanese business. The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, said: “If [Japan] fails to implement appropriate corporate governance, it could lose the market’s trust. It’s very regrettable.” Japan has been trying to demonstrate improved corporate governance after it was revealed in late 2011 that Olympus, another of the country’s biggest names, had hidden $1.7bn (£1.1bn) of losses over 13 years. The country still lags behind the UK and the US on the openness of its company reporting and the independence of boards of directors. In the UK, it would be highly unusual for two former chief executives to retain influence at a big company. Loizos Heracleous, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: “The Toshiba scandal will be seen in the context of the Olympus event, with investors wondering whether there is a pattern of account manipulation in corporate behaviour, and observing much more closely. Japanese regulatory authorities will need to reassure the markets that they are casting a watchful eye over Japanese corporations, and also that Japanese corporate culture is moving towards global expectations with respect to robustness of corporate governance.” In total, eight company officials resigned following the report, and Tanaka said Toshiba is now considering recruiting outside directors for more than half its board seats. Improper accounting at Toshiba included overstatements and booking profits early or pushing back the recording of losses or charges. Those actions often resulted in still higher targets being set for business divisions in the following period. “This led to a need to carry out improper accounting on an even bigger scale, and as this was repeated, the scale of the inappropriate bookkeeping also expanded,” the investigators’ report said. Toshiba, whose products range from laptops and televisions to nuclear power plants and railway systems, is one of the fixtures of the Japanese corporate scene. Despite its shares losing almost a quarter of their value since the irregularities surfaced in April, it is still Japan’s 10th biggest company by market value. It was created by a merger in 1938 but its roots date back to 1875 and it was one of the companies that turned Japan into an industrial power. Koichi Ueda, a lawyer who headed the investigating panel, said: “[For] a company that represents Japan to be doing something like this institutionally was shocking.” One of the investigators’ early theories was that top managers set unrealistic targets for new operations because they were worried about the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on Toshiba’s nuclear division. The report did not mention Fukushima but it said pressure within Toshiba was particularly strong in the accounting years 2011 and 2012. The report said much of the improper accounting, which stretched back to 2008, was intentional and would have been difficult for auditors to detect. Toshiba will have to restate its accounts and could face big fines. Shares in Toshiba rose 6% on Tuesday on relief the report did not contain worse findings. Standard &amp; Poor’s, the rating agency, said the required restatement of Toshiba’s profit could lead to its credit rating being downgraded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/18/nuclear-power-ministers-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-18T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: ministers offer reactor deal until 2050","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/18/nuclear-power-ministers-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/18/nuclear-power-ministers-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: ministers offer reactor deal until 2050","bodyText":"The government is launching a last-ditch attempt to sign up energy companies to build new nuclear power stations by proposing to sign contracts guaranteeing subsidies for up to 40 years. The coalition agreement reached between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in 2010 promised that nuclear power stations would be built only if the industry got no public subsidy, but costly overruns for new reactors overseas and the exit of several major utilities from the UK programme, most recently Centrica, have driven ministers and officials to backtrack on that pledge and accept they will have to provide financial support. The Guardian has learned that ministers, intent on keeping the guaranteed wholesale cost of each unit of energy below the politically crucial figure of £100 per megawatt hour, are proposing to extend contracts from the 20 years originally envisaged to at least 30 and possibly as long as 40 years. \"To build the full 16GW (gigawatt) at the same price would cost £250bn over 40-year contracts, and over 30-year contracts £150bn,\" said Tom Burke, a founding director of the environmental campaign group E3G. Industry sources believe the likely agreed price for the first project in the pipeline to be contracted on this timescale – two 1.6 GW reactors to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset by the energy company EDF – will be below £100, though not by a large margin. That price, however, is more than double the market price for electricity, and higher than all but the most expensive government forecasts for the future. \"It makes a huge difference if it's 30, 35 or 40 years,\" said one industry source with knowledge of the negotiations. Whitehall sources said they were confident that although the cost of the new reactor would be very high, that will start to fall with subsequent projects, and could fall as low as £55-56 a unit later in the programme. The Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, Martin Horwood, commenting on the threat to extend contracts to 40 years, said: \"Over that timescale it's ludicrous because we should really see renewables come into their own: there's no justification for subsidising nuclear like that.\" At the same time some MPs are concerned that the energy bill, which is being scrutinised by MPs, would allow future governments to give nuclear power stations more money if it was needed, without telling parliament. Suspicion about the clauses in the bill enabling future financial support have been fuelled by industry claims in recent weeks. Vincent de Rivas, chief executive of EDF, told MPs that he wanted the government to guarantee buying all the possible output from the new nuclear plants, not just what was needed. Horwood said he supported most of the bill and the funding mechanism being used, but would be tabling amendments over the financial support being extended to a much older technology like nuclear power – a technology that Lib Dems have traditionally opposed. MPs are also angry about the government's changing rhetoric on subsidies. Since the 2010 promise there would be \"no public subsidy\", ministers have modified it to say no \"unfair\" subsidies – wording intended to cover support for a range of technology. This month the energy secretary, Ed Davey, admitted to MPs the funding mechanism could differ between technologies and even individual projects. Under the proposed funding system, called contracts for difference, companies such as EDF that build and operate nuclear reactors would be guaranteed a minimum \"strike\" price for the energy they generate. If the market price falls below this strike price, the difference will be made up by a surcharge on customer bills; if the market price rises higher then the generator will have to refund the difference. \"This is Jesuitical Casuistry,\" said Paul Flynn, a Labour MP and long time anti-nuclear campaigner. \"He [Davey] is saying there will be a subsidy. Perhaps an enormous subsidy. But you, parliament and the public, will not know what it is until it is too late to change.\" Burke, who is visiting professor at Imperial and University colleges in London, calculated that at just below £100 a unit, if the market price stabilised at £50 – which is below the lowest government forecast market price of £59 in 2030 – EDF would receive £50bn in support from the government over four decades for Hinkley. The government argues that despite the problems getting new nuclear plants built it is essential to keep nuclear power alongside renewable energy and new gas plants to keep prices lower and help reduce the risk of over-relying on one technology. Long term the government hopes to build up to 16GW of new nuclear power to help diversify the energy sources, also including renewable energy and new gas power, to keep prices down and make the UK more resilient to supply problems with one technology. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said in a statement: \"No commitment has been made on commercial terms or a strike price. Ongoing discussions are focused on finding a fair, affordable deal, which represents value for money for consumers. Any agreement reached will be laid before parliament, and will include details of the strike price.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/08/nato-ready-to-deploy-forces-to-defend-turkey-against-any-threats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-08T11:35:39Z","webTitle":"Nato ready to 'defend' Turkey as Russia strikes Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/nato-ready-to-deploy-forces-to-defend-turkey-against-any-threats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/08/nato-ready-to-deploy-forces-to-defend-turkey-against-any-threats","fields":{"headline":"Nato ready to 'defend' Turkey as Russia strikes Syria","bodyText":"Nato is ready to send troops to Turkey to defend against threats on its southern flank, the head of the alliance has said following violations of Turkish airspace by Russian jets conducting airstrikes in Syria. Moscow’s growing military involvement in the Syria conflict – which on Wednesday involved its jets backing an offensive by ground troops loyal to the president, Bashar al-Assad – is expected to be high on the agenda of a meeting of the alliance’s defence ministers. “Nato is ready and able to defend all allies, including Turkey against any threats,” Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general, told reporters before the Brussels meeting on Thursday. “In Syria, we have seen a troubling escalation of Russian military activities. We will assess the latest developments and their implications for the security of the alliance. This is particularly relevant in view of the recent violations of Nato’s airspace by Russian aircraft. “Nato has already responded by increasing our capacity, our ability, our preparedness to deploy forces including to the south, including in Turkey.” The ground offensive backed by Russian airstrikes was an escalation in Moscow’s week-long campaign, which had previously been restricted to bombing runs to soften up rebel positions near major loyalist strongholds. Syria’s chief-of-staff, Gen Ali Ayoub, on Thursday declared that a wide-ranging ground offensive by Syrian troops was under way that he said had been facilitated by Russian airstrikes. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ground forces loyal to the government targeted insurgents in the Ghab plain, with heavy barrages of surface-to-surface missiles as Russian warplanes bombed from above. It also said rebels had shot down a helicopter in Hama province in western Syria. It was unclear if it was Syrian or Russian. The Ghab plain lies next to a mountain range that forms the heartland of Assad’s Alawite sect. Recapturing it from an alliance of rebel groups that includes al-Nusra Front, al-Qaida’s wing in Syria, would help secure Assad’s coastal heartlands and could provide a platform to drive the rebels back from other areas. Most of Wednesday’s fighting appeared to be concentrated in Hama, a central province with a majority Sunni capital that has remained in the hands of the regime since the start of the war. It is key to Assad’s strategy of cementing control over major population centres in a strip of territory from Latakia, in the north, through to Homs, Hama and Damascus. Russia’s air campaign in Syria has caught the US and its allies on the back foot and alarmed Syria’s northern neighbour Turkey, which says its airspace has been repeatedly violated by Russian jets. On Thursday, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, warned Russia that its military action in Syria is endangering trade ties. Erdoğan said Ankara could look elsewhere for gas supplies and cancel the construction of its first nuclear power plant, which is being built by Russia. Russia supplies 60% of Turkey’s gas needs. On Wednesday, Turkey summoned Russia’s ambassador for the third time in four days over the reported airspace violations, which Nato has said appeared to be deliberate and were extremely dangerous. Turkey said Syria-based missile systems harassed its warplanes on Tuesday while eight F-16 jets were on a patrol flight along the Syrian border. The Russian ministry of defence said it was continuing to consult with Turkey to ensure there would be no repetition of the incident. On Wednesday Russian warships fired missiles into Syria from the Caspian Sea for the first time. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said four warships launched 26 rockets at Isis targets. The Syrian push on the ground is the first time Assad’s forces have coordinated with the Russian airforce in an attempt to seize lost territory from opposition forces, leading to some of the fiercest fighting in months in a civil war that has now lasted four and a half years and killed more than 250,000 people. The assault mirrors the US strategy in northern Syria, where coalition planes bombed Isis positions to pave the way for their allies on the ground to advance against the militants. It also poses the question of how much territory the regime’s army, exhausted and depleted by the conflict, can seize from the rebels. The US Department of State repeated accusations that a large majority of Russia’s military strikes in Syria have not been aimed at Isis or jihadis tied to al-Qaida, and have instead targeted the moderate Syrian opposition. “Greater than 90% of the strikes that we’ve seen them take to date have not been against Isil [Isis] or al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists,” said a spokesman, John Kirby. Speaking in Brussels, the US ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, said on Wednesday that Russia’s buildup in Syria now included a “considerable and growing” naval presence, long-range rockets and a battalion of ground troops backed by Moscow’s most modern tanks. He said the Kremlin seemed to be intent on forging a new counter-coalition to the western-Gulf axis, bringing together the Russians, Iranians, Iraqis and Hezbollah behind Assad. Moscow had managed a “quite impressive” military deployment over the past week to its Syrian naval base in Tartus and its army base in Latakia, Lute said. “There is a considerable and growing Russian naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, more than 10 ships now, which is a bit out of the ordinary,” he told a news briefing. “The recent Russian reinforcements over the last week or so feature a battalion-size ground force … There is artillery, there are long-range rocket capabilities, there are air defence capabilities,” Lute said. A battalion is typically made up of about 1,000 soldiers. A senior Turkish official said 18 Russian warships had passed through the Bosphorus strait at Istanbul en route to Moscow’s Syrian base, amid conflicting reports of Russian ground forces also being deployed. Nato diplomats doubted the Russians were preparing any ground operations but were sure that they were training and equipping Assad ground forces and were active on the ground beyond their military bases. “The Iranians are on the ground, but not the Russians yet,” said the Turkish official. The Turkish official and Nato diplomats said the Russians had also deployed air-to-air fighter aircraft, which would not be used for bombing anti-Assad forces, but would engage in dogfights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/05/andrew-adonis-george-osborne-national-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T17:19:05Z","webTitle":"Is Andrew Adonis right to work for George Osborne? | Head to head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/andrew-adonis-george-osborne-national-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/andrew-adonis-george-osborne-national-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Is Andrew Adonis right to work for George Osborne?","bodyText":"Diane Abbott: He failed to see Corbyn coming Andrew Adonis is a very pleasant and extremely capable Blairite. As well as being a card-carrying Blairite, he’s a former chair of the rightwing pressure group Progress. So in some ways it is not surprising that he has jumped ship to work with the Tories as chair of the National Infrastructure Commission. This new quango will advise the government on infrastructure projects like the east-west HS3 rail line; the new north-south Crossrail 2, and a new generation of nuclear power stations. On one hand it is exactly the type of project Adonis is passionate about. But on the other he probably does think that, with the election of Jeremy Corbyn, the world as we know it has come to an end. He has lived his political life surrounded not by ordinary Labour party supporters but by members of the Westminster political class. So everyone he knows entirely failed to see the Corbyn phenomenon coming, had no idea about the yearning of many party members to move on from the Blair years and genuinely sees the election of Jeremy Corbyn as the equivalent of a meteorite colliding with Earth. And Adonis has been dealt a double blow. He has a keen interest in housing and Crossrail 2. These are big London issues. So much so that he considered running for mayor of London himself. Instead he swung his support behind Tessa Jowell. And right up to the end, she and her team believed that she was going to sweep to victory. This was not an unreasonable view. She had much more money than any other candidate, began her campaign earlier, was the media favourite and led in the opinion polls throughout. But instead the Corbyn surge swept the unfortunate Dame Tessa away. So, in one weekend in September, Adonis found himself standing amid the rubble of everything he believed in. I bow to no one in my respect for Lord Adonis and his abilities. He is right to say that “without big improvements to its transport and energy systems, Britain will grind to a halt”, but I only hope he is not let down by his new friend George Osborne. So far the Tory record on infrastructure is a great deal of hype but less actual delivery. Headhunting an erstwhile Labour peer is a great coup for party conference week, but it does not mean that the Tories are any more serious about delivery. Maybe Adonis is right. Maybe the Labour party is effectively dead, and he is right to tiptoe away from the corpse. But in the week following Corbyn’s victory, more than 50,000 people joined Labour; 150,000 have joined as members since its election defeat. These are not the signs of an organisation on its last legs. Almost all the Westminster political class called the result of the Labour leadership contest wrong. And the infrastructure commission is actually a Labour policy. Maybe Adonis is miscalculating which party will be in a position to genuinely deliver on his infrastructure plans soonest. John McTernan: Plagiarism is the greatest compliment for Labour In 2020 there will be only one answer to the question “Who is the most successful Labour politician of the last decade?” Back will come the cry “Andrew Adonis”. Academies, his transformational reinvention of state schooling, will be 20 years old by then. And he will be into his fifth year as chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, well down the line of sketching – and building – the modern Britain we need. There has been no greater signal of the Tory party’s intention than the signing of Adonis. While the Labour party is away with the fairies, the Tories intend to consolidate their grip on Britain. The Labour party’s response to the Adonis appointment has completely missed the point. Some are clearly trying to wrap it into a narrative of Blairites defecting – though Adonis has resigned the Labour whip and not the party (indeed, with Corbyn’s new pluralistic leadership, some might question what whip there is to resign from). But the official response is grudging and tin-eared, saying that this is all a smokescreen to protect the Tories from criticism over cutting tax credits. What was really needed from Labour was a full-throated endorsement of Adonis’s appointment. Labour should have claimed, rightly, intellectual dominance. Not only is the National Infrastructure Commission a Labour idea – it was the invention of Gordon Brown himself – it needs a Labour figure to chair it. Labour not only has the ideas for the future – it has the personnel too. That Labour hasn’t done this is of a piece with its confusion over Osborne’s snatching of the living wage. Political plagiarism is the greatest compliment but the chancellor’s audacious announcement was greeted by a sullen Labour response that feels halfway between “he doesn’t mean it” and “it’s not fair, he does mean it”. Lack of self-confidence is a killer in politics. The Labour party is cowering where it should be swaggering. A former Labour adviser – Simon Stevens – is needed to save the NHS. A Miliband idea – the living wage – is core to the Tory claim to be the party of working people. Now a Labour peer, and former cabinet minister is needed to sort out vital infrastructure. Bragging rights for ever, for any party not slumped in navel-gazing. An opportunity missed for Labour, but not for Adonis. He is one of the most restless thinkers on the left. A man whose intelligence is only matched by his compassion. That combination leads to only one thing – a bias to action. It was always clear that Andrew was not going to languish on the back benches through another five years of opposition. He would have been a great deputy mayor for Tessa Jowell and, in due course, a great mayor himself. Now he will have just as big a job – in effect the mayor of England. The alignment of planning, economic development and infrastructure is critical not just to the country’s future prosperity but to social justice too. Adonis knows that new roads, railways and power stations are not just projects in themselves; they are the engine of economic change. They take jobs to people, but they take people to jobs too. The government are lucky to have him. As is the country. The great legacies of politics are institutional – the NHS, the state pension, academy schools. Few are the politicians who get that fact, fewer still the ones who know what to do about it, and fewest of all those who can then succeed. Adonis is in that number. When this modest social democrat succeeds in planning and delivering Britain’s future – as he will – it will be a great moment for the country. And a modest victory for social democracy in a very cold climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/05/lord-adonis-to-resign-labour-whip-and-chair-george-osbornes-infrastructure-body","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-04T23:01:10Z","webTitle":"Lord Adonis to resign Labour whip and chair George Osborne's infrastructure body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/05/lord-adonis-to-resign-labour-whip-and-chair-george-osbornes-infrastructure-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/05/lord-adonis-to-resign-labour-whip-and-chair-george-osbornes-infrastructure-body","fields":{"headline":"Lord Adonis to resign Labour whip and chair George Osborne's infrastructure body","bodyText":"One of Labour’s pre-eminent thinkers is to resign his party’s whip in the House of Lords after being recruited by George Osborne to head a newly created National Infrastructure Commission.Andrew Adonis, Tony Blair’s former policy chief, will sit as a cross-bench peer to allow him to chair the new statutory body that will advise the government on new infrastructure projects. The chancellor – addressing the Conservative party conference on Monday – will hail the appointment of Lord Adonis as a sign of his determination to occupy what David Cameron has called the “common ground” as the Labour party “runs to the hills” under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Osborne will seek to portray the Tories as the real “workers’ party” in his speech to the Tory conference on Monday, where he is expected to reiterate his announcement in his summer budget of a “national living wage” that is due to rise to £9 an hour by 2020 for workers over the age of 25. The poaching of such a high-profile New Labour figure – the father of Blair’s schools academy programme and of the HS2 rail line – will be seen as a highly political move by the chancellor as he follows the former Labour prime minister’s “big tent” approach as a way of occupying the centre ground. “I think you can see what Andrew Adonis thinks of Labour’s prospects under Jeremy Corbyn by this move,” said one Tory source. Treasury sources added the appointment of Adonis was designed to take the politics out of infrastructure projects as the government seeks to create a permanent and wide-ranging body, in the mould of the Davies commission that examined airport expansion. This suggests the chancellor is keen to endorse the findings of the independent commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, which recommended the building of a third runway at Heathrow. A spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn said: “We have heard it all before from Osborne and the Conservatives on infrastructure and their record is one of complete failure to deliver. There is still nothing to indicate that the Tories understand the desperate need for serious long-term investment in infrastructure - and the real story of their conference remains their attack on working people through the cut on tax credits.” Adonis was a member of the SDP before moving to the Labour party, where he served as head of Blair’s No 10 policy unit in his first term in office before his elevation to the House of Lords. He served as schools minister under Blair and was promoted to the cabinet as transport secretary by Gordon Brown to allow him to indulge his love of railways. Downing Street and the Treasury know they are vulnerable to concerns raised by a series of Tories, including the influential thinker and former minister David Willetts, about plans to cut tax credits by an average of £1,000 a year for three million of the poorest working families. Lord Willetts warned in the Times last week that the changes could “turn sour”. Willetts spoke out after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was “arithmetically impossible” for the new national living wage to compensate low-paid workers for the cut in tax credits. The prime minister said the average family, whose main breadwinner works full time on the minimum wage, would be better off by some £2,400 a year when all the tax changes were taken into account. Cameron told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: “We are protecting the lowest-paid people with the child tax credit and what goes with it.” The new commission, which will be modelled on the independent fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility, set up in legislation after the 2010 election, will advise the government on which infrastructure projects should be prioritised. These will cover roads and rail, including the east-west HS3 rail line, the new north-south Crossrail 2 line linking Surrey and Hertfordshire, and energy projects such as the new generation of nuclear power stations. Adonis wrote a major report for Labour in the last parliament on how to revive Britain’s cities outside London. But he was frustrated the leadership was slow to follow on his ideas and watched with envy how Osborne drew on the thinking of the former deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, which provided the template for the chancellor’s “northern powerhouse”. The appointment of Adonis to the new infrastructure commission shows the chancellor is so confident politically that he is not averse to stealing ideas from Labour. Ed Miliband pledged to establish an almost identical commission in the Labour manifesto for this year’s general election. This was modelled on the Armitt commission established by Ed Balls in 2012, to examine how to speed up infrastructure projects. John Armitt’s work was undermined the following year when Balls questioned the HS2 project, sending Labour’s northern municipal leaders into the arms of Osborne. Adonis will say: “Without big improvements to its transport and energy systems, Britain will grind to a halt. I am pleased to accept the chancellor’s invitation to establish the National Infrastructure Commission as an independent body able to advise government and parliament on priorities. “Major infrastructure projects like Crossrail and building major new power stations span governments and parliaments. I hope it will be possible to forge a wide measure of agreement, across society and politics, on key infrastructure requirements for the next 20 to 30 years, and the assessments which have underpinned them.” The chancellor will say in his speech: “I am delighted to tell you that the former Labour cabinet minister and transport secretary Andrew Adonis has agreed to be the commission’s first chair. He’ll now sit as a cross-bench peer and help us create Britain’s plan for the future – working together in the national interest.” Osborne will add: “Where would Britain be if we had never built railways or runways, power stations or new homes? Where will we be in the future if we stop building them now? I’m not prepared to to turn to my children – or indeed anyone else’s child – and say: I’m sorry, we didn’t build for you. We have to shake Britain out of its inertia on the projects that matter most.” In his speech, Osborne will announce that he will encourage the 89 local authority pension funds to invest in infrastructure projects by pooling their resources into half a dozen British Wealth Funds. They will each control assets of more than £25bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/29/springwatch-has-high-drama-it-doesnt-need-soap-opera-twists","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T17:39:26Z","webTitle":"Springwatch has high drama, it doesn't need soap opera twists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/29/springwatch-has-high-drama-it-doesnt-need-soap-opera-twists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/29/springwatch-has-high-drama-it-doesnt-need-soap-opera-twists","fields":{"headline":"Springwatch has high drama, it doesn't need soap opera twists","bodyText":"British spring now starts up to three weeks earlier than it used to, according to research conducted for the 2015 run of BBC2’s Springwatch. This is unfortunate for the show, which already rather distorts the natural calendar. Springwatch traditionally begins around eight weeks after the start of British Summertime and will conclude in mid-June, which most people call summer. The best explanation for this oddity is that, in another sign of BBC cuts, the seasons have been reduced to three – there are Autumnwatch and Winterwatch spin-offs, but no Summerwatch. After numerous rotations over the years, including the extinction of Bill Oddie and Kate Humble, the presenting team is now Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan – who spend most of the time in or outside a studio-hide at the RSPB nature reserve in Minsmere, Suffolk – and Martin Hughes-Games, who does the danger-money stuff, fronting segments from a plane or up a tree. As is now common on adult factual television, the hosts seem to be encouraged to treat the viewers like children with ADHD. The presenters wave hello and goodbye and conduct hysterical introductory discussions about what they’ve got coming up: “What a series it’s going to be!” / “Yeah! It’s not exactly Game of Thrones, but I’d watch it!” Though disowned in that quotation, Game of Thrones – or TV drama in general – is openly the tone for which the show is going. “Drama, death and delight – it’s like a mini-series!” promised Strachan one night, cueing up a reel of previous highlights that began with the deep-voiced TV drama trailer phrase: “Previously on Springwatch ...” The latest report on a hawk was said to contain “dramatic twists in his soap-opera plotline.” Revealingly, the creatures featured are referred to throughout as “characters” or even “superheroes”, and given names such as “Sophia La Wren” and “Simon the Stickleback”, updates on whom included the news that “spineless Simon has still not had much success with the ladies”. The presenters speculated about “which one of our characters will become the star of the series”. That question was soon answered by the inevitable revelation: “Simon the Stickleback has his own Twitter account!” Avoiding comment on the ominous white dome of the Sizewell B nuclear power station that is visible in many of the panoramic shots, the hosts maintain a jokey, upbeat tone wherever possible. But there’s an obvious problem with turning wildlife into actors in that they, unlike human performers (with the exception of a few it would be legally unwise to cite) are far from guaranteed to get through the shoot. Simon and Sophia La Wren might fall to predators before the end of week three. It would be intriguing to see how this adult show with an insistently kiddish tone would deal with that. But, beneath the often irksome words, the pictures are thrilling, and the technology improves each season: “We’ve now got a water-vole camera, which has been providing us with much more than we thought.” We see a swift inside its nesting box, and a stone curlew in closeup – Disney nicknames and anthropomorphic storylines (“sparrowhawk v goshawk: who’s fastest?”) aren’t necessary, because the images are already high-drama without them. And, refreshingly, Springwatch is unusual among current BBC leisure shows in the absolute avoidance of double entendre. Whereas The Great British Bake Off has now essentially become a vehicle for sneaky parallels between making cakes and making love – and even the Chelsea flower show coverage sometimes meaningfully wobbles over the word “forking” – it is vital that the presenters of Springwatch never acknowledge any oddness in the fact that they are the only people outside of Carry On movies contractually required to deliver sentences in which the only noun is “tit”. Springwatch is on BBC2 at 8pm, Monday to Thursday, until 11 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/05/nuclear-deterrence-accident-weapons-britain-jeremy-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"It's time to leave the nuclear hall of mirrors | David Shariatmadari","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/nuclear-deterrence-accident-weapons-britain-jeremy-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/nuclear-deterrence-accident-weapons-britain-jeremy-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"It's time to leave the nuclear hall of mirrors","bodyText":"“Nuclear weapons can wipe out life on Earth, if used properly.” Despite being found in the liner notes of a Talking Heads album, this is the sentence I think best captures the bizarre contradictions of the atomic age. Human beings have manufactured bombs explicitly designed to unleash destructive forces equivalent to hundreds of thousands of tonnes of TNT. Deploy them and millions die; civilisation as we know it could disappear. And yet, they’re not actually supposed to be used. In fact, their proper function is to remain in the ground, or at sea, or in the air. Launch, fire or drop ‘em and the whole system has failed. Is there any other device so intricately constructed in order to decrease the likelihood of its own use? Last week, Jeremy Corbyn, a man with at least a chance of being entrusted with the launch codes for 225 British warheads, stated that he would never press the nuclear button. I asked philosopher Jonathan Glover, whose book Humanity: A Moral History of the 20th Century, includes a study of the Cuban missile crisis, about the comments. He confirmed most analyses so far. “On the assumption that if he’s PM he has full say, that would indeed get rid of any deterrence”. In other words, were Corbyn to gain power, those weapons would become immediately impotent. His shadow defence secretary, Maria Eagle, called the remarks “unhelpful”. Corbyn had let the air out of the nuclear balloon, given the game away. Despite what David Cameron said yesterday: “There are circumstances in which its use would be justified” – the truth is that no one is going to press the big red button – not Cameron, not George Osborne, Theresa May or whoever follows him. To do so would either be grossly disproportionate (against a non-nuclear state) invite our own destruction (against a nuclear-armed one) or be grossly immoral (a futile retaliation against civilians). But the important thing isn’t to say so. What Corbyn’s intervention did was immediately change the strategic value of Trident. He may not have got his debate on the question of its renewal at party conference, but that didn’t matter: he’d realised a simple way of pursuing unilateral disarmament was to use a handful of magic words. That’s only possible because of the peculiar nature of deterrence. For a while after the end of the second world war, America was the sole nuclear power, but the Soviets soon caught up. It rapidly became clear that preventing war from taking place at all should take priority over making sure you could win. To this end, a doctrine of mutual assured destruction emerged. If either side initiated a nuclear conflict, it could expect to be met with an overwhelming response in kind. Planners therefore focused on making sure their capacity to retaliate would not be wrecked by any first strike – and that the counterpunch would be crippling, targeting civilians in cities, rather than just military installations. Glover points me in the direction of a paper by Gregory Kavka which famously sets out some of the paradoxes of deterrence. Chief among them is the following: it’s a given that any rational person would want to avoid war by deterring his or her enemies. But in the case of nuclear arms, retaliation – whereby, in response to half the world being destroyed, you decide to destroy the other half – would not only be morally inexcusable, but irrational. Welcome to the nuclear hall of mirrors. Despite such contradictions, at the height of the cold war, Soviet and western citizens essentially played the role of hostages to each other’s militaries. Kill us and we’ll kill you, ran the logic. The danger had to be seen to be clear and present, so the number and sophistication of nuclear weapons shot up. In 1986 the global nuclear arsenal comprised more than 60,000 warheads. Since the end of the cold war it has rapidly diminished, but there are still about 10,000, the vast bulk of which belong to the US and Russia. This is a depressing situation. Some argue that the presence of nuclear weapons has prevented large-scale conventional wars. That’s possible, but impossible to prove. In any case, there have been many significant conflicts fought as proxies for the real thing. These have cost millions of lives. And there’s one thing that deterrence doesn’t protect against – the possibility of nuclear accident. Cold war strategists tended to neglect the possibility that a nuclear war might be triggered not by geopolitics, but by simple cock-up. An accidental explosion could be interpreted by the other side as an act of aggression, provoking a full-scale response. Given that weapons systems were often placed on hair-trigger alert, the possibility of a false signal leading to Armageddon was quite real. And though the likelihood of a deliberate nuclear conflict has receded, it’s not clear that the risk of accident has. Some theorists now argue for a staged progression towards zero nuclear weapons. Whether or not this is realistic is a matter of fierce debate. What’s certain is that we’ve got far more nukes than we “need”. One thousand warheads apiece would be more than enough to achieve minimum deterrence between Russia and the US. Glover, however, is unconvinced. “If you’re worried about the danger of accidental nuclear war, as no doubt we should be, then it’s actually much safer if you’ve got the formula in the lab, but don’t actually have the dangerous weapons on the runway.” He continues: “Ideally, there’d be an agreement not to have them at all. Nothing is foolproof in this area: they can’t be uninvented. But a monitoring system to prevent their re-emergence is probably, while fallible, no more fallible and much less worrying than the danger of accidental war.” He tells me that he agrees with what Corbyn says and wouldn’t feel unsafe in a country that didn’t have its own nuclear weapons, like Sweden. “It doesn’t seem to be that anyone is seriously threatening a nuclear attack on us – the only people who might be are terrorists who manage to acquire them. But I suspect they’re not the sort of people that you can deter.” If a world without nuclear weapons is achievable, it will require political leadership.

The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said the robot stopped moving on Friday during its first inspection of the containment vessel inside reactor No 1, one of the three reactors that suffered meltdown after the plant was struck by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Tepco, which recently conceded that the technology for robots to retrieve the nuclear fuel had yet to be developed, said on Monday it would cut the cables to the stranded robot and postpone a similar inspection using a separate device. Developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, the robot was supposed to be able to function for about 10 hours even when exposed to radiation at levels that would cause ordinary electronic devices to malfunction. The “transformer” robot, which can alter its shape depending on its surroundings, was sent in to photograph the inside of the reactor containment vessel and record temperatures and radiation levels. It had covered 14 of 18 locations when it stalled, about three hours after it began its journey around the vessel, officials said, adding that they had yet to establish the cause of the problem. More than four years after Fukushima Daiichi suffered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier, radiation levels inside the three reactors are still far too high for humans to enter. Tepco is pinning its hopes on a new generation of remote-controlled robots, the first of which will monitor the state and location of the melted fuel before others remove it from the reactors’ outer containers. Last year the dangers posed by high radiation forced Tepco and the government to delay the planned start of fuel removal from reactor No 1 by five years, to 2025. Decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi is expected to take at least 40 years and cost tens of billions of dollars. Dale Klein, a former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission who now advises Tepco, said dangerously high radiation inside the three damaged reactors had made extracting the melted cores particularly difficult. “Radiation levels in these structures is higher, and working inside them is problematic,” Klein said recently. “This is a challenge that has never been faced before in the world, and there will have to be new equipment developed to make that happen. “There’s an inherent advantage to the technology that exists here in in Japan to develop those new skills and techniques,” given its expertise in robot technology, Klein added. “Those tools and equipment do not exist today, but the fundamental knowledge of robotic, remotely controlled devices will, I think, be sufficient.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/08/european-commission-approves-hinkley-point-nuclear-subsidy-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T12:45:07Z","webTitle":"European commission approves Hinkley Point nuclear subsidy deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/08/european-commission-approves-hinkley-point-nuclear-subsidy-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/08/european-commission-approves-hinkley-point-nuclear-subsidy-deal","fields":{"headline":"European commission approves Hinkley Point nuclear subsidy deal","bodyText":"The European commission (EC) on Wednesday gave the green light to a subsidy scheme that will enable the first new nuclear reactors to be built in Britain for nearly 20 years. But the EC claimed that the decision had been made only after the financial arrangements put forward by the UK had been substantially modified to save cash for the British taxpayer. The majority decision by a full assembly of 28 commissioners is the last regulatory hurdle for EDF Energy and its £16bn plan to construct Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. The Austrian representative spoke out against the deal and his country has previously promised to launch legal action to halt the scheme – the first since Sizewell B was built in Suffolk. Joaquín Almunia, the EC’s vice-president in charge of competition policy, earlier oversaw a stinging report criticising the Hinkley subsidy arrangements from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). But today he said: “After the commission’s intervention, the UK measures in favour of Hinkley Point nuclear power station have been significantly modified, limiting any distortions of competition in the single market. “These modifications will also achieve significant savings for UK taxpayers. On this basis and after a thorough investigation, the commission can now conclude that the support is compatible with EU state aid rules.” There was little explanation from the EC on what exactly had been changed, argued critics. The basic deal allowsthe French-owned electricity generator to be guaranteed £92.50 per megawatt hour over the 35-year life of the Hinkley plant. This subsidy, twice the current price of electricity, will be paid out of household energy bills. Greenpeace said the EC move was a “world record sell-out” to the nuclear industry at the expense of taxpayers and the environment. “It’s such a distortion of competition rules that the commission has left itself exposed to legal challenges,” said Greenpeace EU legal adviser Andrea Carta. “There is absolutely no legal, moral or environmental justification in turning taxes into guaranteed profits for a nuclear power company whose only legacy will be a pile of radioactive waste. This is a bad plan for everyone except EDF.” But Lord Hutton of Furness, chairman of the British Nuclear Industry Association, said he was pleased. “This is an important step in securing the UK’s home-grown low-carbon electricity generation, while adding jobs and prosperity to the economy.” Commenting on the future for nuclear subsidies, Ed Davey, UK energy and climate change secretary, said: “All low carbon [power] at the moment, whether its nuclear, carbon capture and storage, offshore wind etc. is getting support. The question is can we reduce that support as quickly as possible and that is what the electricity market reform is designed to do. “Do I think it will go to zero [subsidies]? I don’t know, because I can’t tell the future. But what I do know is that, with the mechanism we’ve got, it will reduce the cost of supporting low-carbon, in all its different forms, to the lowest imaginable because we are bringing in competition in the market. “We are in the early stages of decarbonisation and taking a low-carbon option off the table now doesn’t look terribly clever.” EDF, in cooperation with the Chinese is at the forefront of plans to build new reactors, but other companies have also made clear they want to follow suit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/oct/07/eu-nuclear-deal-will-hit-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-07T18:52:15Z","webTitle":"EU nuclear deal will hit renewables | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/07/eu-nuclear-deal-will-hit-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/oct/07/eu-nuclear-deal-will-hit-renewables","fields":{"headline":"EU nuclear deal will hit renewables","bodyText":"Today (8 October) the 28-strong outgoing European commission will make a decision on the Hinkley C financial deal, with far-reaching consequences both for the integrity of decision-making in Europe and for the future of European energy policy (Conflict of interest concerns over EDF’s Hinkley nuclear project approval, 1 October). In December 2013, the commission raised doubts on almost all aspects of the project, finding the state credit guarantee of £10bn for EDF “incompatible under EU state aid rules”. So why is competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia, backed by former EU president José Manuel Barroso, recommending the commission give the deal the green light? Could it be that the German federal government has been involved in a backroom deal? The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has previously achieved exemptions from EU subsidy rules for Germany’s ambitious renewable energy plans. The legislation behind this, which provides feed-in incentives for renewable energy technologies, is helping transform energy generation away from fossil fuels and nuclear; renewables now account for around 30% of Germany’s electricity. However, in return for these subsidy exemptions, Merkel is rumoured to have agreed to support British nuclear subsidies. So, while the Berlin government is decommissioning its own nuclear power plants and turning to renewables, it is at the same time undermining nuclear phase-out across the rest of Europe. Greens in the European parliament urge departing commissioners to hold fast to their principled opposition to this extremely dodgy deal and set all of Europe, not just Germany, on course for an energy policy for the common good.

Amid the condemnation of Russia and promises to curtail Putin's influence on energy supplies, there are continuing plans to have the Russians build a nuclear power station in the UK. Hergen Haye, the head of new nuclear development at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, outlined the scheme to Edinburgh University students. He arrived in truth-telling mood. \"I hope no one is recording this,\" he said. \"You can't really trust a politician for longer than five years, as that's when the next election is.\" Politicos, they constantly change tack, Haye complained, citing Angela Merkel after Fukushima. This discourages investment. Haye, who is German, told of a hostility to nuclear in his homeland and said his role promoting it in the UK means he is never fully embraced there, even by his own family. \"They throw things at me and call me immoral,\" he said. \"But they still love me.\" Debatable on its face, but he must know. • Much debate in parliament about our response to Russia and Putin and his apparent annexation of Crimea. With that in mind, MPs voted on Wednesday for a new chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia. Labour's Chris Bryant, who served in that capacity before being ousted in a Conservative coup, was expected to seek a robust line. His new rival, the former Tory whip John Randall, was seen as less confrontational. And after a vote, and a spirited Tory whipping operation, MPs chose the Randall path – by 126 votes to 96. The significance will not have been lost on Putin's diplomats in London. Panic over. As you were. • Biographer John Campbell's revelation that 1960s Labour intellectual heavyweights and womanisers Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland also managed a youthful affair with each other came as less than a shock to peers of the world. Some this week recalled the occasion when Lib Dem lords were agonising over the right attitude to sex in the armed forces. Former army captain Lord Jenkins, by then a Lib Dem grandee, couldn't understand the fuss because so many great British generals had been gay. \"Being in the army is like parading in front of debutantes,\" he told them. He led many departments - the Home Office, the Treasury. Wise heads kept him from defence. • Happy days, meanwhile, for Margaret Hodge, whose public accounts committee serves as public executioner to those who waste taxpayers' money. The great and good come before her and, like the end-of-days scene in the book of Revelations, all depart shorn of grandeur. The public benefit is clear, but what does Hodge get out of it? She gets what is thought to be the biggest office available to a backbencher in Westminster. Spacious, airy, practically imperial, it grandly overlooks the Thames. She sees all sin from there. • Guy Garvey of thoughtful rockers Elbow discusses artistic integrity in ShortList magazine. Many stars prostitute their oeuvre to commercialism and Mammon; Garvey is wary. He reveals that Hovis asked to use one of the band's songs in an advert. Garvey refused. \"Peter Jobson, the bass player from I Am Kloot and my very good friend, said, 'What's going on? Fucking good northern brand – what's the matter with you?' I said I wasn't comfortable with it – it's a big song, and it means a lot to people.\" Jobson replied: \"For as long as I can remember it's been Dvorak's 9th Symphony on those adverts.\" No one calls Dvorak a dirty sellout, Jobson observed.

One senior figure reckons the press gallery thinks the new prime minister “farts rainbows”. Without getting rude about it, Turnbull is enjoying a protracted honeymoon. And it is true his particular style of intelligent reasonableness, professed reluctance to engage in crude partisan politics before doing just that, does appear to overwhelm some listeners’ critical faculties. Asked about Australia’s future energy sources this week, Turnbull expounded the indisputable proposition that we should be rational and businesslike, rather than irrational and “ideological” about our choices. He put it like this: “Some people talk about it in an ideological way, as though one type of coal is better or worse than wind which is better or worse than solar which is better or worse than nuclear power. “These are all things. They don’t have any moral characteristics ... coal, depending on where it is, can be cheap but has higher emissions. Nuclear energy has low emissions but is hugely expensive to construct and has a number of obviously very big environmental problems associated with it ... and so on down the list. The appropriate … way to deal with this is to be, I think, to be thoroughly rational about it and to say the object is to make sure we have access to all of the energy we need at the cheapest possible price.” This caused some observers to purr the new prime minister had hit a “practical mainstream” sweetspot with climate policy, when it fact it was a masterclass in just how good he is at avoiding the question. Because if we just wanted energy at the cheapest possible price we’d just keep burning brown coal. The whole point of the climate debate we’ve been having this past decade or so has been how we reduce the emissions from power generation and how to calculate and factor in the environmental cost of coal generation. We were going to use a carbon price but that ended badly for the country and for Turnbull. Now the prime minister points out, quite correctly, that a carbon price is just one means to an end, but the Coalition’s current policy is actually helping the dirtiest brown-coal generation – emissions from brown coal generators grew by 6.2% in the year to March 2015, part of the overall increase in emissions from the electricity sector. The renewable energy target is capped and the extraordinary advances in battery storage technology are going to take a while to be cost competitive with coal-fired grid power if there are no carbon constraints. In fact, as his policy stands, there is nothing to stop emissions from the power sector continuing to rise. Turnbull gets this and may well be working on a policy answer, but until we hear it his practical mainstream means practically nothing. Oh, and just quietly, there is a pretty big moral dimension to the question of slowing global warming. That said, it’s reasonable for Turnbull to avoid questions for a little while longer, and when they stop gnashing their teeth for a moment Labor knows it. He can’t be expected to make considered changes and also to announce them straight away. Adding to the frustration, Labor has completely ditched its attack on Abbott as an incompetent ideological throwback with no good ideas for Australia’s future. Turnbull’s own qualities and all his talk about a nimble, agile nation springing into new opportunities like the economic equivalent of an Olympic gymnast has sent those lines to the cutting room floor. Labor’s only option now is the hard grind of policy detail – their own, and forensically analysing the fine print of Turnbull’s when it comes, which isn’t likely to be until the economic update and the innovation review at the end of the year. Given Turnbull’s obvious problems balancing any changes to his climate policy with the sceptical views on the right of his party that is an obvious early area of attack and Shorten will try to build pressure in the lead up to the December climate conference in Paris, which both he and Turnbull will attend. Next week the Labor leader will tour Pacific Islands, a few weeks after that he has scheduled a major address at the Lowy Institute to outline Labor’s stance on the international talks. Ruled out by almost all senior Labor figures is the option of changing the leader because of the difficulties of the new grassroots leadership selection rules imposed by Kevin Rudd, because Labor understands it has resorted to leadership assassination a few times too often and because most of the alternative leaders aren’t ready yet and probably calculate their best interests lie in having a shot after the next election, on the assumption Turnbull will win it. And that leaves Labor backing in and shoring up a leader who is the preferred prime minister of just 17% of the population and who was already suffering a crisis of confidence even when Labor was leading the polls. Stand by for a lot of talk about the team. The contrast with the new prime minister, who is so confident, so certain in his grasp on power, could not be greater. Labor has no choice but to concentrate on the policy detail because the more the election is a presidential-style contest of charisma and personality the worse Shorten is likely to fare. Reading Kerry O’Brien’s biography of Paul Keating this week highlights the whiff of Keating in the new prime minister’s style. Like Keating, Turnbull worked and waited for power and fully intends to put it to good use. Like Keating, he has always seemed to see the “game” of politics as a means to an end. And like Keating he is supremely confident that he knows best what that end, that vision for the nation, should be. They share big ideas about national identity, a bit of what Keating used to call his “dash and elan”. When Turnbull was thinking about leaving politics after his party dumped him as leader in 2009, Keating was reportedly one of those who advised him against it because he thought Turnbull was the kind of politician the parliament needed. And Keating said recently if Turnbull is allowed to govern as he wants to, without too much hindrance from the Liberal conservative right, he will present big strategic problems for the Labor Party. And Twitter reminded me this week of a question I asked Turnbull when he addressed the National Press Club in 1992 on behalf of the Australian Republican Movement. Keating, then prime minister, had backed a republic but not said how he thought Australia should get there. I asked Turnbull whether he thought Keating should have spelled out the detail. “Frankly, I am awestruck by Keating’s courage. Keating is the first mainstream politician to put his toe in this pool and he should be congratulated for his courage,” Turnbull replied. In O’Brien’s book, Keating constantly describes political capital as a resource, replenished by popularity and drawn down by real, brave leaders who know the big changes they want to make and are prepared to take risks to get there. Leadership courage – the quality Turnbull and Keating seem to admire in one another – burns through political capital much more quickly than leaders who stay safe, as Keating discovered. Keating had already used a lot of his capital before he took the prime minstership. Turnbull is starting with close to a full tank. Labor may be gnashing teeth for a while."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/dec/01/argentina-president-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-patagonia-hydroelectric-dam-project","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-01T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"Argentina leader leaves controversial legacy with Patagonia dams project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/01/argentina-president-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-patagonia-hydroelectric-dam-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/dec/01/argentina-president-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-patagonia-hydroelectric-dam-project","fields":{"headline":"Argentina leader leaves controversial legacy with Patagonia dams project","bodyText":"As the presidency of Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner enters its final days, her greatest – and arguably most controversial – legacy project is just getting under way in the remote grasslands of Patagonia. Here, amid herds of wild guanacos, condor nests and the occasional rhea, a Chinese-financed team of engineers will soon be dynamiting hillsides and pouring millions of tonnes of concrete for two giant hydroelectric dams that will flood an area the size of Buenos Aires. The massive structures – spanning three kilometres (almost two miles) at the widest point – will transform Santa Cruz state, bringing jobs, money and development to the heartland of Kirchnerism – but also raising concerns about the growing influence of China and the effects on a region famed for its milky blue waters and spectacular glaciers. Although the environmental impact study for the $5.7bn scheme has yet to be announced and approved, preparatory work is already well under way beside the Santa Cruz river valley once explored by Charles Darwin. Dozens of huge Chinese dump trucks and drilling machines are now parked in the middle of the vast plain. Shafts and tunnels are being dug into the slopes near the main site. And a base camp – with canteens, game rooms and portable dormitories that still smell of fresh paint – has been established in the semi-wilderness. The conditions make it tough. In winter, temperatures can fall below -20C (-4F) and the ground is often buried under snow. “The main challenge is coping with Patagonia – because of the cold, the wind and the distances involved,” says Néstor Ayala, the chief of construction at the site. “If you are short a single screw, you have to go 300km to the nearest hardware store.” A few hundred workers are living at the site already, but within a year Ayala expects this temporary community to grow into a small town of more than 5,000 people. Cristina – as the president is best known here – will step down on 10 December, but the Kirchner name, fame and notoriety will live on in both the dam and its social, political and environmental consequences. True to her Peronist ideals, it is an ambitious nation-building, job-creating edifice. With an installed capacity of 1.7 gigawatts, the hydropower plant will be the biggest solely inside Argentina (there are larger dams, but they cross borders and are shared with neighbours). Fernández has described it as “the most important hydroelectric project” in the country’s history. Yet this is also a profoundly dynastic project. One of the two dams will be called the Néstor Kirchner, after the president’s deceased husband and predecessor in office. The region that will benefit most from the flood of hydropower cash and jobs is the Kirchners’ political heartland of Santa Cruz state. The president has a home in the nearest town, El Calafate, and owns several local hotels. Her sister-in-law Alicia has just been elected state governor and her son Máximo has secured a congressional seat here. “People in Santa Cruz are grateful that Cristina put this place at the centre of political debate after decades of it being seen as the end of the world,” said local journalist Ernesto Castillo. But approval is far from universal. Critics say the project is being rushed into being before the end of the president’s term despite its immense geostrategic and environmental implications. Chinese banks are providing the financing: China Gezhouba Group will build the dam with an Argentinian partner Electroingenieria and then operate it for 20 years. After that, the dams will be handed over to the state government. It is the biggest of several huge investments that were agreed last year in a summit between Fernández and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Other projects include two railways and a contentious satellite tracking base in Patagonia, which gives the Chinese military a space monitoring station in Argentina. There are also plans for China to build a nuclear power plant, although Fernández’s centre-right successor, Mauricio Macri, has pledged to review this decision. Stronger links with China are in keeping both with the Peronist strategy of playing off superpowers against one another, and a more recent regional trend that has seen several governments in Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, forge closer ties with Beijing. In the case of the dam project, this has prompted alarm bordering on xenophobia. In an echo of the “yellow peril” prejudices of the past, some in sparsely populated Patagonia fear an influx of Chinese settlers. These concerns are ill-founded. Only 150 Chinese engineers will work on the project, less than 4% of the entire workforce. Of greater significance is the debate about whether Argentina is being sold short. Ariel Slipak, an economist at the Moreno University, said the president was guilty of short-term thinking in the deals she struck with Xi that will ultimately prove no better than the country’s older unbalanced ties with the US and Europe. He believes China is financing the hydropower plant to ease energy shortages in Argentina so that it can import more oil from the country. The benefits, he said, would be for the business elite in both countries, while the consequences would be felt long after the change of president. “Cristina’s legacy is to create a new relationship of dependency on China,” he said. “China is not looking for a quick profit here. They are making a geostrategic move to secure resources.” In return, Argentina will get investment and another source of power – but not necessarily the one that suits its needs or geography. Environmental groups believe that instead of a giant dam, it would make far more sense to develop alternative energies in a region that is famous for gusts. “Santa Cruz could be the Kuwait of wind power,” said Emiliano Ezcurra of the Banco de Bosques (Forest Bank) environmental organisation. “Cristina could leave a legacy of breakthrough environmental technology. Instead, she’ll leave behind a horrible scar on our beautiful land.” The greatest concern is the likely impact on wildlife and scenery. Santiago Imberti, a local conservationist, said the dam would flood the breeding and wintering sites of tens of thousands of birds, including the highly endangered hooded grebe – a native species of which there are only 800 left. Conservation groups launched a legal challenge against the project in October. They claim it was launched without the necessary environmental impact assessment; that it violates the national park law, which prohibits developments in protected areas; and that it is contrary to the glacier protection law, which forbids any activity that threatens the nation’s ice fields. Fears have focused on the Perito Moreno glacier, a world heritage site and one of Argentina’s best-loved tourist attractions. Located an hour’s drive from El Calafate, the blue and white forest of frozen and gnarled crags stretches from distant mountains down to the turquoise waters of Lake Argentino. Every two to 12 years, the glacier blocks the lake until it ruptures spectacularly, drawing hordes of visitors. There have been worries that the dams could disrupt this cycle. Geraldo Bartolomé, a civil engineer, launched an online petition arguing that the constant lifting and falling of the reservoir water level would erode the ice bridge. After he collected more than 60,000 signatures, the dam’s designers reconfigured the project so that the reservoir would not connect to Lake Argentino. This should protect the glacier, but Bartolomé remains concerned that the project is being pushed through without due consideration for the consequences. “No serious environmental study has been done,” he said. “I’m an engineer. I’m not against progress. But they have to prove they are not affecting the glacier.” This is denied by Electroingenieria. But regardless of the impact on the ice, the controversy over the dams looks set to rage on long after Fernández leaves the presidential palace and moves back to El Calafate. In the years ahead, Patagonia will be opened up like never before. More settlers will arrive. More accommodation will be needed. Roads will have to be improved. A new high-tension power transmission line will be necessary to link the hydropower plants to Buenos Aires, 1,900 miles away. Once these are in place, industrial farming will be more feasible, mining will be cheaper and investments are likely in other power plants. For better or for worse, the “end of the world” will never be quite the same again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/apr/20/guardian-view-britain-choice-2015-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-20T18:57:59Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Britain’s 2015 choice: energy policy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/20/guardian-view-britain-choice-2015-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/20/guardian-view-britain-choice-2015-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Britain’s 2015 choice: energy policy","bodyText":"This is the year of the Paris summit, the moment when the world must make tough decisions in order to start the process of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 2C. That deadline underlines the importance of collective action, and the damage that would be done if the next two years were all about an EU referendum. Britain cannot act effectively alone, but its capacity to influence debate depends on our commitment to taking tough decisions needed to green the economy. The strategic objective of the next British government’s energy policy must be to decarbonise energy production, reduce demand and develop green technology. Most of that was true in 2010 too: that is why David Cameron’s promise to lead the greenest government ever was so significant. Yet it was abandoned less than two years into the coalition. There were some solid achievements, but too much was lost as the Conservative climate-sceptic right, led for a time by the environment secretary Owen Paterson was allowed to undermine the more ambitious Liberal Democrat-led Department of Energy and Climate Change. The deal with EDF on the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point is the most significant single contribution to meeting the targets for a decarbonised energy supply and an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. There is a decent case for it. But it is telling that the coalition has had to rely so heavily on the one technology that is most compatible with “business as usual”. Beyond nuclear, there has been a lack of strategic thought. It took the intervention of Mr Cameron to get a deal on the fourth carbon budget, which led to the levy control framework that will raise a peak of £7.6bn from consumers and suppliers to invest in renewables by 2020. The chancellor, George Osborne, had become the leading nay-sayer after scoffing in 2011 that he would never “save the planet by putting Britain out of business”. Lib Dems take pride in the role of Britain in developing the EU’s demanding carbon reduction targets, but they lost out on ambitious plans for home insulation through the green deal that were compromised by an over-complicated structure, while the green investment bank never got the borrowing rights it needed to fulfil its promise. The Tories have cast off their green disguise. They will end subsidies for onshore wind power and rely on the market to bring down prices, they are enthusiastic about fracking and they want to build more roads. Labour is committed to decarbonising electricity supply by 2030, and Ed Miliband retains a personal interest in climate, but when it comes to campaigning the emphasis is more on cheaper than greener energy. The Lib Dems have a big, holistic vision for a decarbonised Britain by 2050, but they get fuzzy about the more immediate term. The Greens, of course, remain committed to creating a zero-carbon economy, even if that is at the cost of economic growth. That will alienate many cash-strapped voters, but their willingness to say the unsayable about the polluting way in which we run UK plc is one reason why, for all the party’s shortcomings, the Green voice deserves to be heard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/09/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-09T09:54:00Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Lego dumps Shell, beavers, and Naomi Klein on fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/09/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/09/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Lego dumps Shell, beavers, and Naomi Klein on fracking","bodyText":"Environment news • Lego ends Shell partnership following Greenpeace campaign • Glasgow becomes first university in Europe to divest from fossil fuels • EU approves Hinkley Point nuclear power station as costs raise by £8bn • Health watchdog contradicts claims Devon beavers pose human health risk • US east coast cities face frequent flooding due to climate change • EU scraps plan to label tar sands oil as highly polluting • Naomi Klein: UK fracking trespass law flouts democratic rights • UN biodiversity report highlights failure to meet conservation targets • Fish failing to adapt to rising carbon dioxide levels in ocean On the blogs • Nick Clegg taunts David Cameron on 'green crap' • GWPF funder Lord Leach is relying on unreliable sources of global warming information • Paraguay's Supreme Court issues 'historic' land ruling • Julia Roberts plays Mother Earth and Harrison Ford stars as the Ocean as Hollywood A-list 'speaks out for nature' • Scientists find human fingerprints all over Australia's hottest year on record Multimedia • Underwater classroom: professors to spend 73 days below sea surface – video • Oceana explores the water world of Canary Islands, Spain – in pictures • The week in wildlife – in pictures Features and comment • Are green bonds as good as they seem? | Lucy Siegle • In the Age of Extinction, which species can we least afford to lose? • Break up the Treasury to tackle our major environmental challenges • WWF International accused of 'selling its soul' to corporations • Are walrus at risk from climate change?

Opposition parties said Nicola Sturgeon’s government had to start dramatically cutting CO2 emissions from transport, housing and the public sector after the latest annual statistics showed Scotland missed its emissions target by 2m tonnes equivalent (mte) of CO2. Ministers at Holyrood said they planned to greatly increase investment in home energy efficiency by making it a national planning priority. But Richard Lochhead, the Scottish environment secretary, admitted that was a long-term plan which had yet to confirm its goals and funding. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-leader, said ministers had had six years to implement policies that would help achieve the legally set target of cutting Scotland’s emissions by 42% by 2020, frequently touted by Scottish National party leaders as the most ambitious in the world. Calling on ministers to nearly double their current £119m-a-year budget for home energy efficiency, increase central planning of bus services, and abandon plans to scrap aviation passenger duty, Harvie said the decision to make home energy efficiency a national planning priority was announced months ago. “They have failed spectacularly,” he said. “Since the Climate Act was passed in 2009 we have put nearly 10 million tonnes more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the targets allow – demonstrating a staggering lack of ambition by this government.” Sarah Boyack, Scottish Labour’s shadow environment minister, said in most areas directly controlled by the Scottish government, including transport, agriculture and housing, the falls in CO2 emissions were very low. Transport emissions overall have been cut very little since 1999, with cuts in overall emissions due to improved vehicle efficiency, not Scottish government policy. The latest data shows that, excluding North Sea oil and gas production emissions, Scotland released 53mte CO2 in 2013 against a Climate Act target of 48mte for 2013, compared to 55mte in 2012. Much of that year-on-year fall was attributable to a steep decline in CO2 emissions from electricity generation because of a fall in energy usage overall, a fall in coal-burning and a steep decline in gas-burning in power stations because of the surge in world gas prices that year. In parallel, renewable electricity production hit a record level of 32% in 2013, partly due to heavy Scottish government support. But the fall in fossil fuel use also meant the proportion of Scotland’s electricity needs met by nuclear power rose to 35% in 2013 – the highest proportion in a decade, despite the SNP’s firmly anti-nuclear stance. Bouyed by a new opinion poll showing the SNP had achieved a record level of 60% support among voters, Lochhead insisted that despite missing all four consecutive annual targets, the government would still meet its 2020 target and could do so early. Hitting the initial annual figures had been made harder than expected because the European commission revised its methods for assessing national CO2 emissions, after the 2009 act targets were set, he added. Under current rules, Scotland’s overall emissions have fallen by 34% since 1990. Using the old measures in force in 2009, they would have fallen by 38% in 2013. Even the adjusted figures gave Scotland one of the best figures within the EU and better than the total UK figure, Lochhead insisted. UK emissions have fallen 27% since 1990 but Scottish government data also shows that Scottish CO2 emissions per head in 2013 were 9.9 tonnes per person, higher than the 8.6t per head in England and the 9.3t per head for the UK as a whole. Lochhead said: “The statistics show we are making fantastic progress. We’re ahead of virtually every European country bar two. We’re way ahead of the rest of the UK and indeed, if anything, we will achieve our 42% reduction target by 2020 early. So Scotland is showing leadership. We’re getting results.” • The second paragraph of this article was corrected on 9 June 2015 because it confused a figure for Scottish emissions in 2013 which took account of EU emissions trading rules. That figure put 2013 emissions at 50m tonnes equivalent (mte) of CO2. The headline figures for 2013 excluding the emissions trading scheme put Scotland’s emissions at 53mte CO2, compared to 55mte CO2 in 2012."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jul/10/brexit-theresa-may-could-remain-subject-to-ecj-during-transitional-period-after-brexit-says-damian-green-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-10T16:29:49Z","webTitle":"Corbyn tells May she should read Labour manifesto if her government running out of ideas - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/10/brexit-theresa-may-could-remain-subject-to-ecj-during-transitional-period-after-brexit-says-damian-green-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/10/brexit-theresa-may-could-remain-subject-to-ecj-during-transitional-period-after-brexit-says-damian-green-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn tells May she should read Labour manifesto if her government running out of ideas - Politics live","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has mocked Theresa May’s appeal for cross-party cooperation on government policy making, telling her that if she is running out of ideas, she should read the Labour manifesto. (See 4.09pm.) May has signalled that her call for more cross-party cooperation does not extend to working with Corbyn on security matters. In the Commons, where May was making a statement on the G20, the Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne expressed doubts about May’s initiative, asking her: About this new love-fest with the benches opposite - given the record of [Corbyn] on the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, do you possess a very long spoon? May replied: Yes, I can say to you that I have in the past, as home secretary, welcomed the co-operation which I have had from the Labour benches - not from [Corbyn], but from others on his benches who have seen the need to ensure our agencies have appropriate powers to deal with the terrorist threat we face. I look forward to Labour MPs, and indeed others on the benches opposite in this House, coming forward and supporting those counter-terrorism measures when we bring them forward. Anne Marie Morris, a Conservative MP, has apologised after using the N-word at an event about Brexit. Opposition MPs have condemned her strongly, and May has been urged to withdraw the Conservative party whip from the backbencher. May has insisted that after Brexit the UK will maintain a close relationship with Euratom, the European civil nuclear regulator. Several Tory MPs have expressed concerns about the government’s plans to leave Euratom (see 12.09pm) and, when May was giving her Commons statement, several MPs asked her why the UK was withdrawing from it. In response to Hilary Benn May said: Membership of Euratom is inextricably linked with membership of the European Union. But what we are doing, as was signalled in the Queen’s Speech with reference to a future bill on this issue, is wanting to ensure that we can maintain those relationships, that cooperation with Euratom, which enables the exchange of scientists, the exchange of material. There are countries around the world that have that relationship with Euratom which are not members of the European Union but we need to put that bill in place and I look forward to your support for that bill. The government has rejected claims that leaving Euratom could reduce the supply of radioactive isotopes in the UK, which are used for cancer scans and treatment. The Evening Standard highlighted these concerns in its front-page splash. In response, a government spokeswoman said: This simply isn’t true. The availability of medical radioisotopes will not be impacted by the UK’s exit from Euratom. The UK supports Euratom and will want to see continuity of co-operation and standards. We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry. Around 1.4 million eastern Europeans are living in Britain, including 916,000 Polish people, and 80% of them are in work, according to the most complete official picture so far. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Labour’s Rachel Reeves asks why May is saying membership of Euratom is inextricably linked to EU membership when the UK was a member of Euratom before it joined the EEC. May says the treaty makes it clear the two are inextricably linked. Labour’s Diana Johnson asks for an assurance that the NHS will be excluded from a trade deal with the US. May says she understands the concerns about TTIP and the NHS. But TTIP would not have affected the NHS anyway, she says. Labour’s Kelvin Hopkins asks May for an assurance that any trade deal with the UK will not allow private companies to sue the government. May says she understands the concerns about TTIP (the proposed EU-US trade deal). She will get the best possible deal for the UK, she says. Labour’s Louise Ellman asks if the UK will retain membership of Europol and Eurojust after Brexit. May says she has defended membership of Europol in the past. She says she wants the UK to retain its cooperation with EU countries on criminal justice matters. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem former business secretary, asks if the UK will accept lower food standards and investor state dispute settlement mechanisms in its trade deal with the US. May says Cable is asking about a deal that has not yet been negotiated. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says there is a majority in the Commons to stay in Euratom and in the European Medicines Agency. So why won’t she stay in? May repeats the point about Euratom being inextricably linked to the EU. But the government wants to retain the benefits of Euratom membership, she says. That is why there was a bill for this in the Queen’s speech. The SNP’s Kirsty Blackman asks how much she expects immigration to increase as a result of trade deals with countries like India. May says the government can discuss trade deals now. She dodges the immigration question. The Labour MP Mary Creagh asks May if she will rule out intelligence sharing with the US, in the light of President Trump’s announcement of plans for a pact with Russia on cyber security. May says the government is serious about protecting its intelligence, and is aware of the threat from Russia. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, asks, in the light of the proposed “love-fest” with the opposition, and Jeremy Corbyn’s record on security, whether May has “a long spoon”. May says she has worked in the past on counter-terrorism legislation, not with Corbyn, but with other MPs from his party. Here is the key quote from Jeremy Corbyn, in his response to Theresa May. (See 3.47am.) I’m really surprised she had so much to contribute to the G20 given there was barely a mention of international policy in her party’s election manifesto. Or indeed any policy - so much so that the government is now asking other parties for their policy ideas. So, if the prime minister would like it, I would be very happy to furnish her with a copy of our election manifesto - or better still an early election, in order that the people of this country can better decide. Labour’s Hilary Benn says MPs are concerned about her plan to withdraw from the Euratom treaty. What does the UK gain from this? May says membership of Euratom is inextricably linked to EU membership. But the UK wants to retain the benefits of membership, she says. She says there are countries not in the EU that benefit from Euratom. That is what the government’s bill will do, she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, accuses May of “hypocrisy”. He says she talked about tackling terrorist funding, but the government is refusing to publish the Home Office report into the role Saudi Arabia is playing in funding extremism in the UK. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he must withdraw the charge. An MP cannot accuse another MP of hypocrisy in the chamber. Blackford does withdraw. May says the G20 focused not just on large scale terrorist funding, but small scale funding. That is clear in the communique, she says. She does not address the point about the Saudi Arabia report. Here is the latest on Anne Marie Morris, the Conservative MP who has used a racist figure of speech. (See 3.16pm.) May is now replying to Corbyn. She says Britain has a proud record on climate change. She says she welcomes the high court decision on the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. The government has an ambitious agenda for the country, she says. She says there are many issues on which she hopes they can reach consensus, like giving the police the powers they need, protecting workers’ rights and protecting female candidates from bullying and harassment at elections. She says Jeremy Corbyn should condemn abuse of this kind. (He has. See 2.09pm.) Corbyn is still speaking. He says the high court may have ruled that the government is acting legally with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. But it is not acting ethically, he says. He criticises May for not raising climate change with President Trump in her bilateral with him. But apparently she raised it in an informal meeting later, he says. He says May should clarify what that means. He criticises May for ignoring her obligations to the planet. He asks if May will offer EU nationals in the UK the same right they had now. He asks if she discussed Euratom. On terrorism, he asks why the government has released the report on Saudi funding for extremism. He says May is threatening to turn the UK into a low-wage, deregulated tax haven. He asks when a trade deal with the US will happen. And what will it say about workers’ rights and environmental protections? Jeremy Corbyn is responding now. He says he is surprised that May had so much to contribute, given that there was so little on international policy in the Conservative manifesto. And the government does not have many ideas on anything, he says, since it is now asking other parties for ideas. He says he would be happy to give May a copy of Labour’s manifesto. Better still, May should call an election, he says. Corbyn says May should read the Labour manifesto if her government is short of ideas. Theresa May is making her statement now. She says at the G20 she showed how the UK is making a contribution and setting the agenda on a range of international issues. She says she pushed in particular for measures to tackle extremism online. She says she pushed for reform in international trade rules, particularly so that that can deal with digital trade. In some areas trade rules are not operation properly, she says. She says the dumping of steel is an example. She says she discussed free trade deal with other G20 leaders, including leaders from America, Japan, China and India. She says she and her G20 counterparts were “dismayed” by President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement. She says she hopes America will rejoin. She says the G20 cannot and must not ignore the problem of modern slavery. She put it on the agenda for her first G20 summit a year ago, and she says at this summit she urged the G20 to follow the lead set by the UK in the Modern Slavery Act. Theresa May is about to make a Commons statement on the G20 summit. George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor and former Conservative chancellor, has published an editorial accusing Theresa May of over-ruling David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and other cabinet ministers over the rights of EU nationals and Euratom. Here’s the key extract. To get the negotiations off to a good start, [Davis] wanted to make a unilateral offer to European citizens living here that they could remain. Mrs May repeatedly overruled him. Mr Davis was open to Britain remaining party to the Euratom Treaty — the arrangements between European nations, including those outside the EU, that govern the transit and security of radioactive materials across the continent. As this paper reports exclusively today, the Royal College of Radiologists fears withdrawing from Euratom would endanger the import of the radioisotopes from Europe used in cancer scans and the treatment of 10,000 patients here. It was Mrs May who overruled Mr Davis and others in the Cabinet, such as Greg Clarke, to insist that we sacrifice those sensible international arrangements on the altar of the dogmatic purity of Brexit. That rigid approach now faces humiliating defeat in Parliament, as a growing number of Conservative MPs make clear they will rebel. The editorial says, if there was a leadership election now, Davis would be a “shoo-in” to replace May. It says he must decide now whether or not to challenge her. The editorial implies he should ... UPDATE: Here is the Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman on the editorial. The Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris has been criticised for using racist figure of speech, HuffPost reports. Here are the main points from the Theresa May press conference with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister. May claimed that her record as home secretary showed that she believed in working with other parties to develop policy. Asked about her call for more cross-party cooperation (see 9.21am), she replied: The government has got an ambitious agenda. It’s an ambitious agenda which is there to address the big challenges that the country faces. Of course one of those is getting the Brexit negotiations right. But there are other challenges that we face as a country too. And I think the country will rightly want us to get the broadest possible consensus in looking at those issues. And this is something I’ve done before. I did it as home secretary on counter-terrorism measures, like the Investigatory Powers Act, working with other political parties to ensure that we got that legislation right. I did it on the Modern Slavery Act, working with other parties to ensure that that went on to the statute book. This is certainly not the way many people remember her time as home secretary. The Investigatory Powers Act started life as the draft communications data bill (aka, the “snoopers’ charter”), but it was effectively shelved for three years because May could not reach agreement on it with the Lib Dems. And May was the only cabinet minister in the coalition who had a minister resign because she was too non-consensual. When the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker quit as a Home Office minister, he said he was going because he could no longer tolerate May’s non-consensual approach. He said: They have looked upon it as a Conservative department in a Conservative government, whereas in my view it’s a coalition department in a coalition government. That mindset has framed things, which means I have had to work very much harder to get things done even where they are what the home secretary agrees with and where it has been helpful for the government and the department. There comes a point when you don’t want to carry on walking through mud and you want to release yourself from that. She claimed the government had “an ambitious agenda”. (See quote above.) This, too, is highly contestable. Much of the commentary on the Queen’s speech (this, for example) focused on how thin it was. Last week the business in the House of Commons was so light that MPs got through the whole week without a single division. Two bills got a second reading - the air travel organisers’ licensing bill and the European Union (approvals) bill, which relates to EU agreements regarding Albania, Serbia and Canada - but they were so uncontentious that no MP voted against. Tonight the main business is the telecommunications infrastructure (relief from non-domestic rates) bill. May said she wanted to achieve “the broadest possible consensus” on Brexit. She cited legislating to protect candidates from harassment and abuse as an example of an issue on which the parties could work together. Praising Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, for her stance on this, May said: I think we should be working together to find a way to ensure that that sort of behaviour, which was of course targeted not just at candidates but at others during the election - make sure that the message goes out very clearly that that has no role in our democracy. She sidestepped a question about whether she favoured lifting the public sector pay cap. Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, said Australia wanted to conclude a free trade deal with the UK “as soon as possible” after Brexit. Asked how quickly it might be agreed, Turnbull replied: As soon as possible. We move quickly. Australians are fleet of foot. We don’t muck around. We’re very simple. So we will move as quickly as the UK will move and we will move as soon as Britain is lawfully able to enter into a free trade agreement. But Turnbull also stressed that Australia wanted a free trade deal with the EU too. Q: Have you any thoughts on the risk of the Ashes series not happening this year because of the Australian players’ strike? May says England always welcomes the chance to play Australia at cricket and “show them a thing or two”. Turnbull says Australians want to see their players on the field beating the Poms. And that’s it. The press conference is over. The Mirror’s Jason Beattie says the Mail question (see 2.05pm) is based on a false premise. Q: [From the Daily Mail] The great repeal bill is being introduced this week. Would you compromise with Labour over Brexit? And are you worried that Jeremy Corbyn has failed to condemn the actions of some of his supporters? May says she wants the broadest possible consensus for Brexit. She says she would like all party leaders to condemn the bullying and harassment of MPs. She would be surprised if any leaders does not do so. Q: The UK and Australia worked together to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. But Iraq did not have WMD. Now North Korea does pose a WMD threat. Are you willing to tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea? No, both Turnbull and May say. May says the UK does not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. But the Chinese are the ones with most leverage over North Korea. Q: [From Laura Kuenssberg] You want to work with other parties. But what do you to those who say you need to change. And will you raise pay for workers like teachers? May says the government has got an ambitious agenda. It wants to address the challenges facing the country. The public wants the government to get consensus, she says. She says she did this as home secretary, on issues like counter-terrorism and modern slavery. And commissioning Matthew Taylor to review the gig economy is another good example, she says. Another issue is the abuse directed at candidates during the election. That is an example where the parties can work together. Q: How soon do you think you could conclude a trade deal with the UK? As quickly as possible, says Turnbull. He says Australians are very fleet of foot. They want to do it as soon as legally possible. Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, says the last time he debated Theresa May was at the Oxford Union, when they were both students at the university. May was Theresa Brazier then, he says. He says Philip May, May’s husband, was then president of the union. He says the Australian people saw the recent terror attacks on Britain as an attack on their values too. He says he and May visited the scene where the police confronted the Borough Market attackers. He praises them for the speed with which they dealt with the terrorists. He says the relationship between the UK and Australia is built on trust. No two countries are closer, he says. They trust each other because they are family, he says. He says he agrees with Theresa May about ensuring the rule of law prevails online as well as offline. They cannot allow the internet to provide safe spaces for terrorists, he says. He says they talked about North Korea. He and May want North Korea to stop its reckless conduct. And they want China to do more to bring North Korea “to its senses”. He says Australia looks forward to “speedily” concluding a free trade deal with the UK once Brexit is over. It is looking forward to a concluding a free trade deal with the EU too. He says he believes in open markets. They are one reason why Australia has had 26 years of uninterrupted growth. He thanks May for inviting the Australian chef, Skye Gyngell, to cook lunch. He says Gyngell’s father, Bruce, was a friend and mentor to him. Theresa May is speaking at the press conference now. She starts by talking about her visit to Borough Market with Malcolm Turnbull this morning, and thanks Australians for the solidarity they showed after the attack. She says Australia and the UK want to deepen cooperation on defence and security. She says Brexit negotiations have started well. And a comprehensive free trade deal with Australia is a priority, she says. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, plans to visit Australia in the coming months for further talks on this issue, she says. Here is video of Theresa May and Malcolm Turnbull visiting Borough Market earlier. They were there because two Australians were killed in the recent terror attack. Theresa May is about to hold a press conference with Malcolm Turnbull, her Australian counterpart. There is a live feed here. The application for an urgent question on Euratom has been turned down, Labour whips reveal. The EU is expected to give its first official response to Britain’s proposals for EU citizens this week, following a “cabinet meeting” of all departments in the European Commission executive branch of the EU. Elmar Brok, the German MEP, told Adam Boulton on Sky News on Monday that he believed that the EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier would support Guy Verhofstadt’s analysis that the proposal is “a damp squib”. He said he had heard that “Mr Barnier is also quite unhappy with the proposal from Britain as it stands at the moment”. Brok was one of the signatories on the open letter written by Verhofstadt and published in several papers around Europe. He said he expected that the outcome of negotiations would be the UK reciprocating the EU proposal to guarantee all the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in Europe. He said: We believe we should keep reciprocity. We are working for the rights of citizens, this is quite important; we are ready to give British citizens the full rights as they have at the moment, that is the EU proposal at the moment and we wait British to give EU citizens the same treatment. One of the major issues was enforcement, he said, echoing fears that unless there was oversight from the European court of justice or some other supra-national body, the UK would be free to undo whatever offer it made once it exited the EU. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street confirmed that the UK could continue to pay money into the EU budget during a transitional period after Brexit. The prime minister’s spokesman said this after confirming that Damian Green was setting out government policy when he said the UK could remain subject to the European court of justice during a transitional period. (See 9.01am.) The spokesman said that the prospect of paying money into the EU budget during a transitional period was something that would be “subject to negotiation”. But he added: “Once we leave [the EU], the days of paying large sums [to the EU] are over.” Green will stand in for May at PMQs on Wednesday, the spokesman said. (See 11.39am.) May will make a statement to the Commons at 3.30pm about the G20 summit. May and Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, have been visiting Borough Market in London this morning. Two Australians were killed in the attack. Later May and Turnbull are having talks in Downing Street, and they will hold a press conference at 1.30pm. The prime minister’s spokesman cited counter-terrorism, workers’ rights and industrial strategy as three policy areas where the government would be open to working in cooperation with the opposition. Asked for more details as to what May has in mind when she calls for more cross-party cooperation (see 9.21am), the spokesman said journalists should wait until she delivers her speech on this tomorrow. The department for education will publish the latest recommendations from the pay review body for teachers, and the government’s response, this afternoon in a written ministerial statement. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, will make a statement to the Commons at about 5pm about the high court judgment defending the government’s policy on arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director (who tweets as odysseanproject), has said that those in government who favour leaving Euratom are “morons”. Labour are trying to get an urgent question on Euratom, the Financial Times’ Jim Pickard reports. At the weekend the Conservative MP Ed Vaizey and the Labour MP Rachel Reeves published a joint article in the Telegraph (paywall) criticising the government’s plans to leave Euratom, the European atomic energy community, at the same time as Brexit. Here is an extract. The scientific community is rightly concerned, fearing a ‘brain drain’ of talented scientists from the UK to the EU after our exit. Those working in cancer medicine who understand what this might mean for the treatment of the most vulnerable patients are seeking urgent assurances from the Government. And the exit from Euratom is casting uncertainty over the UK’s plans for nuclear power, not least at Hinkley Point. We believe there is an opportunity for a rethink. Both our parties are absolutely committed to implementing the result of the referendum on EU membership, even though we both campaigned to remain. But this is not about EU membership. Our cooperation on nuclear issues predates the EU. Whatever people were voting for last June, it certainly wasn’t to junk 60 years of cooperation in this area with our friends and allies. Significantly, as Sky’s Faisal Islam reports, at least eight Tory MPs now seem to back this argument. If they were to vote with all opposition parties in favour of staying in Euratom, that would be enough to defeat the government. (If the DUP vote with the Conservatives, the government has a working majority of 13.) The Evening Standard, which is edited by the Conservative former chancellor George Osborne, is splashing on a new take on the issue. I’m back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. It was relatively short and unilluminating, and the main news was that Damian Green, the first secretary of state, will be standing in for Theresa May at PMQs on Wednesday because she will be attending the ceremonial arrival of the King of Spain for his state visit. The prime minister’s spokesman said there was a precedent for a prime minister missing PMQs while attending a ceremonial occasion in London; Gordon Brown did the same in March 2010, he said. I will post a fuller summary in a moment. After the Westminster Bridge terror attack Theresa May said she wanted to stop terrorists being able to keep their communications secret. May and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, suggested they wanted internet firms to create means of allowing the security services to access messages sent using end-to-end encryption in certain circumstances. This morning the Today programme interviewed Robert Hannigan, who was head of GCHQ until earlier this year. Hannigan said the government should not be trying to undermine end-to-end encryption. I can’t see, particularly as many of these companies are US-based, that legislation is the answer on this. I don’t think there is a magic solution where you can just legislate it away ... Everyone would like a simple answer on encryption and unfortunately it is very difficult. Encryption is an overwhelmingly good thing - it keeps us all safe and secure. Throughout the Cold War, until about 15 years ago, it was something which only governments could do at scale. What’s happened is that you can now get the same grade of encryption on a number of apps on your smartphone. It’s available to everybody. That is a good thing. The challenge for governments is how do you stop the abuse of that encryption by a tiny minority of people who want to do bad things, like terrorists or criminals. I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I’ll post again after 11.30am. Parliament hasn’t burned down. They’ve let us back in ... A fire alarm has just gone off, and we’re being told to leave the press gallery. Hopefully I’ll be back soon, but you never know .... Here is a full summary of the key points from Damian Green’s interviews this morning. Green, the first secretary of state, said Britain could remain subject to European court of justice rulings during a transitional period after Brexit. (See 9.01am.) He said appealing to other parties to work with the government on policy was just “a grown-up way of doing politics”. We’re saying that politicians of all parties, it’s not just addressed to Jeremy Corbyn, but that there are big issues facing this country, obviously Brexit is the overwhelming one, but there’s counter-terrorism, there’s workers’ rights - the thing that’s very much in the news today with the Matthew Taylor report - issues like the industrial strategy. And politicians of all parties are invited to contribute their ideas and that’s a grown-up way of doing politics. I think a lot of your listeners would think actually if politicians just said why don’t we do this about a particular national issue rather than just sit in the trenches and shell each other, then we might actually have better government and that’s what the prime minister is talking about tomorrow. But in his Today interview Green said little to suggest that that Theresa May’s appeal for cross-party cooperation (see 9.21am) will make much difference. It was put to him that there was a majority in the Commons for increasing public sector pay, or reducing tuition fees, or adopting a more jobs-first approach to Brexit, but on all three issues he played down the prospect of working with the opposition to develop new policy. Green said the government would not reintroduce plans to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, proposed this in his spring budget. The plan would have raised £2bn over four years, but he dropped it after complaints that it broke the Tory 2015 manifesto promise not to increase NICs. Asked if the government would try to introduce the NICs increase again, he said: We won’t be revisiting that... the House of Commons has already spoken on that so we won’t be revisiting that. He said there was “no credible plot” against Theresa May in existence. Asked about stories in the Sunday papers about Tory MPs plotting to oust her, he replied: I’m saying that there is no credible plot going on. There is nothing like that going on. The prime minister is determined to carry on to lead the party and the country for many years to come and the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs are behind her in that. He dismissed complaints from MEPs that EU nationals living in the UK would have their rights reduced under the government’s plans for them post Brexit. In a joint article, the leaders of groups representing three quarters of MEPs have strongly criticised the government’s post-Brexit offer to EU nationals living in the UK. Asked what he would say to them, Green replied: I would say ... ‘Read our proposal’. Our proposal is precisely that - that somebody who is here now will keep the rights that they already have and we hope and expect that British citizens living in other EU countries will keep the rights that they already have now. He dismissed the prospect of May deciding to quit of her own accord over the summer. She would carry on, he insisted. She thinks not just that it’s her duty but that she has a programme for Britain that encompasses not just a good Brexit deal but also a domestic agenda that will spread prosperity around this country, make this a fairer society, tackle some of the injustices that we still have in our society, and that fire burns within her as strongly as ever. Theresa May will deliver the speech saying that she would like to work with opposition parties on proposals to improve Britain at an event tomorrow to launch the Matthew Taylor report on the gig economy. But the key extract featuring the appeal for cross-party cooperation was released last night. Here it is in full. When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as prime minister is rather different. In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in parliament as well as in the country. So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons … come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country. We may not agree on everything, but through debate and discussion – the hallmarks of our Parliamentary democracy – ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found. It is in that spirit that we will take this agenda forward in the months ahead. And this new context presents us as a government with a wider choice. At this critical time in our history, we can either be timid or we can be bold. We can play it safe or we can strike out with renewed courage and vigour, making the case for our ideas and values and challenging our opponents to contribute, not just criticise. I think this country needs a government that is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for Britain and we are determined to be that government. In everything we do, we will act with an unshakeable sense of purpose to build the better, fairer Britain which we all want to see. Damian Green, the first secretary of state (effectively the deputy prime minister), has been touring the studios this morning giving interviews about Theresa May’s unusual invitation to the opposition parties to help cobble together some government policies. I will post a full summary of what he has been saying soon. But there was an interesting concession on Brexit. Green, who is one of the most pro-European figures in the cabinet, was asked about the European court of justice continuing to have a say over British affairs after the UK leaves the EU. He defended Theresa May’s decision to make freeing the UK from the grip of the ECJ in the long term a red line. He told the Today programme. It’s not an ideological determination. It is what people voted for in the referendum ... If we said now ‘Well, we’re going to stay inside the single market, which will mean that the European court will decide some basic questions that happen inside this country’, I think people would feel that we hadn’t left the European Union. But, when he was asked if the government would be willing to remain subject to ECJ rulings during the transitional period - the period between Britain leaving at the end of March 2019 and rules creating a new relationship with the EU coming fully into effect - he effectively said yes. He said: If there needs to be some kind of implementation period, or transition period, in certain areas after March 2019, which I think everyone agrees is quite likely, then the rules that operate during that transition period will by definition not be the rules that we have afterwards. When Nick Robinson asked him to confirm that this meant being subject to ECJ rulings during this period, Green went on: But that is a transition period. That will last for a limited amount of time, for practical reasons, to make sure that business can have the certainty to carry on as we want it to. It has always been probable that a transitional period would involve Britain continuing to be subject to ECJ judgments. But in the past ministers have tried to avoid being explicit about this because it is not clear whether hardline leave supporters would find this acceptable. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives a speech on industrial strategy to the Resolution Foundation. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes a report on migration between Britain and the Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 1.30pm: Theresa May holds a press conference with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. 2.30pm: Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Parliamentary democracy, a free media, the English language, tea with milk: however ruthless and greedy British imperialism may have been, its 250-year history in India left that country with several of the imperfect institutions, beliefs and habits that Britain finds familiar and admirable. But where is the money in all this – the investment in the nuclear power plants and high-speed railways that Britain allegedly needs? The brute truth is that China has piles of cash looking for a return abroad and India doesn’t. It will overtake China in the next 10 years to become the world’s most populous country, and yet it’s still only the world’s seventh-largest economy. Its gross domestic product lies between those of France and Italy in a league table that has the UK in fifth place with a GDP a quarter of China’s. Of course, these positions aren’t fixed. This year India overtook China in its growth rate, and it may well replace Japan as the world’s third-richest country during the next 10 to 15 years. In the long term, then, Hilton may be right about India as the greater opportunity. The pertinent question is whether the long Indo-British encounter gives Britain any special advantage over other nations in exploiting it. If history was arithmetical and just – if it amounted to a cycle of loss and reparation – then Britain should, if anything, be disadvantaged. In a speech 10 years ago, India’s then prime minister, Manmohan Singh, quoted the work of the English economic historian, Angus Maddison, to show how India’s share of world income collapsed from 22.6% in 1700, which was almost equal to the whole of Europe’s share at that time, to as low as 3.8% in 1952. “There is no doubt that our grievances against the British Empire had a sound basis,” Singh said, adding that the so-called “brightest jewel in the British crown” was by 1900 the poorest country in the world in terms of per capita income. “However,” he continued, “what is significant about the Indo-British relationship is the fact that despite the economic impact of colonial rule, the relationship between individual Indians and Britons, even at the time of our Independence, was relaxed and, I may even say, benign.” It needs to be said that he was speaking after the award of an honorary degree from Oxford University, where he’d been a postgraduate student in economics 40 years before. Nonetheless, his remarks can’t be disparaged as the sentimentality of a privileged elite. Few British visitors to India in the past 70 years can ever have complained about a want of hospitality or friendship. In fact, this human dimension became such a large part of the postcolonial British response to the place that the foundations of the relationship, which lay in conquest and trade, were obscured by a cloud of fond feeling that was part EM Forster, part Ravi Shankar and (for a few) part bhang. Independence hadn’t meant that Britain and India had stopped selling things to each other. In the middle 1960s, the UK was still India’s largest trading partner after the US, whose wheat exports alleviated critical Indian shortages. The Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan were rising in importance, but when I first went to India, in 1976, Britain was by far the most obvious foreign influence. Cars, chocolate, newspapers, railways, biscuits, books, cigarette brands, the voices that read the radio news: all bore the hallmark of the old colonial power. And yet the British people I encountered in the years that followed rarely talked about trade. It didn’t interest them. There were exceptions: in an Indian coal town I met a Yorkshire mining engineer, and in Kolkata the knighted chairman of a tea company who had sherry with his soup. These were remnants rather than forerunners: like the names of the big managing agencies – Mackinnon Mackenzie, Shaw Wallace, Andrew Yule – they survived as evidence that Britain had once had a considerable commercial presence in the cities then called Calcutta and Bombay. It was easy to meet Indian executives who until recently had to wear cummerbunds to ICI dinners – the company rule – and marvel at the beautiful models of British liners that shipping offices kept in glass cases, but the tide had gone out. Selling goods to India can’t have been easy in an era of protectionism when poorly run industries sheltered behind high tariff barriers, and the country’s low growth rate put a brake on demand. Perhaps, too, there was a failure of will on the British side, prompted by the feeling that a long historical process was ending: a commercial exhaustion. In Britain, interest in India had never been higher than it was in the 1980s – the Raj Quartet on TV, Attenborough’s Gandhi at the cinema, Salman Rushdie on the bookshelves – but it rarely translated into the urge to trade. And, of course, there was also the question of what a deindustrialising Britain had to sell that India might want or (in the case of arms) could be persuaded to buy. When economic liberalisation happened in the 1990s, India went elsewhere for its technology. Britain, it seemed, had missed its chance. Prime ministers went out to drum up business, but by then everybody wanted to be India’s friend. Today the UK no longer makes the list of India’s top 15 trading partners; neither does India appear in such a British list. China matters far, far more to both countries than they do to each other. In any case, Hilton’s wish is already obliged. The red carpet will be rolled out when India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, pays his first visit to Britain next month. He won’t enjoy treatment quite as plush as Xi Jinping: Modi isn’t a head of state, so no palace banquet and no ride in a coach up the Mall. But 70,000 people will crowd into Wembley stadium for a rally in his honour, which may be more than compensation. Similar love-ins, organised and attended by the Indian diaspora, have been a feature of his visits to Australia and the US, but Wembley promises to be the bigger and better, closing with what the organisers say will be “the largest fireworks display ever held in the UK”. Modi has bitter critics as well as avid supporters. His role in the Gujarat riots of 2002 has never been established to general satisfaction, and reports suggest communal tensions in India are growing under his rule. Nearly 40 Westminster MPs have signed a motion calling on Cameron to raise human rights concerns with Modi during his visit. They include Alex Salmond and Jeremy Corbyn. So, Xi or Narendra? We must try to imagine an Indian peasant being confronted with a similar question in 1700, when India had a quarter of the world’s income. Colonial armies are gathering over the horizon. Who would you rather rule you, Britain or France?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/dec/13/ten-things-japanese-people-are-worrying-about-ahead-of-the-snap-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-13T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Ten things Japanese people are worrying about before the snap election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/dec/13/ten-things-japanese-people-are-worrying-about-ahead-of-the-snap-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/dec/13/ten-things-japanese-people-are-worrying-about-ahead-of-the-snap-election","fields":{"headline":"Ten things Japanese people are worrying about before the snap election","bodyText":"This Sunday sees a snap election in Japan, as Shinzo Abe attempts to shore up a mandate for his Liberal Democratic party’s economic reforms. We asked our readers to tell us the mood in Japan ahead of the election. The responses we received suggest concern for Japan’s economic and social direction, alongside apathy and frustration at the political process. Here are ten key themes that emerged. 1) Voter apathy Voter turnout dropped to a postwar low in 2012, and is expected to be even lower for Sunday’s poll. Our readers were particularly worried about apathy among young voters. Hana Kobayashi, a student in her twenties, said: “Young people still tend not to go and cast votes. They believe they don’t have power to change society therefore it is waste of time.” “People who are born after the bubble economy of the 1980s haven’t experienced a period of prosperity and growth, so they don’t trust the government or politicians, said Tomofumi Nagahara. “But it is very dangerous. The younger generation is a minority in Japan now. A quarter of people are over 65. Politicians cannot suggest policies that are future-oriented. I think Japan is standing on the edge, so the younger generation should take action. The first step is to go and vote.” “Elderly people tend to like Abe’s ideas,” said Hiroshi Kaneko. “Younger people are not very interested in voting.” 2) Abenomics According to prime minister Abe, the election is little more than a referendum on Abenomics, the premier’s flagship economic policies of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. But with Japan back in recession, and April’s rise in the national sales tax impacting on fragile consumer confidence, our readers were united in worry for the nation’s economic prospects. “If [the lack of spending caused by tax rises] continues, the market is going to go through a deflation cycle and eventually will collapse,” said Yuki Okada. “There are voices that express how Japan is more stable with Abe, but at the same time, there is a possible chance of the Japan’s economy collapsing.” “Many people in Japan are fed up with neoliberal economic policy, said Yoshiko Matsuda. “One little hope is many candidates from LDP are not happy with Abe administration’s economic policy, and would hold up the structural reform Abe is aiming at.” “Mr. Abe had to postpone raising consumption tax to 10% because he was afraid this would create an economic crisis in Japan,” says Mika Oohara. “There is the additional problem about the devaluation of the Yen because this makes imported products more expensive and this makes daily groceries go up. In turn, this puts a burden on people’s budgets and consumption decreases.” 3) Limited political choice The main opposition, the comparatively left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), is yet to recover from its troubled three years in office, which ended in December 2012. Abe’s snap election is seen as a means to take advantage of such a weak opposition despite the country’s economic troubles, but our readers described their frustration at the lack of a coherent alternative. “The LDP is not politically diverse anymore,” says Kosuke Moriwaki. It used to have both conservatives and liberals within it, but liberals in the party are powerless and almost dying out” “Do we have any parties to choose?” asked Sayuri Hirao. “I am one of the voter who don’t know which I should vote for.” “The DPJ’s failure in the past government still remains deep in our minds,” said Akira Inatsugu. “If there was another party that was conservative in economic and diplomatic terms like Abe, but more to the left in social and cultural issues. I’d vote for them,” says Kota Ishii. “But no such party [exists].” 4) Nuclear power Abe hopes to restart operations at two nuclear power plants early next year, a very controversial move in a country still demanding answers over the Fukushima disaster. Japan’s lack of natural resources, and increasing reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports, mean the government feels it has no choice, despite the majority opposing nuclear power. “Abe said Fukushiima is under control, but the situation gets worse and worse,” says Ayaka Kimura. “Nonetheless, the LDP decided to restart nuclear power plants all over Japan. This is not democracy.” 5) The secrecy law The Specially Designated Secrets Act came into force earlier this week, a matter of days before the election. Under the new law, citizens - including, potentially, whistleblowers and journalists - can be jailed for up to 10 years for revealing state secrets. Critics say the law is ripe for misuse, and could be used to curtail press freedom. Reporters Without Borders called the new law “an unprecedented threat to freedom of information”. “The notorious secrecy law is starting today. I’m afraid freedom of expression is being obstructed,” said one pseudonymous reader. 6) The role of the media Beyond the specifics of the secrecy law, many respondents mentioned their frustration with Japan’s mass media, particularly its television networks, which were said by many to be too soft on - or, worse, too close to - the government. “The main factor preventing TV stations from having more freedom is a business licence issued by the government, argued Mr Samuka, from Hokkaido. “Unlike the BBC, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) has an unique structure that the government can easily put political pressure on. “Just before the election, LDP distributed a request to various publications for “neutral reporting”. While many people suspect the content of this request violates editorial rights, most of the mass media did not show any objection.” “NHK talks about the students in Hong Kong every day, but doesn’t care a bit about Japanese students,” said Nobuko Hamamoto. “Sure, there are fewer than in Hong Kong, but still more than 2000 protested against the operation of the Secret Infomation Protection Act.” 7) The pacifist constitution “The Abe administration introduced the right of collective self-defense that ignores the constitution,” said Daisuke Shirado, referring to plans to introduce legislation to re-interpret Japan’s unique pacifist constitution, to allow Japan’s Defence Force to fight overseas if an ally - realistically, the US - were to come under attack. “The right of Collective Defense violates our Constitution,” says Ayaka Kimura. “Prime minister Abe says we need the right for our peace, [but] many Japanese people know our peace has been kept by not attacking any countries. “If politicians can violate the constitution, why does it exist?” 8) Okinawa There are ongoing tensions over the future of the United States’ military bases on Okinawa, particularly over the controversial move of a marine base to an off-shore site. “Fierce electoral campaigns for seats in the parliament are taking places all over Okinawa,” says “Those who support ruling party says that economy is the only issue of the election, says Michiharu Honda. “Those who oppose emphasise U.S. Military bases in Okinawa. “Okinawa only consist 0.6% of land in Japan, but Okinawa has 74% U.S. bases in Japan. Unemployment rate is the highest in Japan. The divorce rate is high, and there are so many single mothers. I think both economy and US base are the issue here.” 9) Equal rights Abe’s vow to increase the number of women represented in public and corporate life seems to have fallen by the wayside in the lead up to the election, a point that did not go unnoticed by our readers. “The media don’t pay enough attention to Abe’s human rights policy, said Kazuyoshi Kawasaka. “At the same time, LDP is the only party in Japan which claims sexual minorities’ rights are not part of human rights.” Same-sex unions are still not recognised by Japanese law. “There is still strong sexism rooted deep in our culture even though we have equal rights for both sexes,” says another reader. “Illegal working styles have become nothing out of the ordinary as companies don’t follow the labour law.” 10) The rise of nationalism Abe’s time in power has been marked by an increased belligerence in foreign policy and a revisionist approach to Japan’s wartime past. Our readers who responded were, on the whole, deeply concerned about the direction of travel of the past few years. “Japan is treading a conservative, militarist path,” said Hana Kobayash. “They are calling attention to the economic situation, but in fact this is a birth of a government that oppress the people,” said Satoshi Murata. “We have a government in power who is bent on turning back the clock,” said Kazue Nakamura-Hube. “They are really dreaming of becoming the military/industrial country.” “I have to be optimistic, because young generations are very concerned about the future we are going to have with the leadership of the current Abe regime. “We are determined not to go back in our history and make the same mistakes.” Translation work by Yuki Shirota"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/14/iran-slows-nuclear-programme-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-14T19:28:02Z","webTitle":"Iran slows expansion of nuclear programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/14/iran-slows-nuclear-programme-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/14/iran-slows-nuclear-programme-iaea","fields":{"headline":"Iran slows expansion of nuclear programme","bodyText":"Iran's new government has significantly slowed down expansion of its nuclear programme in an apparent attempt to give more time for negotiations. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency says over the past three months Iran has installed no new major parts in its heavy water reactor in Arak, whose construction is one of the major remaining sticking points in multilateral talks which adjourned in Geneva early on Sunday. The Iranian stockpile of medium-enriched uranium crept up by about 10kg to 196kg. The stockpile, enriched to 20% purity, is an another leading proliferation concern, but it remains well below the estimated 250kg that would be required, with further enrichment, to make a nuclear weapon. Just as significantly, Iran has virtually stopped the growth of its enrichment capacity. It installed no new-model centrifuges at its enrichment plant in Natanz over the past quarter, which is important as the new centrifuges, the IR-2M, can enrich uranium up to five times faster than the old model, the IR-1 Only four more IR-1 centrifuges have been added bringing the total to 15,240. None of the IR-2M are being fed with uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich, and overall the number of centrifuges being used for enrichment has stayed roughly the same since the beginning of the last year. The slowdown in the growth of the Iranian programme comes amid the most intensive diplomacy over Iran's nuclear programme for a decade. Foreign ministers from Iran and six major powers – the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – came close last week to a stopgap deal that would have rolled back elements of the programme and lifted some sanctions. The talks stalled because of insistence, led by France, that any deal should not grant Iran the long-term right to enrich uranium and should halt work on the Arak reactor. The IAEA inspectors found that although the reactor vessel had been connected up to piping, \"no other major components, such as the control room equipment, the refuelling machine and reactor cooling pumps, had been installed.\" Most experts think the reactor is very unlikely to be completed on schedule by early next year. The talks are due to resume next week in Geneva. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has lobbied hard against an interim deal with Iran, said last night he was not impressed by the slowdown in the Iranian programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2015/may/15/what-most-radioactive-city-chernobyl-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"What's the most radioactive city?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/15/what-most-radioactive-city-chernobyl-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2015/may/15/what-most-radioactive-city-chernobyl-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"What's the most radioactive city?","bodyText":"A difficult decision faced Futaba, Japan this January. The vacant town, located within the Prohibited Zone created after the Fukushima nuclear leak in 2011 (which continues to spill toxic effluent into the Pacific Ocean), was asked to host a radioactive materials storage facility, for the bags of radioactive topsoil and debris that have been sitting in fields around the area for years. The exiled municipal authorities agreed – perhaps sealing the fate of the city even should it be cleared one day for repopulation. Despite the promise that the stuff will be taken away within 30 years, temporary has a way of blending into permanence. Meanwhile, 120,000 residents of Fukushima Prefecture remain evacuated – a reminder that while ionised radiation is a fact of life for us all, for residents of some cities it’s a daily source of worry. It’s not always easy to know how radioactive your city is, though – or at least how dangerous the radiation makes it. The amount of radioactive material in the environment is not the only factor: many of the bioactive effects don’t stem from direct radiation but rather from that radioactive material’s access to your body, in the air you breathe or the plants you eat. Aberdeen in Scotland, for example, is founded on radium-rich rock, and is often called a “radioactive city”. But without fissures in that rock for radon to escape, the dangerous gas remains trapped and harmless. Were the city located just a few kilometres further north, where cracks in the bedrock are abundant, it would be a different story: significant work might need to go into ground-floor ventilation. Radon gas is the second-biggest contributor to lung cancer, and its effects are enhanced by the leading cause, smoking. On the coast of the Caspian Sea, the city of Ramsar, Iran has such high natural background radiation levels that scientists have recommended that the 32,000 residents relocate. Its neighbourhood of Talesh Mahalleh, the most naturally radioactive inhabited area in the world, is under long-term study. The houses in Ramsar are partly to blame. Uranium-rich igneous rock is dissolved by groundwater that emerges to the surface in nine hot springs (which are used for bathing). There, the radium enters into the limestone from which most of the local houses are built. It also infuses the drinking water and accumulates in the crops. Is it dangerous, though? Lung cancer rates are no higher than average in Ramsar, although small population sizes don’t warrant a statistically significant claim. Given that 40% of us will develop cancer during our lifetime, the causes of small-town “cancer clusters” are hard to pin on local factors, rather than on bad luck. Statistical ambiguity also dogs Tularosa, New Mexico, which stands 35 miles from the Trinity nuclear weapons testing site in Nevada. It was here, on 16 July 1945 – just weeks before the bombing of Hiroshima – that the US military conducted a test run of nuclear explosions, coating the backyards of Tularosa homes with ash. The residents struggled to prove the ill effects of the fallout, however, and years of court battles followed. Finally, in 1990 the US Congress lifted the burden of proof for Tularosa victims and offered $50,000 compensation to any downwind residents who contracted certain cancers. One of the difficulties is that there are a dozen ways to measure the severity of ionising radiation. The two SI units are the Gray (Gy), which indicates an actual dose received, and a Sievert (Sv), which is the dose equivalent, a joule of energy per kilogram. The residents of Talesh Mahalleh, for example, receive an average dose of 10 mGy per year – 10 times the International Commission on Radiological Protection’s recommended limit from artificial sources. One house clocked in at 131 mSv per year, or more than 80 times the world average. In theory, one Sievert confers a 5.5% increased probability of cancer. Effects are more severe for fetuses and children, and are much milder for the elderly – unless that one Sievert is delivered over a very short timespan, in which case radiation poisoning leads to death within days for anyone. The missing factor is human behaviour. For instance, gold mining in South Africa’s Witwatersrand Basin – on which Johannesburg’s economy was founded – has left 120 mines’ worth of pyrite tailings, containing 450,000 tonnes of uranium. Torrential rainfall, probably due to climate change, has flooded those ponds and underground stockpiles, flushing radioisotopes into the groundwater. This would clearly be a problem if Jo’burg residents were drinking local water – but the city buys its supplies from Rand Water, which extracts it from the Vaal river, 80km away. Or take Slavutych, a Ukranian city about 50km east of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Slavutych was built specifically to house the displaced residents of Pripyat, the famous abandoned city that now lies within an exclusion zone the size of Lancashire. And yet until the shutdown of the last active reactor at Chernobyl in 2001, staff still worked there, commuting directly from Slavutych train station. Residents are also employed as guards around the exclusion zone – one of the most contaminated places on Earth and also, bizarrely, one of the largest nature preserves in Europe, home to lynx, bison, wolves and brown bears. To make matters worse, 8,000 of Slavutych’s residents were children at the time of the 1986 meltdown. Radiation-related illnesses and thyroid abnormalities are common in Slavutych (though it’s important to keep the danger in perspective: suicide is a 20-fold higher risk for young people in Slavutych than thyroid cancer). How much radiation the people receive depends on the extent to which they eat locally grown food. Surface-level radiation exposure has become less severe over time in the Chernobyl area, but radioactive caesium permeates deeper in the soil. Mushrooms, in particular, are severely contaminated, because they concentrate heavy metals in their tissues. Still, denial prevails, misinformation abounds (vodka is understood by many to cleanse the body of radioactivity), and many residents eat local produce with blithe confidence. Chernobyl remains the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. Recency compounds severity, however, and Fukushima is currently in worse straits. Much of the radioactive material was borne out to sea by wind or waves, but the rest was dispersed in a populated area to the northwest of the plant. Residents of the city of Tomioka have been allowed home, but so far only during the day – and around 40% of them have decided never to return. To see the city, you wouldn’t think it had been fully inhabited as recently as four years ago. Wild boar have interbred with farm pigs and rampaged through the town, with no experience – or fear – of humans. The buildings are crumbling and rats are thriving. The isotopes of concern are iodine-131, which accumulates in and irradiates the thyroid gland for weeks after exposure (but has by now faded in Tomioka), and caesium-137, which permeates Tomioka’s topsoil to a depth of five or more centimetres. Hence the effort to bag up that layer of earth – particularly in playgrounds – for storage in Futaba. How radioactive is Tomioka? As always, it’s hard to say for certain. Here’s the author William T Vollman on a visit in 2013: “Right by the pachinko parlour [the] scintillation counter read 4.2 microsieverts per hour — about 10 times the level of that mildly dangerous drainpipe in Hisanohama. At a nearby house with yellow danger tape around it, the base of a drainpipe registered 22.1 microsieverts per hour. The daily dose would be 530.4 microsieverts; the yearly dose, 193.6 millisieverts. A little perilous, I’d say. The grassy field was a cool 7.5 microsieverts per hour — 65.7 millisieverts per year — while the main highway on which the decontamination trucks kept raising dust was only 3.72 per hour, which still comes to 32 times the recommended annual dose.” Not surprisingly, farmers near the city had to scrap the first year of crops after the disaster, and slash prices on the second. Fisheries have been decimated. Even as the radiation levels above ground stabilise, the legacy for Tomioka and Fukushima Prefecture in general will be a long one, as caesium seeps deeper into the ground on its slow journey to the groundwater. It may be a dubious honour among inhabited cities, but for this year at least, Tomioka is the world’s most radioactive. • This article was amended on 15 May 2015 to clarify that a Sievert (Sv) is the dose equivalent, a joule of energy per kilogram, rather than “the dose a human in that environment would be expected to receive”. It also corrected “ionised” radiation to “ionising”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/oct/22/chinese-property-developers-london-developments-mipim","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-22T09:59:29Z","webTitle":"'It's an insult': Chinese property developers race to the top of London’s skyline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/oct/22/chinese-property-developers-london-developments-mipim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/oct/22/chinese-property-developers-london-developments-mipim","fields":{"headline":"'It's an insult': Chinese property developers race to the top of London’s skyline","bodyText":"The tallest residential tower in western Europe faces off against the biggest business park in the UK, while Thames-side towers offering “a brand new level of luxury” compete with the largest new entertainment resort that Britain has ever seen. In the battle of superlatives that is MIPIM, the international property fair that opened at London’s Olympia exhibition centre on Wednesday, there is one recurring theme: the biggest projects are all the work of Chinese developers. It is expected that £30bn worth of trade deals will be struck during the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s UK visit this week, and much of it has been happening among sprawling city models and virtual fly-throughs of glistening new towers. A delegation of about 100 Chinese investors, developers and construction companies visited on Wednesday afternoon to meet council leaders and land agents, drifting between stands trumpeting the delights of “World Class Worcestershire” and “Northampton Alive”, and posing for selfies in front of regional investment opportunities. But the primary focus was on London, where some of China’s largest property developers are well on the way to realising plans for buildings of an unprecedented scale of ambition and level of luxury. Work has already begun on One Nine Elms, a pair of residential towers of 58 and 43 storeys on the south bank near Vauxhall by Dalian Wanda, China’s biggest developer. Masterminded by Wang Jianlin, the country’s richest man, who enjoys a personal fortune of $42.6bn (£27.6bn), the project’s vision is suitably regal. Designed by the US firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, it will be the first residential tower in the capital with its own five-star hotel, where occupants can enjoy room service in the comfort of their own homes, along with a cinema, gym and a luxury KTV karaoke room – a feature that makes a direct appeal to the Chinese market, where at least 30% of buyers are based. “It’s all about the fun factor,” said a sales rep, handing over a cloth-bound brochure detailing Wanda’s other assets, from Sunseeker superyachts to the vast AMC cinema chain. “Our Chinese clients expect a whole different level of service, so we’re bringing everything they need together on one site.” The agents for the development are so confident about the capital’s booming property market that they are suggesting buyers will make a 23% profit if they sell when the keys to the new apartments are handed over in five years’ time. As suited property agents mingled in the booths, protesters gathered on the streets outside to voice their concerns about the deals being done behind closed doors. “It’s sickening,” said Jake Freeland of the Radical Housing Network, who was protesting with about 40 other campaigners, the crowd almost outnumbered by police, who had sealed off the pavement by main entrance in anticipation after disturbances last year. “The superheated levels of international investment are responsible for the breakup of London’s existing communities, and they’re not giving nearly enough back,” Freeland said. Of the 494 flats in One Nine Elms – which start at £1.3m – only 57 will be classed as “affordable” (shared ownership), falling far short of Wandsworth council’s target of 40%. The Shanghai-based developer Greenland was also here to showcase its £1.2bn investment in London property, including plans for “classic south-west London luxury apartments” on the eight-acre Ram Brewery site in Wandsworth, and what could be the tallest apartment building in western Europe at Canary Wharf. Designed by HOK, Hertsmere House will rise to 67 storeys, if it receives planning permission, putting it at the same height as One Canada Square, the tallest building in Canary Wharf. Its 869 apartments will be some of the most expensive in London, but critics have raised concerns over the building’s deep, dark floor-plates and the fact that the plans don’t meet London’s Housing Design Guide standards. Only 80 flats will be for social rent, while 80 will be intermediate, again falling short of the borough’s requirements. “It’s an insult to London,” says Glenn McMahon of the campaign group Tower Hamlets Renters. “It’s symbolic of the free-for-all in the capital that Boris Johnson has encouraged, seeing property as nothing more than an investment vehicle. Most of these places will sit empty, so it’s doing nothing to help the housing crisis – where 20,000 people are on the waiting list for social housing in Tower Hamlets alone.” Last year, Chinese nationals were granted the most tier 1 investor visas by the UK, which fast-tracks the immigration process for those who want to invest more than £1m in the country, meaning Chinese investors overtook Russians for the first time. Property experts say the wave of Chinese investment in London’s property market is driven by a combination of the recent slowdown of China’s economy and a slackening of restrictions on the amount of money that can be invested overseas, combined with the prestige of having projects in London. “The top Chinese developers are being driven by challenges in the domestic market and global branding needs,” says Eric Zhao, a Chinese markets specialist at Savills. “Companies are beginning to diversify their huge capital outside of China after the restriction on overseas investment was lifted by the regulator. We have already seen the top Chinese firms make a statement in London and we are expecting more to follow.” And it’s not just the luxury residential sector that is catching their attention. The Chinese business park developer ABP is finalising its £1.7bn plan for east London’s Royal Albert Dock, where it intends to build 4.7m sq ft of office and retail space across the 35-acre site, aimed at Chinese companies looking to open UK headquarters. Touted as a third financial district after the City and Canary Wharf, and situated in London’s only enterprise zone, the development hopes to lure companies here though a range of tax benefits, as well as its proximity to City airport and Crossrail. “We’re offering a unique product in the UK office market,” says ABP’s sales manager, Patrick Hurley. “We’re not subject to the same restrictions as other parts of London here, so companies have the freedom to put their logos on the buildings and really make them their own.” Described by Boris Johnson as “a beacon for eastern investors looking west”, the project has come under scrutiny after questions were raised about officials’ cosy relations with ABP and the company’s human rights record in China, where critics say it has been complicit in forced evictions to make way for its developments. ABP and Johnson have denied these claims. “It’s hopefully the first of a number of similar projects in the UK,” says Hurley, describing the vast scheme as tiny compared to what the company normally builds back home. The smallest project ABP has completed in China consists of 400 buildings of 15m sq ft. Echoing Xi Jinping and George Osborne’s talk of a “golden decade” of relations between the two countries – ranging from importing Chinese high-speed trains and nuclear power plants to the UK, to exporting high-quality British pig semen to China in return – Xu Weiping, the flamboyant chairman of ABP, said: “As the Sino-UK relationship has entered the ‘golden era’, the bilateral exchanges have never been stronger.” Nor has the physical impact on the urban fabric of London, as a consequence of this exchange, ever been so extreme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/mar/12/climate-change-reclaim-debate-political-extremes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"We must reclaim the climate change debate from the political extremes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/12/climate-change-reclaim-debate-political-extremes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/12/climate-change-reclaim-debate-political-extremes","fields":{"headline":"We must reclaim the climate change debate from the political extremes","bodyText":"Climate change is real, caused almost entirely by humans, and presents a potentially existential threat to human civilisation. Solving climate change does not mean rolling back capitalism, suspending the free market or stopping economic growth. With those two rather innocuous statements, I have just alienated most people on either side of the climate debate. Today, climate change is no longer just a scientific or an energy problem. Instead, one’s position on global warming has become a badge of political identity in a debate riven by ideological and tribal conflicts. This bodes ill for humanity’s chances of addressing the threat before it is too late. The nature of the scientific consensus, which on the face of it should be pretty straightforward, has become one of the most bitterly contested issues. Each storm, heatwave and temperature rise – or fall – is fought over, not for what it is but for what it represents. An east coast blizzard apparently represents a victory for the naysayers, as exemplified by climate denier Jim Inhofe’s absurd brandishing of a snowball on the floor of the US Senate. Arctic ice melting is a success for the “alarmists”, while Antarctic ice growing is a boon for the “deniers”. This isn’t science; it is politics. The science – as articulated by the IPPC – says the warming of the climate system is “unequivocal”, that the last 30 years were probably the warmest for the last 1,500 years, and that it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century”. Moreover, if current emissions trends continue, warming of 4C or even 6C becomes a possibility this century. No exaggeration is needed to illustrate the gravity of the threat – warming of this magnitude would destabilise major ice sheets, lead to catastrophic shifts in weather patterns, and cause havoc with ecosystems and human societies. The planet’s temperature, along with CO2 levels, would be higher than for tens of millions of years. We should all be able to agree on this. But we can’t, because this scientific narrative seems to have been captured by one, rather extreme, end of the political spectrum. The Guardian’s climate campaign is, in principle, very welcome. But it risks reinforcing this polarisation by leading with two extensive extracts from Naomi Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything: Climate vs Capitalism. Lefties will lap it up; others will see it as evidence that science has been appropriated as cover for an ideological project. For Klein, whose career has always focused on fighting capitalism, climate change merely means we must renew that fight. It doesn’t seem to strike her as odd or fortuitous that this new “crisis”, which she admits she’s only lately discovered, should “change everything” for everyone else but merely reinforce her own decades-old ideological position. Her analysis of the problem is the same as for all the rest of today’s challenges – that it is the fault of multinational corporations, “market fundamentalism” and the “elites”, who in her view control the media and democratic politics. Depressingly, all this confirms what social psychologists have long insisted: that most people accept only scientific “facts” that are compatible with or which reinforce their political identities and worldviews. The environmental left leapt on climate science because it seemed to confirm deeply held notions of the planet being fragile, and modern civilisation being in essence destructive. Moreover, climate science at last seemed to herald the global doom that the eco-Malthusian left had always hoped for. Reacting against this rather miserabilist and dystopian worldview, the political right has increasingly adopted an outright denialist position – attacking the science in a covert war against the political ideology it has been co-opted to serve. The reason half of Americans doubt the science on climate change isn’t because they are stupid or misled by the fossil fuels lobby, but because the global warming issue has now become as much as part of America’s culture wars as abortion or creationism. And let’s not presume that the environmental movement, or the left, has a monopoly on Enlightenment values. Most of those fighting the good climate fight on the basis of scientific consensus fall over themselves to deny an equivalently strong consensus on the safety of nuclear power and GM crops. Witness the recent “no consensus” statement pushed by the greens on GM crops, which exactly parallel “no consensus” statements pushed by the right on the climate. Stuck in their political trenches, neither side sees the irony – or the damage they are doing to science overall. All of this makes climate change much harder to deal with than it would otherwise be. In insisting that tackling carbon emissions must be subordinated into a wider agenda of social revolution and the dismantling of corporate capitalism, Klein isn’t making climate mitigation easier: she is making it politically toxic. In rejecting “too easy” solutions such as nuclear power and advanced renewables technologies (the dreaded “technofix”), the left puts its cards on the table – and confirms what the right has always suspected: that climate mitigation is not a primary but at best a secondary goal. This is also a debate conducted in a western bubble. No one in India doubts that the emergence from poverty of hundreds of millions of people in south Asia will require the production of prodigious amounts more energy – far more than could ever be compensated for by any remotely plausible “energy austerity” path taken by the west. Don’t forget: rich OECD countries have already peaked their CO2 emissions, so pretty much all the future growth will come from Asia, Africa and South America. Forget the political myths: here’s the hard reality. The emergence from poverty of the developing world is non-negotiable. Humanity will therefore double or triple energy consumption overall by 2050. Our challenge is to develop and deploy the technology to deliver this energy in as low-carbon a way as possible, probably using some combination of efficiency, renewables, next-generation nuclear and carbon capture. We need to pour vastly more resources into R&amp;D, and put a significant international price on carbon. But to make any of this happen we will need to recapture the climate debate from the political extremes. We must then work to come up with inclusive proposals that can form the basis of a social consensus that must last decades if it is to have any meaningful effect on the climate change crisis that faces us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-rejects-london-motion-on-fossil-fuel-divestment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T14:38:35Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson rejects London motion on fossil fuel divestment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-rejects-london-motion-on-fossil-fuel-divestment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-rejects-london-motion-on-fossil-fuel-divestment","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson rejects London motion on fossil fuel divestment","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has rejected a motion by the London assembly calling on City Hall’s pension fund to divest from fossil fuels, arguing the UK needs to press ahead with fracking to avoid being reliant on the Middle East and Russia for gas. The mayor of London, who will attend cabinet from this week, said that a more realistic approach was needed than divestment, which he called a “sudden cliff edge”. A transition away from fossil fuels was needed instead, the Tory MP said, blaming Labour for failing to invest in new nuclear power which he claimed had left the UK reliant on gas for its energy needs in the medium term. “The question then is where does one source this natural gas? From Russia and the Gulf or from beneath our own feet?”he wrote to the chair of the assembly on Tuesday. “That question clearly answers itself and we are therefore going to need to invest in exploiting our own domestic energy reserves and explore the potential for fracking in the UK.” Johnson has been vocal before in his support for fracking, saying “no stone should be left unfracked in the cause of keeping the lights on.” Lancashire County council on Wednesday said that two much-anticipated and – delayed planning decisions on applications by shale gas company Cuadrilla to frack would be decided in late June. The mayor was responding to a motion passed by the assembly in March calling on City Hall’s £4.8bn to divest from oil, coal and gas on climate change grounds. The non-binding motion required a response by Johnson who, as had been expected, said that he could not accept its call to divest. He added that he had no power over the pension scheme, the London Pension Fund Authority, although he said it must act in accordance with its fiduciary duty. Senior figures in the financial world including the World Bank’s chief and the governor of the Bank of England have warned of the financial risk to fossil fuel investments if governments act on carbon emissions to avoid dangerous warming, also known as the ‘carbon bubble’. Jenny Jones, the Green party London assembly member who proposed the original motion, said: “The mayor’s reckless indifference will only hurt pension scheme members in the long run, whether from the havoc of climate change or a collapse in fossil fuel asset values. “I’m deeply frustrated that he won’t even get out of coal, for which there should be no future in this country or any other. If the pension funds take their fiduciary duties seriously, and if he were a serious mayor, then fossil fuel divestment should be at the top of their to-do list.” “Time and again, he has demonstrated how little he understands these issues, whether backing fracking for fuels we cannot burn, or questioning the scientific consensus on climate change. London desperately needs a mayor that takes climate change seriously.” Ben Stafford, head of public affairs at WWF UK, said: “Every investment in fossil fuels takes vital capital away from the growing renewable energy industry. There is overwhelming evidence that we are exposed to economic as well as environmental risk if we continue to burn fossil fuels. “It is unfortunate that the mayor has not listened to the London Assembly on this issue. We hope that trustees of the pension fund will take a different view and realise the economic threats to their pensioners’ assets by retaining fossil fuel investments.” On Tuesday, divestment campaigners suffered a setback when Edinburgh university, which has the third biggest endowment of any UK university, declared it would not pull its money out of fossil fuels following a campaign by staff and students. The university said it was better to engage with companies in the industry, and was not a “black and white” issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/22/george-osborne-china-chancellor-britain-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-22T18:38:11Z","webTitle":"George Osborne’s flirtation with China is steering us into uncharted waters | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/george-osborne-china-chancellor-britain-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/george-osborne-china-chancellor-britain-economy","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne’s flirtation with China is a high-stakes gamble for liberal Britain","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth this week felt like the political equivalent of a convention for model railway enthusiasts. The policy debates were a fine technical replica of the issues facing a full-scale government, but none of it seemed relevant to the people elsewhere, heading to work on real trains. This problem predates the Lib Dems’ eviction from office. It expresses their historic loss of a monopoly on the idea that should give them political identity. There are plenty of liberals and democrats in Britain, but they are not neatly aligned to one party. Liberalism colonised the centre of British politics in the 20th century by capturing the upper echelons of the big two. In the 1960s, Labour oversaw a social emancipation from the repressive pettiness of class, religious and cultural establishments; in the 1980s, the Conservatives made a dogma of free enterprise. The two strands then cross-fertilised. Tony Blair disavowed his party’s attachment to state control of the economy; David Cameron imposed tolerance of ethnic and sexual diversity on his tribe. Those shifts have provoked symmetrical dissent. Ukip’s growth after 2010 was driven in large part by conservative reaction against a metropolitan elite bias in Cameron’s first phase of “modernisation”. There was too much cultural continuity from New Labour. The election of Jeremy Corbyn expresses frustration that has brewed for years on the left with New Labour’s economic continuity from Thatcherism. Both phenomena contain a complaint about the consequences of Britain’s embrace of liberal globalisation. Resurgent socialism demands state coercion of markets to level out uneven wealth distribution. A new nationalism demands protection for an imagined indigenous identity with tighter border controls. Tim Farron’s misfortune is to lead a party that bears the name of an elite consensus but sees itself as a band of plucky outsiders. Kippers and Corbynites wave pitchforks against the orthodoxy, while Lib Dems knock politely and ask for readmittance. Locked out of their own tradition, they look in at the windows and grumble that the place is being trashed by political squatters. Liberalism’s next chapter is being written not by Farron but by George Osborne, thousands of miles from Bournemouth. The chancellor is on a visit to China with the primary purpose of drumming up investment and the auxiliary goal of burnishing his credentials as a prime minister-in-waiting. The trip is a statement of intent to make Britain as eager a participant in 21st-century globalisation as it was in the last century, and the one before that. The emblem of this mission is a prospective deal, lubricated with Treasury guarantees, that would allow Chinese companies, in partnership with French-owned EDF, to build a new generation of nuclear power plants in the UK. There are not many developed countries that would allow a foreign state, let alone China, to take such a significant stake in their strategic infrastructure. But that is Osborne’s point. He is placing a bet on Beijing as a source of global growth, and pushing to the front of the queue. “No economy in the world is as open to Chinese investment as the UK,” he said on arrival. The chancellor used a speech at Shanghai’s stock exchange to spell out his confidence that a recent market crash there was just passing volatility; no cause for alarm. “Whatever the headlines … we shouldn’t be running away from China,” he said. “Through the ups and downs, let’s stick together.” This gamble is born partly of necessity and partly of conviction. Osborne is not a laissez-faire fundamentalist. He has an appetite for intervention, with a particular interest in building things. He may have cultivated a political brand as a fiscal disciplinarian, but he would also like his legacy to include the honour of having refurbished Britain, making it fighting fit for the economic future. The two ambitions collide. Infrastructure costs money but he has made a taboo of public borrowing. Chinese cash is meant to bridge the gap. In exchange he offers Britain’s expertise in finance and high-skilled services. A strategic punt on this scale ought to be the subject of intense political scrutiny. Yet the question of whether authoritarian China will be a trustworthy or morally decent shareholder in UK plc is hardly discussed. Beijing does not plug capital shortfalls in Europe, nor open its markets to imports, out of charity. There is a diplomatic as well as an economic quid pro quo. Osborne slipped a reference to Britain’s status as a democracy into his Shanghai speech, but as a minor cultural difference between friends, to be handled with “mutual respect”. This is liberalism stripped of the cumbersome apparatus of civil rights and political freedom to be more economically streamlined. Osborne is blessed with opposition still struggling to cope with the stage of globalisation where rules were set to a “Washington consensus”. Labour hasn’t begun to get its head around the Beijing-friendly version. Jeremy Corbyn’s only apparent beef with the Chinese Communist party is that its embrace of “market philosophy” has been bad for workers’ health and safety. The Lib Dems will complain from the sidelines about the environment, civil liberties and constitutional reform, but that is pressure-group stuff. They are in no state to posit a rival governing creed. The New Labour settlement accepted that government could not tame globalisation but might divert some of the proceeds to spend on public services and compensate those left behind with benefits or tax credits to top up wages. The financial crisis exposed the brittleness of that bargain. It revealed the narrowness of the Treasury’s tax base: its reliance on the City, private debt and a housing bubble to simulate rising prosperity. Recession and stagnation then laid bare a deeper cultural alienation from the whole arrangement – grievances that are as much about national identity, migration and job insecurity as they are about take-home pay. Those problems haven’t gone away, but there is little sign that Osborne is engaged with them. They threaten the consensus that has governed Britain for a generation, of which he is the custodian. Without debate or challenge, the chancellor is steering the country into uncharted waters. He is putting a lot of faith in Beijing, without a backwards glance for Bournemouth. There are liberals in all parties who should find that unsettling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/may/06/federal-election-2019-labor-coalition-polls-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-06T13:07:58Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten appears on Q&A after Scott Morrison's 7.30 interview – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/may/06/federal-election-2019-labor-coalition-polls-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/may/06/federal-election-2019-labor-coalition-polls-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten appears on Q&A after Scott Morrison's 7.30 interview – as it happened","bodyText":"So that’s it.

An example was him pushing back – albeit gently – against Les with his franking credits, arguing Australia had to choose its priorities. His point on his lesson from Kevin Rudd’s capitulation on the greatest moral challenge of our time – known as climate change – was very telling. Stand for something or fall for everything. With the election just two weeks away, Shorten has the bit between his teeth and knows this is it. If he fails on 18 May, his own chance is over. The campaign just got sharper and this will be a fascinating campaign to the end. Thanks for your company and goodnight. Shorten winds up, talking about his mother, her smarts and her lack of opportunities in a working class family. He often references her when discussing his values frame. If you really want to know who Bill Shorten is: I can’t make it right for my mum but I can make it right for everyone else. I don’t care who you vote for – I’d like you to vote for us – I don’t care how long you’ve been here, your accent, family, what job they do, who you worship, but if this country can let people be as talented and as capable by giving them all the same opportunity, we won’t all be the same at the end of the day, but we’re not going to hold this country back. When we are equal and get equal opportunity, we’ll be the best country in the world with no arrogance. That’s my leadership style. A really good question on leadership and government: our royal commissions find there is a failure in leadership culture in human decency and human kindness. Especially in caring for the vulnerable. Community organisations, aged care and disabled service providers are all in the spotlight. Has government effectively outsourced selectively your own responsibility to take care of people in our society? What will your leadership culture be? How will your government guide all of us as a community in relation to our culture in being a decent and caring country to live in? Shorten says his leadership style is as a team player, not a Lone Ranger. My style of leadership is not that of I know best and everyone else must do as I say. I’m not a Lone Ranger. I’m not going to be a Messiah. Don’t believe in the authoritarian strongman that I’ll do this and everyone will follow. That doesn’t work. We’re a country of 25 million people. We have lots of differences and lots of different experiences. I would rather say my leadership style is one of the coach. I want to get the best out of the team. I understand that if you can get the smart people in the room, even if they don’t all agree with each other, you’re more likely to get a better outcome than if you don’t talk to people. I understand that if you want to go and find out what’s happening, they don’t all come to you. So if I’m elected PM, we’re going to do the public meetings and go out and listen to people. So my style of leadership is to listen. My style of leadership is to get the best out of people. This isn’t just an idle statement. Love us or hate us, the Labor party for the last five-and-a-half years has been stable. Not for nothing did Bob Hawke say if you can’t run your own party you can’t run the country. I don’t believe in majorities picking on minorities. This is not political correctness. But in my experience good ideas come in all packages. They can come from the left. They can come from the right. They can come from people who worship Jesus or people who worship Allah or people who don’t worship anyone at all. Good advice and good ideas doesn’t come from what school you went to, not how many generations your family has been in this country, not how rich you are. Good advice is everywhere. A question on the gig economy: “100,000 people are now working on gig economy platforms in the personalised transport sector. They are underpaid, they work between 60 and 80 hours a week for an average of under $10 an hour. They don’t receive any WorkCover or any superannuation and don’t get any expenses for their vehicles. What will you and the Labor Party be doing to outlaw these shared employment practices which are largely carried out by an overseasc orporation using an offshore tax haven to collect and distribute incomes? Good paying jobs and sustainable tax paying small businesses are being destroyed in what has become a free for all race to the bottom?” Shorten says while people have a right to have a say on how their property (Airbnb) or their car (Uber) is used, companies have to pay taxes. He will work with business and unions to ensure the system is fair. Q: Both Labor and Liberal governments have promised to put money into suicide prevention. However, past records show that throwing money at something can be pointless. Tracey Westerman, the 2018 West Australian of the Year, is a respected clinical psychologist and a Njamal woman. How will your government ensure that families like those in the Kimberley can keep their children safe from harm? Shorten says it’s a massive issue and that mental health issues intersect with inequality experienced by Indigenous Australians. He says respected Indigenous senator and longstanding community leader Pat Dodson will be the Indigenous affairs minister. He makes the point that while suicide is the “cutting edge” of the question, the wider issues effecting quality of life cannot be ignored. It’s all connected. If you don’t feel you have stable housing, if you don’t feel you have access to a job, if you’re split up from your family, if you lose connection to country, it all works on each other. So we’ve got the suicide projects but I’d also want to put to you that reconciliation in Australia and Closing the Gap is everything. It’s putting our First Australians and recognising them in the nation’s birth certificate. He references the Uluru Statement from the Heart: I think we can create a national body and I think we can put it into the Constitution to consult. It will not be a third chamber of parliament. Q: Will your Labor government actually repeal the changes to the Medicare bulk billing system that have seen many Australians simply not see a doctor because they can’t afford the gap fees? Shorten says he will repeal the Medicare rebate freeze, which will increase the rebate to patients. He says Labor will index the rebate on a regular basis and put new money into the system on top of indexing. Shorten goes through his promise to provide cancer services. If I can do one thing as PM, but help make sure when you get cancer it may make you sick but it shouldn’t make you poor. If I can honour my commitment that anyone who gets diagnosed with cancer has a lot more access to bulk billing, they don’t have to feel they’ve got to fill in their superannuation form to spend all the money so if they pass away their family, they don’t die in debt. This to me is why you want to be PM. Jones: Are you worried if you say anything definitive about Adani the CFMEU could give Scott Morrison the kind of photo opportunity they handed John Howard back in 2014, which effectively undid Mark Latham? Shorten: I’m not worried about that, no. Why not? Shorten says: Because I’m not. Because there’s other issues. I’ve got plenty to put to the people of Australia. Shorten is asked, if you are serious about climate change, rule out Adani no matter what it does to the Labor vote in Queensland. Shorten says he accepts things are changing but he will adhere to the science. No. What I’m going to do is adhere to the science. Adhere to the law. I’m going to make sure we don’t have sovereign risk. There is no doubt in my mind that we’re moving to more renewables. There’s no doubt in my mind that coal-fired power is getting more expensive and renewables are getting cheaper. But at the end of the day we have to have a framework of laws. We have to have a framework for investment. Jones asked what Shorten learned on Kevin Rudd’s retreat on the greatest moral challenge of our time. Shorten: What I learned out of 2009, you can stand for something or fall for everything and we’re going to stand and fight on climate change. We’re not retreating. Q: Recent studies show irreversible climate change effects by 2030. How would a Shorten government expand domestic policy as well as work internationally to ensure our future is not threatened by the prospect of the world becoming uninhabitable? Shorten: That is such a dumb question to say what does it cost without looking at the cost of inaction. You can’t have a debate about climate change without talking about the cost of inaction. And then to the Coalition’s record: Climate change is costing and if anything shows you how broken the last six years, maybe 10 years of Australian politics is, is that whenever someone wants to have a crack at doing something on climate change, the knuckle draggers and the cave dwellers drag them down. If this government was serious on climate change, Malcolm Bligh Turnbull would still be PM of Australia. Shorten repeats that he did not agree with Paul Keating on his view of security agencies, that they had not discussed those particular views. He’s an elder statesman of Australian politics. He’s a grown up. And in my party you’re allowed to have an opinion. Not a hope that I’ll disown Paul Keating. But on that particular view I don’t agree with him. Shorten is asked whether he values the US or China more. Shorten says he is loyal to the US relationship but thinks Australia should be independent. I do not look at our relationship with China through one prism of strategic risk. Of course we want to maintain our national security and our cybersecurity, our national interests. But I tell you what – whatever this government has accomplished in the last six years in terms of economic growth has been written on the back of exports to north Asia and China. I think it’s a great thing we have so many Chinese Australians, so many people of Chinese ethnicity have joined their story to the Australian story. What you won’t get from me is the crude oversimplification that somehow there’s, it’s a bipolar world and you’re for one and not the other. Next question about Donald Trump. The questioner reminds Shorten that he was critical of Trump prior to his election. Shorten says he would work with Trump professionally and politely. But what I’ll also do is never compromise our national interests. My foreign policy will be independently minded and it will speak with an Australian accent. It will prioritise working in the Pacific with New Zealand, with Indonesia, with our near neighbours. I understand the importance of north Asia economically and the rise of India and understand and respect the shared history of the Anzus alliance. And foreign policy will not be a second-order issue under my leadership. Liv says her mum works in aged care and hears every day how short they are in funding. How does the Labor party aim to support and fund the recommendations found by the aged care royal commission? Shorten asks Liv to thank her mum and reminds the audience that “the government accused me of elder abuse for raising a royal commission”. One is that we’ve got to provide better training. Two is we’ve got to find more money. Three, we have to find more staff. Jones asked why Labor says it will support childcare workers (with a pay top up) and not aged care workers. I don’t think it’s quite fair to play that Hunger Games approach. In terms of early childhood educators, which is a separate issue, they have been neglected too ... did you know that they are the 92nd lowest paid profession in Australia out of 96? Les says he will lose 20% of his income as a result of Labor’s franking credit policy. Q: Bill Shorten has said he wants to increase the basic wage for low income earners, yet he seems happy for a retired couple to live on less income than the basic wage. How does this equate to Labor’s slogan for making Australia a fairer country? Shorten says a tax refund for those who don’t pay tax is a gift. Did you know half a million Australians pay on average $11,000 tax a year. Every dollar these half a million people pay in taxes goes to the gift. To people who happen to be lucky enough to own shares in retirement, get a dividend and then we top it up. I know it’s a complicated explanation and affects 4% of people. What we’ll also do for Les, when he’s sick we’ll make sure Medicare is better funded. Shorten says the system was never designed to ensure people spent none of their own savings to pay for their retirement. What you’re saying is when you’re a retiree you never have to use any of your shares. The whole principle of superannuation was to give you enough to be comfortable in retirement. It was never meant to be that the government would top you up, you could keep all your shares and you’d never have to spend a cent in retirement. John asks can Bill Shorten explain why he has remained so unpopular. Shorten is quite feisty. They said when I was the opposition leader against Abbott that he was unbeatable. I remember the headlines. Tony Abbott was going to be there for three terms. I outlasted him. And Malcolm Turnbull, the Sun King. Some journalists, the end of the two-party state. Anyway, he’s probably watching this from New York, isn’t he? *waves* Then we got to Scott Morrison. He’s the latest Liberal. This is the point. I know Australians are over instability. And the point of the last 2,032 days is this, my team’s united. Lillian is 61 and finds herself unemployed after the closure of her small business. She is having no luck finding a job. Shorten: She describes a whole lot of forgotten people in Australia. Did you know that in Australia if you’re over 55 your average period of unemployment is twice as long? There is age discrimination in Australian workplaces. He describes the people he sees when he does the shopping on Sunday. The times I’ve seen well-dressed people, immaculately presented, they have their CV in a plastic sleeve and you can see the sting of rejection in their eyes. They say, “Why doesn’t anyone want to give us a go?” We have put a specific measure on the table which will reward companies for investing in older people. And we will review the Newstart when we come in. George is still not happy so Shorten gives the opportunity cost argument. If we spend money on negative gearing, we miss out on other areas. Shorten: The only point of difference is not about any of your current finances, but is it right that we spend billions of dollars to give people the ability to claim a subsidy when they invest in a property in the future or should we properly fund our hospitals and schools? It’s not a zero sum game. George is worried about Labor’s negative gearing policy and says it won’t be profitable. George: “If you’re elected I’ll be selling and enjoying the surplus funds over the next 10 years. I doubt I’m alone. Have you considered the cost that you’ll pass on and I’ll be eligible for full age pension in the future?” Shorten says the policy is grandfathered so current investors won’t be affected. What we’re saying is on January 1 in 2020, new purchases of existing housing won’t be able to claim a government subsidy. You use the word tax. If I’m not giving you a subsidy for you making a loss on an investment property, that ain’t a new tax. It just means you’re not getting a subsidy. Shorten is asked about Labor’s negative gearing policy and its effect on the property market and the economy as a whole in terms of consumption and growth. Shorten: They won’t. Property prices have fallen under this government. They don’t seem to take any responsibility for that. A young questioner, Alex, asks about the generational wealth differences between his parents’ generation and his own, in regard to housing costs and university debts. Shorten: Young people get a bad rap in the political debate. The reality is not only do you have housing a lot more expensive than it used to be, not only do you have to pay for university in a way your previous generation didn’t, but even things like Medicare which you should pay, you’re less of a challenge on the health system than the older people. So I want to see some measures which put young people at the front. I’ll tell you another way we’ll help young people going forward, we’re going to take proper action on climate change. Shorten says Labor’s policies are not a “generational square up” but then: In Australia, if you have a lot of capital, you’re taxed far more lightly than if you make your money from income. Jones asks about the state of the economy and the possibility the Reserve Bank will lower interest rates. Asked if Labor’s policies could push Australia into recession, Shorten says no. I actually think this economy is more likely to grow sustainably where millions of Australian households are getting regular wage rises, getting support of cost of living, have properly funded healthcare system. Q: Can Australia afford a Labor government with their promises of free dental care for pensioners and reduced childcare costs for young families? Shorten says not addressing issues does not make the costs of them go away. There’s an assumption that if we don’t help pensioners with the cost of their dental care, that if we do nothing that somehow that isn’t in itself a cost. There’s 145,000 older Australians on waiting lists for dental care. Not helping them afford dental care doesn’t make the problem go away. Not helping pay for people’s dental care doesn’t cure your teeth decay or your problem. Shorten rejects the government formulation that Labor’s measures on negative gearing and franking credits are higher taxes. He says removing subsidies are not tax increases. Shorten goes through the policies more individually. Jones asks the questioner if he is happy with the answer (given Shorten had not given a specific answer on whether overall the tax burden would be higher). Thomas says he is happy. Shorten is chuffed and smirks at Tony Jones. Q1: How is the Labor party going to pay for all of their proposals and under the Shorten government would there be higher taxation for the average Australian? Shorten delivers a general pitch for Labor. For the last five-and-a-half years Labor’s been working on its policies. And we’re able to pay for them. The basis of our policies is that we think that it’s time for real change in Australia. He says Labor will reveal costings later this week. Tony Jones says Scott Morrison was also invited to appear on Q&amp;A but is not available. From earlier tonight, Katharine Murphy: Bill Shorten is coming up shortly on Q&amp;A. Morrison claims he has had to offer nothing to Palmer in government in exchange for the preference deal. Finally, Sales asks who will have the upper hand in a newly elected Coalition government on climate change policy, the “mainstream” or the right of the party. Morrison said “I will”. Sales suggests at least Labor and the Greens’ policies are based in science and evidence. Morrison: Richard Di Natale thinks it’s OK for people to invade farms. I don’t think that’s terribly sensible. Richard Di Natale supports death taxes. Richard Di Natale wants 100% renewable target, which will basically crash our economy. I don’t think that’s sensible at all. Scott Morrison will not enter into the National party’s preference deal with One Nation because they are a separate party. (Even though they are the LNP in Queensland.) Then Morrison is asked about his preference deal with Clive Palmer. Do I think the United Australia party is a bigger risk to Australia’s jobs and economy than the Labor party and the Greens? No. I think Bill Shorten and the Greens are a much greater risk to people’s jobs and the economic and national security of this country than the alternative. Sales asks when your tax plan is fully operational, how much will somebody earning $200,000 a year save on their tax bill compared to today? Morrison: They’ll be paying the 45% tax rate and that’s around about $11,000. Q: How is it fair that you’re delivering to somebody on that income $11,000 a year but somebody on a median income will only get around $1,400? Morrison: The big change we’re making is to drop the 32.5 cent rate down to 30 cents. That impacts on 9.2 million Australians – 9.2 million. Morrison admits emissions have been increasing under the government but the Coalition would meet the targets set internationally. I accept there’s a difference between the emissions reduction target we’re putting forward at this election, which doesn’t choose between the economy and environment – it chooses both – and what the Labor party is proposing. Scott Morrison says the Liberal launch won’t be about “hoopla”. It’s not about who’s coming. It’s about who will be listening. (In other words, don’t expect the last few Liberal prime ministers.) Scott Morrison talks up the government’s track record to which Sales counters, why did you dump Malcolm Turnbull then? The previous PM, Mr Turnbull, lost the confidence of the Liberal party room and they changed PMs. What I did when I became PM after that was to make sure that can’t happen again. Morrison references the leadership rules changes in both the Liberal and Labor parties. Scott Morrison is trying to walk the line between an optimistic view of the economy with sounding the warning bells on letting Labor back into government. Sales notes the Reserve Bank is considering cutting interest rates. If the Reserve Bank does do that tomorrow, it will be a sign that the economy is not going that well, won’t it? You’re right to point out that there are various real risks in the global economy over the next five years. And particularly the tensions between the US and China ... now is not the time for record spending growth. Labor are promising to spend 30 times more than the government in this campaign alone. After Morrison talked about “Labor’s debt”, Sales says the Coalition has doubled the size of net debt since it’s been in office, ie, it’s not Labor’s debt. It is because that’s what set us on the course to that debt, says Morrison. Leigh Sales asks Scott Morrison: “What would be the point of a Morrison government for the next three years?” You’re right. It is a choice between two different ways forward. He talks about job creation and “we brought the budget back into surplus”. Sales pulls him up to say the surplus is a projection. That is, it is a projected surplus for next year. The SMH reports the controversial former NSW Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen has lent her voice to Abbott’s campaign for re-election in Warringah. She has described Abbott as “a full-time, committed member of Parliament, member for Warringah...But because he is so physically and mentally disciplined, 24 hours of his day is really given to others.” Good evening blogsters, welcome to the evening shift. Scott Morrison is coming up shortly on the ABC’s 7.30. In the meantime, here is Katharine Murphy’s campaign catchup. With the campaigns at rest, we will tuck the blog up – but only for a nap. With so much going on tonight, Gabrielle Chan will be back with you just before 7.30pm to blog Scott Morrison on 7.30 and following another short break Bill Shorten on Q&amp;A. So go take a break. Get something to eat. Go for a walk. Stare at a wall. We’ve got a long 12 days to get through and this week is going to be a doozy. I’ll leave you in Gabi’s glorious hands. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning. As always – take care of you. Both campaigns have gone dark for the moment, as they prepare their respective leaders for their respective ABC media appearances tonight. And both campaigns should be in Canberra by late tomorrow, for the last leaders’ debate on Wednesday. So Tony Abbott and Peter Dutton may be very, very busy defending their electorates on Sunday and miss the launch. The interview wraps up with some questions on the Liberal’s campaign launch, which will be this Sunday in Melbourne – including, who will be there. Or more accurately, who won’t be there. Why is it on Mother’s Day? Well, we chose to do it on the last weekend before election day. There will be plenty of mothers who are there. Indeed, mothers on stage, as members of the government and mothers in the audience as members of the Liberal party and, of course, as husbands, we’re also there as well. This launch is important, it’s happening in Melbourne, and as a proud Victorian, I can say in Australia’s greatest city, I’m looking forward to being with the prime minister at this important event. Will Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott be there? You know, the two most recent former Liberal PMs? Josh Frydenberg: Well, obviously I don’t know. PK: You’re the treasurer. JF: He’s overseas at the moment, Tony Abbott is probably busy in Warringah. PK: So will Tony Abbott be there? You’re saying he will be busy in Warringah, you don’t think he will be there? JF: Who will be there will be the prime minister, myself, the other colleagues in Victoria contesting their seats. We have local members across the country who will be busy in their electorates, given there will be one week to go. On the ballot paper, in the seat of Cook, will be Scott Morrison, and the alternative to being prime minister of this country is Bill Shorten. That’s who the contest is between and no doubt Scott Morrison and I will be there to put our best foot for ward as a party and team. PK: I know you will be there. Let’s check on a few other names. Peter Dutton – it was the opposition leader that made some jokes about Peter Dutton today, saying that he said people weren’t safe to go out on the streets of Melbourne to go to dinner. Will he be coming? JF: You will have to wait and see on the day. What I can tell you is that the prime minister and myself and our other Victorian colleagues will also be there and we will all be there with the same message, that the Coalition will strengthen the economy, Bill Shorten will spend more, he will tax more, he will weaken the economy. That continues: PK: Not the proportionality. That’s not the question. So $77 billion is the figure the Australia Institute keeps quoting. What is your alternative figure, so we can settle this. You’ve been avoiding it for a day at least, which is why I have to go to it. I find it torturous to ask. If you answer, we can end this. JF: Patricia, it’s a Labor Party stunt. PK: No, it’s a reasonable question. JF: It’s not. I’m going back to what is the principle and the policy and the approach and process we are following that the Labor Party followed when they were in government. PK: You won’t answer it. Let’s leave it there. JF: I want to point out to you that someone who earns $200,000 under our tax plan will pay ten times as much tax. PK: That wasn’t the question. JF: That’s as someone who earns $45,000. PK:The Prime Minister says we haven’t changed anything for those earning in the top tax rate, but you are planning to. You’re reducing the top marginal tax rate - you said that budget papers show they will get an 11,000 tax cut. Why did the PM say that when it’s not the case. JF: To correct you, we’re not changing the rate. PK: The rate is 47 cents in the dollar, when you include the Medicare levy, it’s the Labor Party who is proposing with a so-called deficit levy, though they talk about surplus to increase it from 47 cents to 49, which Paul Keating himself called too punitive and attacked the Labor Party for that approach. We’re not proposing to change the rate. The Prime Minister is accurate there and making the point. What happens when you change the thresholds at the lower end or you change the rate, for example, 32.5 to 30, there is flow-through, to people on the upper end of the scale as well. Question: $70bn is the figure for your tax cuts for higher income earners – people earning $180,000. Frydenberg: Well, not that... PK: You do, so what is the figure? JF: The figure was one in the budget, in budget paper number one, table number four, sets out clearly the breakdown of our $158bn tax cuts – $95bn of which is to reduce the rate from 32.5 to 30 cents in the dollar for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000, designed to stop bracket creep. PK: The figure is $95bn? JF: $95bn. PK: So the $77bn figure that Bill Shorten held up? JF: Well, I think you will find that what Labor are talking about and what I’m talking about are different. PK: I’m – my question – you’re answering a different question? JF: I’m answering a question about higher income earners over $180,000. PK: And $77bn is what the Australia Institute says. I understand you’re contesting it. Tell me the figure. JF:I can say clearly to you that we as a government are not proposing to change the rate of tax for those earning above $200,000. PK: That’s not what I asked you, treasurer. I asked you what the figure was. JF: I’m telling you there is a figure in the budget, which is $95bn. PK: You’re telling me it’s an answer to a different question. I’m asking you the question and you’re not answering it. JF: Patricia, in terms of budgets and the same principle applied when the Labor party was in office – when you change the tax brackets or the thresholds, you provide the cost to the bottom line of that particular change, which we have done very clearly. What your question is going to, is what is the on our progressive tax system? What I can say to you and your viewers and listeners is that under our tax plan, when fully rolled out, what you will see is the top 5% of taxpayers who broadly equate to those on the top tax bracket, will pay a greater proportion of the overall tax burden. Yes, says an exasperated Patricia Karvelas, but what are you actually going to do: Answer: ALL OF THE BUZZ WORDS Frydenberg: There’s a lot of things that we want to do that have been set out in the budget. There’s also broader issues that are really important, that we are ensuring a safer, more secure Australia, that we’re investing record amounts in our defence, again, which was opposed by the Labor party. PK: The point of my question is that none of that is contentious and it won’t take your entire term – so it’s really a question about your vision for the three years. You have provided the electorate very little information about what you will do beyond this big tax Packing Room age, which of course we’ve talked about, so what is it? JF: Again, I disagree with the premise of your question. I think the vision was set out in the budget, and it’s based on our values, and our values are encouraging personal responsibility, reward for effort, a safety net for those who need it and encouraging the individual and their enterprise. They are our values. They underpin what we do. Not only what we do economically, but what we do in the national security space which is really successful. We’ve been successful, whether it’s in border protection, national security legislation, part of the economic agenda and the evidence of what that achieved is there for all to see. Australia’s economy is growing second only to the United States among G7 countries – we created more than 1.3 million new jobs and are spending record amounts on hospitals, schools as well as congestion-busting infrastructure. That’s a record we’re proud of. We go for a third time and this time we get an answer about the budget and Labor’s agenda: Question: Like what? You have not articulated it. None of the areas you’re describing are contested in terms of legislation. With respect, you have a very long period of time where we don’t know what you will be doing. Josh Frydenberg: I think that is a very inaccurate premise to your question, because what we have done is laid down a clear economic plan for the next decade, which is in the budget, and all those things are not approved of by the Labor party. Indeed if they were, they would have done it themselves. I want to bring you back to tax because the Labor party is saying they will unwind some of the legislative measures that we did in last year’s budget, particularly abolishing the 37 cents in the dollar tax bracket, but also they oppose what we’re doing this time around, which is reducing the threshold from – the rate for the tax bracket between $45,000 and we’re reducing it to 30%. That is some of the things that the Labor party is proposing that we will fight in the parliament about. Patricia Karvelas, chatting to Josh Frydenberg about what is the Coalition’s legislative agenda – and he replies with the budget promises: We have a series of things. That’s in relation to the royal commission. The government’s economic plan is set out very clearly in the budget. It’s in three different parts. The first is how do we repair the budget by paying back Labor’s debt and we’re delivering the first surplus in more than a decade in 2019-20 and paying back all government debt by the end of the decade. The second part of the budget is in relation to tax cuts, as you point out – $158bn worth of tax cuts, as well as $100bn worth of infrastructure spending, as well as what we’re doing to create 80,000 new apprentices and finally the social dividend, which is the record spending on hospitals and schools and childcare and aged care and disability support, which is really important, and of course more drugs on the PBS which we have done to the tune of $10.5bn with 2,000 new drugs listed. We’ve done all of that without increasing taxes, the same can’t be said of the Labor party. That’s the clear choice at this election. She tries again and he responds with Labor’s agenda: Well, I don’t accept what you say. It’s not the work of government – not the work of government that is uncontested. The Labor party oppose significant parts of our agenda, including, for example, free trade agreements, which we’ve successfully done and dealt with with Korea and China and Japan, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Bill Shorten called dead in the water, and the Indonesian free trade agreement. Of course the Labor party would like to unwind what we’ve done in industrial relations, particularly the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Jessica Whelan, the dumped Liberal candidate for Lyons who intends on continuing to run as an independent (all the other candidates could technically also be elected as independents, but Whelan is the only one to explicitly state she will campaign to remain in the race), has denied she lied to Scott Morrison about her social media posts. From Adam Morton’s story: Dumped Tasmanian Liberal candidate Jessica Whelan has denied she lied to Scott Morrison about anti-Muslim Facebook posts and said she warned the party about her “strong opinions” on social media before she was pre-selected. ...Morrison backed Whelan when the allegedly fake post became public, saying it was not hard to believe an image could be doctored, but the party withdrew its support on Friday after more comments came to light. Frontbencher and party spokesman Simon Birmingham said the party was “not going to tolerate racist comments”. Asked if he felt he had been lied to, the prime minister said “yes”. Whelan told Guardian Australia she had not lied to anyone. “As soon as I heard [Morrison’s comment] I thought, ‘What?’ I haven’t had a conversation with him. He refused to pick up the phone and talk to me,” she said. “I spoke to the Liberal party but what information they relayed I don’t know.” Well that looks like it answers that question: It’s amazing the differences an election campaign can make to people’s positions. From ABC Adelaide, where Georgina Downer is again trying to take the seat of Mayo off Rebekha Sharkie: Mayo Liberal candidate Georgina Downer says the minimum wage is “about right” after previously pushing for it to be abolished along with penalty rates. In an interview with ABC Radio Adelaide this morning, Ms Downer backtracked on comments she made while working at the Institute of Public Affairs about the role of the Fair Work Commission. In 2017, she said the minimum wage and penalty rates should be abolished. Last year, she said the commission set “artificially high wages”. Today, she changed her tune. “I think they basically do get it about right, but it’s an independent process, which I think is important,” she said. “We shouldn’t have people’s wages treated like political footballs.” I guess that’s one way for an independent candidate to get their message out: I once forgot to prepare a drama oral, so did an interpretative dance to Metallica’s Enter Sandman as a comment on how Australian society interacts with its democracy. I expect Alex Dyson’s (admirable) efforts will go about as well as mine did when the results are handed down. It’s Labour Day in Queensland, so that’s where Brendan O’Connor was today. Labor’s industrial relations spokesman marched in Brisbane, but he stopped to say this to the cameras a little earlier: I’ve got a joke for you – why did Scott Morrison cross the road? Because he wanted to avoid Q&amp;A. I mean the fact is Scott Morrison is scared of going on an ABC program because he doesn’t want to give the detail of the $77bn [high income tax cuts] to the public. And he really needs to do that. He needs to do that to be upfront with the Australian people. Just reading through Scott Morrison’s transcript from his press conference earlier today about how he said it was the people of Gilmore who will decide who wins the election: It’s important because here in the seat of Gilmore, they will not only decide who their next member of Gilmore will be – and obviously we want to see Warren as the Liberal candidate elected, as the local Liberal member here for Gilmore, who will do an outstanding job. But it’s also one of those key seats around the country where the people of Gilmore, the people on the south coast, will get to decide who the next prime minister should be. Whether I should continue in that job as prime minister, or whether Bill Shorten should become prime minister. So it will be a key choice for the people of the south coast about who they want to lead this country for the next three years.” Someone might need to tell Tony Abbott that, because he has repeatedly said it is the people of Warringah who will make that decision. I mean, I know I am no expert, but given the Coalition holds 73 seats, and the Labor party holds 69 seats and you need 77 to lead, if you have a Speaker from your own side of parliament, then it is more than one electorate who will decide the outcome of the election. It is literally all 151 of them. 700 different, comprehensive different measures in the budget mention – DRINK. What’s the government’s plan for the first 100 days? “It’s not about the first 100 days,” Birmingham says, it is about the first three years. Should we have a referendum to change section 44? Simon Birmingham says there will be a review of the campaign, after the campaign, and any of those issues will be dealt with then. Simon Birmingham wants to know what Labor means when it says “a living wage”, saying it’s a “glib statement” with “nothing behind it”. Labor says it will consult with business before making any changes. Also describes me after the five coffees I have had today. (Or a quiet Saturday night) Simon Birmingham is in Canberra, to do the afternoon ‘here is how Labor was terrible today’ wrap up for the Coalition. Scott Morrison may make another campaign stop, but Bill Shorten and Labor have gone a bit quiet, while they prepare for tonight’s bad show appearance. Morrison will be bunking down very soon to prepare for his interview with Leigh Sales tonight. Phonetics has failed us all, at one point or another. Acoss has responded to the treasurers’ debate: Australia already has a low tax base – 8th lowest in the OECD. The Government is now proposing the largest tax cut package seen, mostly benefitting those on high incomes, without corresponding action to close tax shelters or strengthen the income tax base. The Opposition’s tax package is smaller, and their policies include a range of measures to tackle tax shelters. “As ACOSS argued on Federal Budget Night, now is not the time for more tax cuts. “The analysis of the Federal Budget expenditure reveals that the next government is unlikely to be able to provide essential services and social security payments, while also providing large tax cuts. We will need to choose between these two competing priorities.” The 2019 Budget is built on the dubious assumption that, without major new spending cuts, public spending over the next four years will be held at the lowest levels of growth in 50 years: Overall real growth in Commonwealth spending is estimated to fall to an average of just 1.3% per year for the next 4 years, half the growth rate from 2013 to 2018; Real spending growth per person (adjusted for inflation and population growth) is projected to be zero over the next 4 years; Real growth in health funding is projected to average 0.7% a year (without adjusting for population growth), compared with 3.0% over the last 4 years. Real growth in social security and welfare funding (including the NDIS) is projected to average 1.8% a year (compared with 2.0% over the last 4 years) Average spending levels after inflation are expected to fall over the next 3 years in dental health (-0.7%), employment services (-2.5%), family payments (-0.7%), housing (-2.7%), and tertiary education (-0.6%). The above projections lock in the effects of previous funding cuts, including a six year freeze in Medicare benefits for doctor’s visits and cuts to dental care and residential aged care; together with a slow rollout of the NDIS. Question: Paul Keating said there would be a dramatic shift in relations with China under Labor. Do you share that view and what about someone who has been detained since January without seeing a lawyer. Shorten: Not everything is an argument between us and the government, especially on national security. It is very concerning about the detention of this person. We support the efforts of the government. We’ve had some briefings on it. But I would just say for this matter I wouldn’t conflate it into the election cycle because we’re about looking after this fella. Question: Are you not happy with the format on Wednesday? Shorten: We want Wednesday’s debate. Hang on a sec. We wrote to the other people, the Liberals, six days ago. They’ve just sort of, there’s been some movement in the bush and they’ve materialised and said, “OK. If we have to we’ll do it.” I won’t pull out of a debate. Question: There will be a debate on Wednesday night? Shorten: I hope. I’m going on Q&amp;A tonight. We don’t need to go to Liberal party invitation-only events to answer questions. Anyway, we’ll go on Q&amp;A. Happy to do Leigh Sales a couple of times. We’ll do our chats. Question: Will you get Mr Albanese to debate Peter Dutton. He seems keen to? Albanese: I want to debate my counterpart. Shorten: Peter Dutton had a debate with Ali France and it didn’t go well. I will go back to where we started here. Mr Dutton may be feeling the pressure in his seat. That’s not my problem. I’ll tell you what is my problem and we’ll finish up the press conference on this point. My problem is this government is pretending they can’t do more for Nepean hospital and can’t do more to help cancer treatments. This government is pretending it can’t afford to help three million pensioners with the cost of their dental care. When they tell Australians they’ve can’t afford to do more on healthcare, they’re telling Australians they don’t deserve it. There’s 13 days till the election, it’s about a very clear choice. For us it’s about prioritising Australian hospitals, Australian patients, Australian healthcare over providing thousands of dollars in tax cuts to the top end of town or looking after property investors or going soft on multinationals. Question: Mr Dutton said he wants a debate with your next home affairs minister. Will you stump somebody up for that? Shorten: I’m glad you went to that. Anthony has been struggling to find someone to debate him. I think Michael McCormack is your opposite number. As for debates, I might let Anthony talk about the difficulty of finding Coalition ministers. Anthony Albanese: Look, we in Bill’s team have been quite happy to have debates and I’ve written to Michael McCormack, I’ve sent text messages, I’ve sent smoke signals to try and find him. He can’t be found. He’s the Deputy PM of Australia, he’s in charge of infrastructure, but I can’t find him to have a debate. We proposed at one stage the National Press Club this Friday and apparently there’s now problems with that. I anticipate the problems will dissolve on about May 19 and be prepared to have a discussion. But it goes down to what the government’s attitude is towards debates in general. You’ve been travelling in these travelling parties for a few weeks and for a couple of weeks they were saying that this bloke didn’t want to debate their bloke. Bill didn’t want to debate Scott. That wasn’t true. We were negotiating all of that through. What we know now is that Scott Morrison basically got creamed by Bill Shorten in the two debates that have been held. Creamed absolutely. 1-0. Then 2-0. There were going to be three rounds. When you’re 2-0 behind, you maybe concede. But he should have further debates. There’s been some agreement about the National Press Club. But the question is why is Scott Morrison chicken to go on Q&amp;A? Why won’t he go on a program that goes for an hour, where you have questions from a host, questions from the audience in a, it’s a tough gig doing Q&amp;A for an hour. He’s not prepared to do it. He should do it. He should stop running scared. If he went on Q&amp;A and broke out of the egg and went on, what he might get asked is where is the $77bn coming from? Question: He was asked for the same format on Sky News? Albanese: Not everyone has Sky News, with due respect. Q&amp;A and the ratings that Q&amp;A get on a Monday night, compared with – I’ve got to tell you, Sky News on a Friday night, I’m sure is very good. I don’t know because the footy’s on. That’s what I’m watching. I’m watching the footy on Friday night. I’m sure they are good. He should do Q&amp;A and he should do it, he should commit to do it because they advertise tonight what’s on next week. He should just do it. Question: Given your faith in the Labor government’s ability to work well with national security agencies, would there be any change to Australia’s foreign approach to China? Shorten: I gave my Lowy address. But what I said there is that when it comes – we are going to work with our national security agencies and I’ve had more briefings in opposition than when the Liberals were in opposition for the national security agency because we take it seriously. With China, we have to mind our national security interests. There is a debate that says we shouldn’t look at the rise of China solely through the prism of strategic risk. China buys a lot of our materials. What we will be is put Australia’s interests first. We’ll mind the security, we’ll also make sure that we try and gain the best deal I can for Australian jobs, Australian exports, dealing with China and other Asian economies. Question: Who is going to be your home affairs minister if you’re elected? Don’t Australians have to know and have confidence of the person that’s in charge? Shorten: I think it would be premature of me to declare victory in this election, so I won’t. We will have a home affairs department. We have announced some of our positions and we’ll finalise it when people get elected or don’t. Peter Dutton came out of witness protection briefly and it sort of reminds me about the Liberal launch. Mr Morrison will have it in Melbourne. I wonder who will be there. I have my whole team at my launch. Will we see the minister for the environment? Will she, she’s more on the endangered species list than the ones we’re trying to protect. As for Peter Dutton, he’s the one who famously said you can’t go and have dinner in Melbourne. He might be too scared to have dinner in Melbourne. Will he be too scared to turn up to the launch? Question: Can you explain why you’ve scaled a policy back to the 2016 election and install business sector is concerned about red tape and compliance in hiring these people. What sort of assurances can you offer it won’t be particularly burdensome and worth their while to do this? Shorten: My word it’s worth their while. I was pleased to see the Council of Small Business Association, but there was something else he said. He thought this was a good idea. They don’t want to get tied up in red tape. Fair enough. There’s a real problem in Australia. You can see it every Saturday when you go to the shopping centres. I run into well presented, very hard working older Australians. But they’ve been on the rough end of economic change. They’ve lost their job. We have a problem in Australia, don’t we? Once you’re 55 and 60, the old economic job market is pretty harsh. For no other reason than you’re older. I run into people all the time who have got their CVs, 30 or 40 years of work experience. They don’t get an even go. This is a real problem. Not a confected issue. People in this age group spend twice as long on the unemployment queue. I want to use a little bit of incentive to help small business, perhaps give an older person a go. Let’s call it for what it is. We’re a bit quick in this modern age to write-off the experience of older people. I think it’s a good initiative. We’re mindful of the issue of red tape. We won’t get bogged down in that. Do you know what happens right now to older people? They get sent to job interviews which are not appropriate, just so the job provider can tick a box and get a grant of money. We’re fair dinkum. In terms of compared to 2016 which is the other party I’ll question, don’t ignore the Australian investment guarantee. A $3.3 billion baby which is great for business. Did you know that if you invest, if we get elected that is, if you spend more than $20,000 investing in new technology which is productive and on a depreciation schedule, we’re going to give you 20% up-front extra. If you buy a $100,000 unit for your factory or for your business, extra 20% can be written off day one. That means you get money back for your investment. It’s estimated that this will enhance wages and it will enhance employment. So if you look, rather than just cherry picking one program which we announced, which is as good one all on its own, and you put together what we’re doing, we are doing more for small business than the Government. Question: There have been concerns raised about Labor’s transgender policy, that your sexual orient commissioner could influence GPs on how they provide advice – do you respect that opinion? Shorten: I think that’s rubbish. That’s not our approach. It’s a rubbish story and no doubt the government will help fuel it. We’ve heard this government run all sorts of desperate smokescreens and what have you. I tell you what I’m interested in, I’m interested in the fact Sandy and Kim have had to pay $100,000 out of their own pocket to get cancer care. It might not concern the government. It concerns me. There’s a real choice at this election. For me it’s not about those sort of rubbish stuff which emerges from the fringes. What concerns me is that Australians in the fight of their life have to face the chance of going poor when they fight cancer. It’s pretty straightforward. Cancer makes you sick but it shouldn’t make you poor. Cancer makes you sick but it shouldn’t make you poor. Question: Do you feel disheartened, does it shatter your confidence that your personal approval rating is going down with Australian voters and what more can you do to turn that around? Shorten: No, I don’t. I don’t share the view. Listen, for 2,030 days I’ve lead a united team in the good days and the bad days. I’ve learnt very early on in this job not to comment on the polls. We’re all going to find out in 13 days who wins the election. What I know Australians want is not for us to talk about ourselves, they want us to talk about the people. There’s a real choice at this election. Very simply, vote for real change, end the chaos in Canberra, vote Labor. Question: How do you ensure the states spend the $500m, reducing hospital wait times? Will there be a benchmark or target set? Shorten: Absolutely. We’ll put more money on the table to the states. Just to explain to people who are patients or waiting for elective surgery. What happens is currently Canberra, the national government to whom the lion’s share of taxes are paid, they’re only paying 45% of the key hospital costs. Whereas we think that Canberra, because of its significant, they’re wealthier than the states, should help provide additional and should pay 50%. We’ll sit down and do partnership arrangements with the states. A lot of our announcements are guided by the best advice of state experts right now. Question: Was what former PM Paul Keating wrong then? This is a man who you have said you take great advice from. He’s a man you said you listen to. Is he wrong when he says the security agencies are filled with nutters? Shorten: Yeah. I don’t share that view. I do not share that view. Having said that, I thought some of his other characterisations perhaps were more pertinent. But not on national security. Question: Paul Keating described the nation’s spy chiefs as nutters and said they’re setting the foreign policy for Australia and damaging our relationship with China. Do you share any of those concerns? What would an incoming Labor government do in terms of those leading our security agencies? Shorten: Well, I don’t share those concerns. Paul Keating’s an elder statesman of Australian politics. He’s never been shy of saying what he thinks. But for myself and for my opposition team, we’ve worked very well with the national security agencies. They know that and we know that. And we of course will continue to take the professional advice from the people who help keep Australians safe. The telecast was delayed for the debate, so here we go: Question: $1.25 million in six years’ time which is half the capital costs of building this centre and it’s a good thing for the area, but isn’t there a critical need now in cancer units like this for additional funding? They’re overrun, their demand is high, their ability to deal with the patient load is insufficient – don’t they need a funding injection within six years, like straight away? Bill Shorten: I think you’ve gone to the heart of this election in one question. That’s why Labor’s going to put back $14m into the hospital here. That’s immediate. What we’re going to do with that $14m is help make sure there are more nurses and more doctors. Because of Susan Templeman lobbying, we’re going to make sure that the emergency department at the Hawkesbury hospital can take more people which will lead to less pressure on Nepean hospital. That all happens straight away. It doesn’t just stop there. Elections are about choices. The government chooses to give billions of dollars right now to the top end of town, to welfare for the well off. I choose to spend some of that money instead on providing scans and support for our bulk billing, for visits to the oncologist, right now. Let’s not forget on budget reply night I outlined the most ambitious policy to start funding assistance for cancer treatment right now. These are a very clear choice. Your question goes to the nub of it. There is a crisis now. Only Labor is prioritising putting money on the table to help with the out-of-pocket. When the voters strip away all the ads and the negativity, there’s simple choices. One and two Australians will get a diagnosis of cancer in their life. Out-of-pocket costs are expensive. I was surprised, to be honest, that within 10 minutes the current PM sneered at our cancer proposal and said it’s all free if you go through the public system. No, it’s not. We’re talking to the survivors. It’s not. And they said we couldn’t afford it. Always remember that politics is about choices. When Mr Morrison says he can’t afford to help people in the fight of their now, or he can’t afford to put back the money into Nepean hospital, he made a choice. He chose instead to defend, unsustainable and indefensible subsidies for the top end. From the executive producer of Q&amp;A: Scott Morrison also turned down invitations to appear on Insiders this campaign. He will be on 7.30 tonight. We wrap up with these final messages: Frydenberg: The Coalition has an economic plan to grow the economy and to create 1.25m new jobs over the next five years. And we’re doing that by cutting taxes for over 13 million Australians. By creating more than 80,000 new apprentices. And by spending $100bn on infrastructure in order to get you to work earlier and to get you home sooner and safer. We’re doing all of that while guaranteeing record funding on essential services of schools and hospitals without increasing your taxes. The Labor party are only promising one thing – $387bn of higher taxes. Remember, the more they spend, the more they tax, the more Labor weakens the economy, leading to fewer jobs and lower wages. Bowen: Under a Shorten Labor government the tax system will be fairer. Hospitals and schools will be better funded. Surpluses will be bigger. Emissions will be lower. Josh and I could agree there is a real choice at this election. There’s only one side in this election which is promising a significant increase in health funding, which is promising to boost Medicare, the biggest investment in its history – that’s Labor. There’s only one side promising to lift the human capital of the nation. To lift the horizons of the Australian people through education. Through a $14bn investment. That’s Labor. There’s only one side in this election with a proper plan to increase wages. Not just say we want to increase wages but to deliver increased wages. That’s Labor. There’s only one side of this election proposing $77bn worth of tax cuts for high-income earners, that’s Liberals. There’s only one side that may return to the $80bn worth of tax cuts they said were essential for our future – that’s our opponents. Our team is united and stable and talented. We are to be the government Australia deserves we are ready to be the government Australia deserves. We are ready. That leads to this exchange: Bowen: I do have to pick the treasurer up on the mistruth at the end on tax to GDP and then I’ll turn to John’s question. It’s just not true and you’re just making it up. Frydenberg: What is it at the end of the decade? Bowen: The released Treasury modelling which the Treasury made clear was not their modelling. The tax-to-GDP ratio was written in your office. In your office, not by the Treasury. Frydenberg: What is the tax-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade? Bowen: Same or lower than John Howard during the forward estimates. Frydenberg: End of the decade? Bowen: If you want to accuse John Howard of being a socialist, go ahead. I don’t mind saying Paul Keating is a friend of mine. But if you want to take John Howard to the podium. Tax-to-GDP will be the same or lower than John Howard. With respect to GDP, the government is not proposing no increase. They’re proposing reductions in spending to GDP. The Grattan Institute has modelled. I invite Josh to provide the alternative. $40bn of year worth of cuts to pay for his high income tax cuts. $77bn going to high-income earners. That’s in Josh’s own budget. Question: My question is to both on government spending. Treasurer, your budget assumes there is no increase in new government spending announcements between the next four to 10 years which seems unrealistic. Mr Bowen, you have announced some rather large spending announcements in this campaign that is modest inside four years but blows out to billions of dollars over the decade. Your last time in government Labor built unsustainable spending into the budget in the medium to long term. Frydenberg: We inherited spending growth that is around half of what it is now. It’s the lowest of any government in 50 years but we’ve been able to do that by targeting our spending in a more effective way. Record funding, more than 60% boost to hospitals and to school funding and aged care, disability support. Spending as a proportion of GDP is around 24.6% today. Now it will fall to about 23.6% by the end of the decade. I put that in perspective for you. The Howard government was about 23.1%. Spending is one half of the equation. The other half of the equation is revenue. Now, when you look at tax to GDP, we have been pretty successful in ensuring that stays below a tax to GDP cap. Today it’s 23.3% for 2019-20. Under Labor it goes to 25.9%. They will be the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. By the end of the decade 25.9% is the tax to GDP ratio under Labor. Now it’s no surprise with $387bn of higher taxes. At the end of the day it’s going to suppress economic activity across the board. Take money from retirees, take money from superannuation, take money from homeowners, put up rents, take money from income earners and family businesses, you will suppress economic activity. So the Labor party will increase our tax to GDP ratio to a record amount. Remember, whenever Labor spends more, they tax more. When they tax more, they weaken the Australian economy. Question: Why is neither party proposing to do anything about the high transaction cost of the delivery of Government services which is estimated to cost the budget around $43 billion per year? Frydenberg: We’re always seeking to get value for money for the delivery of Government services. At the end of the day we hope the private sector can also deliver services as well effectively. What we won’t do is spend money on ill-designed policies like we saw from our political opponents. We remember the pink batts and the school halls policies and the cash for clunkers, they were policies that were part of the Labor Party’s time in Government. We have been more focused in how we get money out the door. We will partner with the private sector, where it’s appropriate to do so, but we’re always looking to streamline and create the most efficient services as possible. Bowen: I would refer you to some of the statements and announcements that have been made by Jim Chalmers and Ed Husic about how we would tackle some of these issues. Issues about digital delivery are very valid but botched issues. We have seen spectacular examples of that. If you look at people like Jim and Ed, they are completely focused on better service delivery at the most efficient way possible. I accept the premise of your question, more needs to be done. We have been considering announcing initiatives in that space. Question: Treasurer, you started today’s debate by saying budgets are about more than numbers, they’re about people. Australia’s foreign aid has fallen to an all-time low as a proportion of gross national finance. That means Australia is now one of the least generous countries in the OECD. Given the 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth we hear about and your much hyped and projected surplus next financial year is this domestic retreat a wise financial investment. Shadow treasurer, if you could outline Labor’s policy in terms of foreign aid? Frydenberg: We continue to provide more than $4bn in foreign aid and it is a key part of what we need to do to support our neighbours. What we have done is redirected a lot of our foreign aid to our near neighbours. The money goes to really important causes. Female empowerment, particularly ensuring they can get the money to start a small business, better education and health services. Infrastructure is critical, particularly transport infrastructure so that you can move goods from the farm into the market place. We are doing a lot of things on a number of fronts through our aid program. We’re ensuring that that money is better spent than it has been in the past. Bowen: The Liberal cuts to foreign aid have been extraordinary. Every single budget there has been cuts to foreign aid. I think that is because they don’t need parliamentary approval to do so. Every time their other cuts have been blocked they have said development can cop it in the neck because we don’t need to get that through parliament. That can’t go on anymore. As good corporate or international citizens, it is bad for our geopolitical interests. We have become bad citizens in relation to foreign aid. We have made a commitment to increase foreign aid each and every year we are in office. We don’t pretend we can repair the damage overnight, it will take time to return to 0.5%. We will lay that out in full detail. Foreign aid, overseas development assistance will be better under a Labor government than a Liberal government every single time. That leads to this back and forth: Frydenberg: You’re making a false an analogy between income earners and people who are retirees with shares. What you’re failing to explain is that one is about taxing income and the other is about taxing capital. What is really concerning about Labor’s policy is that it’s going to dampen aspiration and it will make capital formation in this country more difficult. Think about what the Labor party’s proposing. A 50% increase in capital gains tax. Anyone who buys a share will pay an extra 50% in tax as a result of the Labor party. If you’re an investor and there are 58,000 teachers doing that, you go out and buy a property with Labor’s changes to negative gearing, this he will make your life more difficult. Talk about grandfathering. The fact is there will be less investors in the market so even people who are grandfathered will sell into a market with fewer buyers. Bowen: Again, the treasurer seems to think property price reductions under him are fantastic and under us will be terrible. It is telling that the Liberal party likes to talk about tax and they have gone so low as to make up a Labor tax, run an outrageous dishonest scare campaign about a death tax. I’m happy to debate our policies and I will debate them on multiple occasions and Bill Shorten will debate them on Wednesday night if Scott Morrison turns up. Tell the truth, stop making things up and scaring people about an inheritance and death tax because you know it is fundamentally untrue. Frydenberg: As someone sitting in this audience, Andrew Leigh, who wrote an article “Bring back the inheritance tax”. He said it is an efficient form of tax openly. Julia Gillard said there would be no carbon tax and a government she led and then we saw the carbon tax. The public don’t know what your next step is on tax. You have broken 20 years of bipartisanship on the retirees tax. Negative gearing has been a fundamental part of our tax system for decade and you are breaking that. When you were treasurer you said you weren’t going to increase taxes on super. Within 48 hours, you increased them by $9bn and now it is $34bn. This election is about the Labor party increasing peoples’ taxes and the Coalition who are lowering peoples’ taxes. Bowen: We have offered tax relief which is bigger for Australians earning less than $48,000. If you want to talk about election promises, I don’t recall you promising to throw 100,000 people off the aged pension or reduce the aged pension for 300,000 people. I don’t recalls you promising to cut funding to the ABC or SBS or promising to increase taxes by $4bn on working Australians by the Medicare levy which only didn’t happen because of the Labor party. Let’s talk about election promises because you’ve broken more than anybody on this podium. Bowen on that same question: I went through before the things that Josh is defending. Being the only country in the world that does this, providing tax refunds to people who haven’t paid income tax cuts. Inequities compared to people working and receiving a similar income to a retired shareholder. I make this point to the retired shareholders. I respect they have worked and saved hard. I also respect that we need to make decisions to ensure the budget is sustainable and fair going forward. To show them the respect of telling them about our plans before an election. This is the other thing Josh is defending, dividend imputation was introduced by Paul Keating to avoid double taxation. You weren’t taxed on the dividend as well as the company paying tax. By making it refundable, that is not double taxation, that is avoiding any tax. Josh might want to bring back the $80bn worth of tax cuts for big business. Corporate tax rate should not be zero. When you’re refunding every dollar of tax paid to shareholders, the corporate tax rate is zero, whether it is BHP, Telstra, whatever company, society gets a tax take of exactly nothing. Question: This is my question to the treasurer but I’m sure Chris will have a go as well. I was taken by Liberal, by an ad – not in a good way – it was about the elderly couple who were fearing about their franking credits, refunds being taken away. The guy says, “I may have to go on the pension.” I thought should you be embarrassed about that? I know you didn’t create the advert but is that what the Liberal party thinks? It is an embarrassment to go on the pension? To use your own argument about keeping franking credits, these people work all their lives and pay taxes, surely if you need the pension, you need the pension, full stop? Frydenberg: I totally understand why some people need to go on the pension. I also understand that a lot of people are self-funded retirees. These people are the ones the Labor party is targeting. When it comes to the retirees, tax ask the question why has the Labor party conveniently excluded unions and union-backed industry funds from being affected by the retirees’ tax? But they are coming after more than 1 million retirees, including many self-funded retirees. There is a natural inconsistency in the Labor party’s position. The fact is a lot of people rely on these cash refunds in order to maintain their way of life. Some people will be pushed on to the pension. When people go on to the pension, the government needs to fund that. That will be an additional cost to the public purse. The Labor party have also not been absolutely upfront with the Australian people how their retirees tax will affect pensioners. People who were on a self-managed super fund before a certain date in March last year and then became a pensioner after that date will be affected. People who were a pensioner before that date in March last year and get a self-managed super fund after that date will be affected. 50,000 pensioners will be affected and Bill Shorten was pulled up on this during the most recent leaders’ debate. It will affect pensioners, people who will be pushed on to the pension. It ultimately goes against 20 years of bipartisanship on this particular policy and Chris Bowen, in coming after retirees and making them feel like tax cheats, is engaging in a level of class warfare which is not good for society and certainly not good for the economy. They’re both asked to add to those answers: Bowen: I will and then Josh can. It is a time for bigger buffers, for the government to have more levers at its disposal. This election I say it is unusual in that the Labor party when we announce our costings, will show bigger budget surpluses than the Liberals. I accept that is unusual historically but we do so deliberately because we think that with interest rates lower and wages growth anaemic and household debt at international record levels, we need bigger buffers, a bigger insurance policy against uncertain international economic times through bigger budget surpluses. Frydenberg: Don’t look at what Labor says, look at what Labor does. The last time they delivered a budget surplus was 1989 and the Berlin Wall was still standing. Wayne Swan promised four budget surpluses that never eventuated. They were based on heroic assumptions, including $175 iron ore price. Only the Coalition can deliver budget surpluses as we have set out in this year’s budget. The Labor party, bizarrely, is talking about imposing a deficit levy on the one hand and on the other hand talking about budget surpluses. Go figure. Bowen on that same question: Neither a responsible treasurer or shadow treasurer would pre-empt the Reserve Bank movement. That is true. The fact we’re contemplating that interest rates, which are at are still regarded as low levels and almost emergency levels, could be reduced further, it shows the real concern about the economy under this government’s watch. Growth slowing. The forecast downgraded in the budget. Wages growth anaemic and consumption growth at its lowest rate in six years. The fact that the Reserve Bank would contemplate this with inflation at zero, showing there are problems in the economy means the government’s claim to be the better economic managers lie in tatters. Any relief for borrowers is welcome but it is what the Reserve Bank is thinking about the economy which is the telltale sign that Josh claims the fundamentals are sound. Not only is the economy not working for working people, it is not growing as strongly as it should. It is well below potential and trend historically. We can do better with an investment guarantee and new jobs tax cuts, important investments in infrastructure, health and education which would be good for the economy as well as the bigger tax cuts for those who learn less than $48,000. Question: The Reserve Bank, according to financial markets is at shorter odds than Winx to win than to cut rates.What is that saying about the state of the Australian economy? Mr Frydenberg you mentioned the economy may be slowing, we have drought and trade wars going on. Is it the right time to start running substantial surplusses when the Reserve Bank is considering a loosening of monetary policy? Frydenberg: When the most recent inflation numbers came out they showed that child care expenses had fallen by 9%. They showed the electricity prices had come back. When you talk about interest rates, Chris Bowen said, when he was up against Joe Hockey, lower interest rates were good for the economy.These are decisions that are ones for the independent Reserve Bank. We know the cash rate has stayed where it has been since mid-2016, so it has been there for some time. Monetary policy, these decisions are matters for the Reserve Bank of Australia. I wouldn’t seek to pre-empt those decisions that may or may not be taken, other than to say the fundamentals of the Australian economy are sound. Growing at 2.3% in relation to the most recent national accounts. Faster than any G7 nation, except the United States. We are facing head winds, domestically and international. That is why this is not a time to risk the Labor Party, who can’t manage money, who are proposing $387 billion of high taxes, higher taxes on retirees, higher taxes on home owners, higher taxes on renters and on people who want to put additional money, including women after raising a child, into their superannuation as a catch-up contribution. Higher taxes on family business. The Labor Party, doesn’t matter what the question is, the answer is higher taxes. Question to Bowen from that answer: On the point of the review. The issue of false hope being raised with people on Newstart ... Bowen: We are being honest with people. The Liberals say nothing to see here, we think Newstart is fine. We think there are genuine issues. On this issue – I think John Howard has said Newstart is worthy of consideration. We’re not going to make a commitment. It is a complicated issue in relation to how Newstart relates to government payments. I accept the point Josh makes there, how it relates to the minimum wage. These are issues we will work through sensibly as a government. Chris Bowen on that same issue: I wouldn’t be raising dodging questions and refusing to confirm $77bn of high-income tax cuts. On the question of Newstart, there is a choice between the two sides. One side says no issue, no problem, nothing to look at. Won’t change! Our view is there are legitimate issues that do deserve thorough review. I understand people argue we should make a firm commitment to increase the Newstart. We are not doing that. We recognise there are issues which need the resources of a proper government review to examine which is our commitment. In relation to costings, we will release them this week – the earliest any opposition has released its costings in 30 years. The Liberals released their costings on the Thursday before polling day in 2013. Two days before the election. We are releasing them this week, which will be the earliest of any opposition in 30 years. That is because we have a good story to tell and we have done the hard work in relation to policy. The Liberals, while they released their costings in late 2013, they released their budget in 2014 late and they promised no increase in tax at the last election. Our costings will reflect our commitments on research and development and foreign aid. Question: Amidst all the spending promises from both sides, there is no firm commitment due anything about Newstart. I’m wondering why you haven’t been able to make a firm commitment on that, nor government? Why don’t they deserve more at this election? Frydenberg: A couple of points. 99% of people on Newstart are actually on another type of benefit. It might be a parental allowance or another form of support. That’s important. The other thing about Newstart is two-thirds of the people come off within 12 months and go into a job. We have been successful in helping to create the conditions where 1.3 million people have found more jobs, including a majority of women and over the last year, nine out of 10 new jobs that have been created have been full-time. That is significant. Because you raise the issue of Newstart, it is important that Chris answers the question because Bill Shorten has said, during this campaign, Newstart needs to rise. The Labor party are putting out their costings this week. Bill Shorten said in the most recent debate his costings will be “the full box and dice”. Will they include the extra spend on changing Newstart, which Bill Shorten says has to happen, or will your costings dodge that real question? Also you have had Penny Wong say during this campaign you have to lift spending on aid. Will your costings include the additional spending on aid? You have also had Kim Carr saying you want to increase spending on research and development. If Kim Carr is saying that as a shadow minister, will your costings include extra spending on research and development to get to his goal? These are the questions that you have to answer to the Australian people because over half a million people have already voted. They don’t know the true cost of your climate policy and the impact on the economy. You have dodged that question and your leader has dodged that question 68 times. Don’t dodge the question about Newstart, research and development and aid. Chris Bowen then asks: How much for high-income earners? Josh Frydenberg: If you’re talking about what we announced in the budget, it is very clear. $95bn to reduce from 32.5 to 30 cents in the dollar for the tax bracket from $45,00 to $200,000. That will stop bracket creep. What is key about what we have done is what we have focused on is the middle-income earners. There is only one person at this podium who is promising to change the top rate of tax and that’s you, promising to increase it to 49%, what Paul Keating calls too punitive. Bowen: $77bn for high-income earners, right or wrong? Frydenberg: It is a Labor-aligned initiative – the number is $95bn for 32.5 down to 30 cents in the dollar. This is a distraction. The focus in our budget is on ensuring people who are low- and middle-income earners are getting the full benefit of our tax cuts. Under our plan it is very clear the progressive nature of our tax system is not only maintained, it is strengthened. When it is fully rolled out, our tax cuts, you will see the top 5% of taxpayers, which equates to the top rate of marginal tax you’re referring to, end up paying more of the overall tax burden about a third. You can go on about 77bn or 95bn but you know very well when you put down budgets or Labor put down budgets when they were last in office what the Treasury does when it comes to tax is it puts the cost to the budget and we have said it is $95bn. Bowen: Three things. Josh cannot confirm the $77bn figure and he can’t deny it because it is true. He hasn’t ruled out returning to the $80bn worth of company tax cuts if they get a majority in the Senate through their Coalition of chaos. Direct question about cuts. His own budget, which he referred to and PEFO confirmed to pay for the tax cuts, spending to GDP will come down, that’s equivalent to $40bn a year. The Liberals have form when it comes to cutting health and education and they are backing in high-income tax cuts. They will have to be paid for by cuts to health and education if the Liberals win. Josh Frydenberg takes that same question: We have based our tax cuts on the budget forecasts which have been independently reaffirmed just days – a week after the budget in PEFO … We have seen unemployment come down to 5%. When Chris was in government, unemployment was at 5.7%, our biggest state, New South Wales, unemployment has fallen to 4.3%. We have seen investment levels up, particularly in the non-mining sector. The fundamentals of the Australian economy are sound. It will continue to grow strongly. Let’s not forget, when it comes to our tax cuts, not only is Chris Bowen opposing what we announced in this year’s budget, he’s promising to reverse legislated tax cuts from last year’s budget. Question: Mr Bowen, you have announced $157bn in tax reform measures to fund your spending priorities. What will you do if, for example, your dividend imputation changes of around $60bn are not passed through the Senate, are you prepared to curb your spending measures? Likewise to the treasurer, if the budget assumptions are to be overly optimistic, will you scale back your tax cuts? Chris Bowen: We will go, if we win the election, we will go to the Senate, pointing out that we were upfront with our plans, unlike the Liberals who brought down the 2014 budget with all the cuts that it involved without a mandate in clear breach of election promises. We have been announcing these things for six years. We will have a mandate. I don’t argue that that means the Senate must automatically agree. We will treat the Senate with respect but we will point out that is the essential starting point for the passage of our budget through the Senate. Secondly, the Liberals went to the last election with $13bn worth of measures which not only weren’t going to be approved by the Senate had explicitly been rejected by the Senate, the zombie measures which Scott Morrison and I debated on this podium three years ago. They said “we will get them through” and they didn’t. Political parties go to elections without policies, in our case we go and seek a mandate to do these things. The Senate was within its rights to reject the Liberal budgets to cut the pension, aged care payments and cut SBS and ABC and the rest when they had no mandate to do so in 2013. They didn’t seek a mandate to increase the Medicare levy in 2016. They didn’t promise that at the last election. Scott Morrison tried that as treasurer. We have seen the failings of the other side who didn’t have the moral authority of their program. If we win the election, we will have the moral authority of having sought a mandate to do so. Supplementary question: What about the two key points that Josh Frydenberg raised, you’ve underestimated the number of workers in the field, 193,000 and what happens after eight years, you withdraw the subsidy? Chris Bowen: This has been carefully designed, costed with the Parliamentary Budget Office and what’s Josh’s solution, we’re going to keep paying our early childhood educators less than we pay receptionists and checkout operators? With all due respect to them who work very hard, we can’t continue to pay so poorly those with whom we entrust our youngest and those for whom we ask them to nurture their brains for their development. As a country, we have lifted their level of qualifications, demanded and required they lift their level of qualification and we have paid them no extra to do so. It is a big call for the government … but it is the right call. Josh Frydenberg gets a follow-up: The last time the Labor party did it on a $300m scale during the Rudd/Gillard years, there was an independent PWC report that said the policy was all about boosting union membership. That is the real story here. Taxpayers across the country having to fork out $10bn to boost union membership while aged care workers and disability support workers miss out. Every time Labor spends a dollar, it so the back of higher taxes, on the back of retirees and on the back of your higher rents and the back of income tax earners, on the back of family businesses. That is what Labor’s proposing, higher tax. Question to Frydenberg: We are in an era of new economic norms, low inflation and low-wage growth where economic growth seems to turn up in higher corporate profits and more jobs but not necessarily higher wages. With this in mind, could you both pledge to ask Treasury why it seems to have routinely overinflated wage growth in all of its forecasts, rather than adapt to numbers that might be a bit more reflective of this new norm? Frydenberg: We can only go on the best advice of Treasury and you’re right, since 2010, including for Labor budgets, they have had to change their forecast on wages. Chris has got a three-point plan for lifting wages. $387 bn of high taxes won’t do it. Strong arming the Fair Work Commission won’t do it. Ensuring that the tax payer subsidises childcare workers in the private sector, that is Labor’s answer to increasing peoples’ wages. I can tell you that Labor is promising childcare workers a 20% increase over the next eight years. Their numbers of $10bn of taxpayers’ money is modelled on 100,000 childcare workers. I have news for Chris Bowen, there are 193,000 childcare workers. Which childcare workers will miss out from your taxpayers’ subsidy? What will happen in eight years time? Will you remove the government subsidies, the taxpayers’ subsidy for childcare workers, what will happen there? Under Labor the government will be on the hook for decades to come. This will erode our budget, the economic performance of this country. That is the reality of this step with a government under Labor would use taxpayers’ money to fund private sector wages. When Bill Shorten raised this idea he said: “We’re going to start with childcare.” The next day when there was a lot of criticism of this policy he said “That’s it, it is a one-off.” What about people in the aged care space, what about people in disability support services? When will you tell them that you’re not going to do anything for your wages, Chris? $387bn of higher taxes will lead to lower wages, fewer jobs and it will lead to a weaker Australian economy. Bowen responds: It is true that the Liberals have downgraded wages growth forecast in every budget in the economic statement. Let’s go to the issues Josh raises. The Liberals say they want higher wages. Every time they see an idea to deliver it, they’re against that. They say they want higher wages. They don’t have an idea how to deliver it. Firstly, the living wage, there is a choice for Australia. We face a choice. Do we want a working poor? People who go to work every day and work their guts out, often in two or three jobs working in shifts to remain in poverty? The answer, from our point of view, is no. We will give the Fair Work Commission the ability to determine how to avoid a working poor and give them a right to set the living wage and set it in line with employers’ capacity to pay. That restores the Fair Work Commission to the powers they had pre-John Howard. It is saying as a country we won’t have a working poor. Secondly, in relation to penalty rates. This is the first direct wages cut for people since the Great Depression. No tradeoff or increase in the base rate, no enterprise bargaining to get to a more productive outcome, a straight wages cut. After 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, we as a country have to cut peoples’ wages like that in an arbitrary fashion with no impact on employment, no increase in employment? It is wrong. Early childhood educators, our country and our society relies on these people. We delegate our youngest and most vulnerable and ask them to nurture their brains and growth. We pay them $25 an hour. With all due respect, they deserve more than that. Josh, he will wipe his hands and say it is too hard. We could ask childcare centres to pay. Fees will go up. We will tackle this issue and pay our early childhood educators what they deserve. Supplementary question on that last point: “You have just said they need to work closely, what would you like to see, national security within Treasury?” Bowen: No, of course not. The agencies will remain separate. The point I make is of course there are geopolitical challenges in our region and great economic opportunities. We need to bring them together in a discussion about our national strategy to deal with these issues in a sensible, calm methodical way as part of good government. Frydenberg responds: I thought Paul Keating’s comments were an insult to the hard-working men and women of our intelligence and security agencies that have done so much to prevent 15 terrorist attacks in Australia since 2014. If you raise Paul Keating, who is Chris Bowen’s mentor, I have to point out that Paul Keating has been very critical of Labor’s proposal to increase the marginal rate of tax for the top income earners to 49%. He said that is too punitive and has gone on to say Labor has lost the ability to speak aspirationally to people and fashion policies to meet those aspirations. That is Paul Keating, Chris Bowen’s mentor. Question to Chris Bowen: “You’ve made it clear you look to Paul Keating for advice. He has called the heads of our security agencies nutters and suggested they should be cleared out to improve relations with China. Who will you be taking advice from, Paul Keating or our security agencies and does this reflect the views of the New South Wales right? In general?” Bowen: It was quite the outing for Mr Keating with Andrew Probyn yesterday. We could all agree it is great to welcome him to the election campaign. I am sure we will hear more from him. ...We hope we do. I am not sure Josh does. In relation to the specifics, we will work closely with the security agencies and we will take advice from a range of agencies, including Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Attorney General and the security agencies themselves. We will weigh up that advice in the normal, traditional and respectful way and we will work closely with the agencies as you would expect us to do, as Bill Shorten would as prime minister. I think more broadly, we as a country need to tackle this issue head on. The national security establishment and the economic establishment, by which I mean business and people interested in economic growth, need to come together and talk about how we deal with the issues in our region. There is too much shouting at each other in relation to those issues. We will work closely with the intelligence agencies, we will take their advice and weigh it up in line with advice from other government agencies to the National Security Committee as you would expect good the government to do. Chris Bowen responds to Frydenberg’s answer: Scott Morrison argued for $80bn of tax cuts at the last election. The only reason they didn’t become the law of the land is because the Labor party in the Senate wouldn’t agree. If the Liberal party is re-elected and they have a majority through a Coalition of chaos with Clive Palmer and Pauline Hanson in the Senate, they will be back there. No plans is a pretty weak defence for the Treasurer to make. He would not rule out returning to the $80 billion worth of corporate tax cuts. The only reason they’re not the law is they were blocked by the Senate. They will bring them back if they get the opportunity. Our policy is tax relief, conditional on investment, requiring investment, the Australian Investment Guarantee which will reduce the tax on investment down to 26%. We go to the table with that. Josh can’t match that. The new jobs tax cut saying we will work with you if you employ young or older people and people returning to the work force, we will give you a hand. We will work with business to provide tax relief. They want to give away $80bn conditional of absolutely nothing. Sabra Lane points out that is not an answer (on the 10-year point). Frydenberg: We have no plans to change the company tax rates. We tried that and you know what the story is. Question: This time last year your Government’s agenda was cutting the corporate tax rate for all companies. We know what happened and whether compromise was reached. Since then you and the Prime Minister have flatly ruled out revisiting that issue post election in the next term. You have also announced an income tax cut strategy over the next seven years which means you stay under your tax to GDP cap until the end of next decade. Do you have no intention as a Coalition of revisiting corporate tax for at least a decade, given your tax to GDP ratio has been achieved by income tax cuts? Frydenberg: We’re not planning changes on the large companies. As you know we’ve reduced company tax for smaller companies with a turnover of up to $50 million which I note the Labor Party voted against 26 times and only the last minute back flip by Bill Shorten did he actually accept. We know that the best thing we can do for businesses across the economy is to ensure that they have work places where employers and employees are not pitched against each other. The same cannot be said about the Labor Party. They’re proposing and raising the prospect of enterprise bargaining - sorry patterned bargaining and the impact that would have across the economy. Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas has said if that policy would come in, it wouldn’t have allowed the start-up of a company like Jetstar which saw 10,000 employees getting jobs. He also said policies like that would hurt his 38,000 smaller businesses that Qantas supports. The Labor Party is bad for business, big and small, with its industrial relations policies, with also its opposition to free trade agreements which we’ve entered into with some of the major countries in our region, including China, Korea, Japan and the 11 Asian trans Pacific partnership and Indonesia. The overall tax cuts we’re introducing is good for economic activity. The worst thing possible for business is Labor’s $387 billion of high taxes. It will stifle economic activity, it will mean retirees will have less discretionary money to spend, it will send prices of homes down, and discourage superannuation and it will discourage reward for effort and incentive to work harder. Bowen in rebuttal: Josh defended his personal income tax plan which requires the Liberal Party to be re-elected twice. He didn’t reveal how much goes to high income earners. He was asked six times this morning and didn’t reveal and Scott Morrison was asked four times on Saturday and wouldn’t reveal. The answer is $77 billion. If the Prime Minister will accept Bill Shorten’s request for a debate here on Wednesday night he should come with an answer. If they won’t answer the question, the Australian people are entitled to ask why. In relation to negative gearing reform, the IMF, OECD and the Government’s financial systems inquiry, the Grattan Institute, ACOSS and the institute of company directors, Saul Eslake and Jeff Kennett and Joe Hockey have recognised the need for negative gearing reform. Josh may how the housing affordability puzzle has been solved. House prices have fallen under his watch. The Government didn’t model the APRA change to regulation. They can’t have it both ways. Josh is being entirely hypocritical to argue any house price falls under him are great but under the Labor Party would be terrible. Question: You [Frydenberg] say you have an economic plan for a decade, after the tax cuts that deal with bracket creep, there is not much on the plan so I am wondering if there is other tax ideas you’re throwing around? Everyone says we have to do something about land tax and broadening or raising the GST, corporate tax cuts for large businesses, is that something you’d like to revisit if you get into government again? Frydenberg: You raised the state tax which is land tax. In terms of federal tax, what we have focused on is the most significant reform since the Howard government. It is not insignificant to abolish a whole tax bracket, something that Chris and the Labor party oppose. By creating one tax bracket between 45,000 and 200,000, you will have 9 million taxpayers on it, 70% of all taxpayers. By doing that we will tackle bracket creep. The Labor party is against it, which means that an average income earner could be up to $1,000 worse off under Labor than they are under our tax plan. We are all for lower taxes because ultimately it is the people’s money. There is one tax that Chris would find it very hard to defend and I think that is the housing tax. When Chris came up with the housing tax, the housing prices were actually – the housing market was very different than it was today. Houses were going up. Now housing prices have come down. We have seen from the international credit rating agencies the concern that they have and the warnings they have issued about a sharp downturn in the housing market and the impact that will have on household consumption. Household consumption is about 60% of GDP. You have seen SQM research saying the Labor party’s policies could put up rents by as much as 22% and see housing prices fall by 16%. It has come at the wrong time for the housing market. It will potentially have massive impacts on the real economy and it is just another desperate cash grab from the Labor party. Chris Bowen responds: Let’s deal head-on in relation to dividend imputation refundability. The government is defending the current situation, being the only country in the world that provides tax refunds to people who haven’t paid income tax. Spending $6bn a year now, growing to $8bn in the foreseeable future which is more than we spend on public schools at a commonwealth level, three times what we spend on the Australian federal police. Josh is defending that and also an inherent unfairness. If you take the examples, example of somebody in the workforce earning around $67,000 and paying around $13,000 a year in tax. For a retiree through a self-managed super fund, earning $67,000 in detective depends and paying no tax but receiving a tax cheque for $27,000. I don’t think that is fair. I don’t think that is OK. We are seeking a mandate to change that. Josh didn’t seek a mandate, the Liberal party didn’t seek a mandate when they threw 100,000 people off the aged pension off reduced that. We have an approach, the courage to seek a mandate. And the questions begin. First one is to Josh Frydenberg: Question: Labor has been the first opposition since John Hewson’s in 1993 to explicitly outline a large package of reform to taxation. You’ve talked about the dangers of Labor. If Labor wins, will the Liberal party acknowledge that the party has a mandate to carry out those policies? Frydenberg: The first thing is we’re going to win the election, Sabra. I’m not entertaining anything other than that. We believe that fundamentally these taxes will weaken the Australian economy and that’s at heart of this election debate. Take the retirees tax. The retirees tax is based on two decades of bipartisanship. The Labor Party took that proposal for cash refunds to the 1998 election, saying it would help lower income earners and retirees. Over 80% of people who are relying on their cash refunds have a taxable income under $37,000. And pensioners will be hit by Labor’s retirees tax. Labor, in a desperate cash grab and in a game of class warfare, has made these people, over a million of them who are retire across the economy, and the society, feel like tax cheats. By changing those rules, they are going to hurt the economy, particularly capital formation in our economy and the ability to attract investment in Australian stocks. Chris Bowen: The Ngunnawal and Ngambri people care for this land for thousands of years and acknowledging their elders past and present any economic debate should recognise right upfront that we have a long way to go in eradicating Indigenous disadvantage in our country. Good economic policy should be put to work to eradicate that disadvantage. I also want to acknowledge the treasurer, Josh and I obviously have some enormous differences of opinion and policy but I do recognise what a tough job being treasurer of Australia is, not only for Josh but for his family. I put that on record and thank you for your service to our country. Josh is the third Liberal party treasury spokesperson I’ve faced in three elections. I have stood here and debated Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison and now Josh. Josh will talk of a steady hand on the economy. The fact of the matter is there has been no steady hand. The fact is that if the conservatives are elected, there is no guarantee that they won’t learn the lessons and change their habits and that Josh will still be here in three years time to debate again. That is their track record. At the last election, the Liberals at least promised stable government. This time they’re not even bothering. By their very actions, by the preference pact with Clive Palmer and Pauline Hanson, they are guaranteeing if they are re-elected, instability and chaos with all the wackiness that that involves. All the instability and the chaos is not the action of a party serious about economic stability and leadership. The cost of the chaos of the last six years has been very real. Josh likes to trumpet how well the economy is going. He did it just then. Every time he does, he underlines how out of touch this government is. The economy isn’t working for working people. Wages growth at record lows, penalty rates being cut. 1.1 million Australians underemployed. Nearly 1.8 million Australians wanting more work. Households stretching their budgets with rates falling and household debt at record levels. Sluggish economic growth with the IMF predicting economic growth will fall to just 2.1% this year. Josh makes much of the budget surplus. ... This is a government that spent six years fighting amongst themselves, arguing about who should do the prime minister’s job, not to create more and better jobs. I’m happy to be debating Josh here today. I make this prediction, we will spend the next hour, both of us, talking more about Labor policies than Liberal policies because we come to the table with a lot. Josh comes to the table with not very many at all. No policies because they have no vision. No big-picture view of what this country should look like for the generations to come. No framework with which to tackle the challenges and opportunities for our country. Today’s Liberal party knows what it is against, it has very little idea of what it is for. Josh Frydenberg and Chris Bowen are facing off at the National Press Club. Frydenberg is going first: Those plans to cut taxes, to boost infrastructure spending and to create new apprenticeships is all about growing the economy. We’re also ensuring that there is a social dividend and that’s the third part of our budget, record spending on schools and hospitals and aged care and childcare and disability support, ensuring the NDIS is fully funded in this budget, which it is. As well as respite for our carers. A budget is not a trophy for the shelf, it is about what it does for people. Ladies and gentlemen, we have done all of that, started to repair the budget, with a budget surplus, growing the economy and ensuring essential services are guaranteed all without increasing taxes. Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen can’t make the same claim because they are proposing $387bn of high taxes on the Australian people. When you get up in the morning and go to work they will tax you, when you put money into super they will hit you with extra tax, when you buy an investment property or buy a share they will increase the taxes on you and if you’re a family business, they will increase the taxes there. You see, the Labor party just wants to redistribute the pie. We want to grow the pie. We want all Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. That’s the clear choice at this election. A Coalition which is delivering a strong economy, preparing for the international and domestic economic headwinds, guaranteeing the essential services with record funding for schools and hospitals and aged care and disability support, all without increasing taxes. The thing you need to know about Bill Shorten and the Labor party is every time he promises more spending, it’s coming at the expense of higher taxes. He’ll promise more spending, he’ll tax you more and, as a result, he will weaken the Australian economy, creating fewer jobs and lower wages. That’s the choice for the Australian people at the forthcoming election. The questions continued: Question: Why won’t you release the work that the government’s done? McCormack: Well, fact is, we’ve got an economic plan for this country, and the fact is, we’ve been very transparent about what we’re doing, and how we’re doing it. We’re meeting our international climate arrangements. We’re making sure that we reduce emissions in a responsible way, meeting our Kyoto targets, meeting the targets that we set, and the world’s set. We’ve signed up to them, we’re agreeing to them. What we also want to do is make sure that when pensioners need to be able, and families and businesses flick the switch on, that power comes on. What we want to make sure is that’s done in an affordable way, and what we want to do is make sure that if you’re an aluminium smelter, or a cement maker, in Gladstone, Bundaberg, or anywhere else. The fact that you can have more affordable power, that’s the Coalition way. That’s the Liberal National’s way. That’s the Keith Pitt way. We want to make sure that there’s affordable power, and we also want to make sure that agriculture and that industry is its best self, and that’s why investments such as the $750,000 for the pre-feasibility study in the Port of Bundaberg, that’s why those sorts of infrastructure and business case and announcements and arrangements, are so important. Question: Why are we holding another set of modelling by Cadence economics? Do you not like the findings? McCormack: Well, the fact is we’ve been very transparent, and the fact remains that the only person who isn’t being transparent about their policies and their costings, are Shifty Bill Shorten. Now, I know he’s going to have his campaign launched in Brisbane today. Fact is, he’s actually, probably on his feet as I speak. Now, how many times in that campaign launch, that Bill Shorten’s doing today, will he use the F word? A four letter F word. Farm. How many times will he talk about regional Australia? How many times will he come and make a sentence, say a sentence about how much his economic policies are going to cost, and how much his climate change announcements are going to cost the economy, and the average person in the street? He won’t do that. He won’t do that, because he knows he can’t do that, because if he does, fact is, nobody will vote Labor. They’ll understand that the future looks very bleak under a Bill Shorten-led government. Michael McCormack has Michael McCormacked his way through a ‘show us your modelling’ exchange with reporters in Bundaberg while campaigning with Keith Pitt: Question: Brian Fisher says the Coalition has not acted transparently over secret modelling commissioned on the cost of climate action. And that even he hasn’t seen the findings. Why won’t you release the work? McCormack: Well, why won’t Bill Shorten, Shifty Bill Shorten release his cost to the economy of 45% emissions reduction? Why won’t Shifty Bill Shorten release the findings and his economic plan of what’s it’s going to cost for 50% renewables? It is going to de-industrialise Australia. It is going to force farmers to de-stock. That’s the Shifty Bill Shorten way. We want to make sure that farmers can realise their potential. We want to make sure that the $60 billion dollar agriculture sector grows to a hundred billion dollars. Bill Shorten, wants to tell farmers what they can farm, where they can farm, how they can farm, why they can farm, and the future for farmers, which is going to be bleak under a Bill Shorten-led government. The fact is, Bill Shorten also wants to make sure there’s a Just Transition Authority in Queensland to tell the people in the primary industry sector, particularly in the mining sector, that they can’t have a job, that they need to turn into baristas. Well, we know that coal mining for instance, employs 55,000 people. We know that coal mining helps to produce 66% or two-thirds of our energy needs, and we know that coal mining produces $66 billion dollars of exports. So $66 billion dollars that state governments are able to spend on state health and state public schools. We know that we’re behind the resources sector. Bill Shorten isn’t. He wants to transition. Transition all those mining workers into coffee makers. Well, we can’t all be coffee makers. We can’t all be people who are just layabouts, or don’t have a job. Scott Morrison ends the press conference by again explaining just what an election is, just in case voters are confused as to what is happening on May 18 and why they are being bombarded with election advertising: I believe the choice at this election will be made by all of the Australian people. That is who will make this choice. The choice is very straight forward, it is a choice between whether you want me as prime minister or you want Bill Shorten. Whether you want to have a government that knows how to manage money so they won’t come after yours which is what will happen under Labor. Whether you want a government that will lower taxes for families and small businesses and a Labor party that is going to increase the tax burden at the worst possible time for our economy which puts jobs at risk by $387bn? Whether you want a government that is investing in the hospitals and schools and roads, whether it is here on the south coast or elsewhere around the country, increasing that investment responsibly by managing the budget well? Finally, a government that knows how to keep Australians safe, whether it is from online bullying , or backing our security agencies like say Asio and others who have prevented 15 terrorist attacks here in Australia. We’re happy to claim them and they’re the heroes of keeping Australians safe. There is a clear choice. We have a plan to ensure that Australians can continue to go forward by building our economy and securing our future, whether here on the south coast with Warren or right across the country. Question: The leaders debate in Canberra.We learned it will be in Canberra on Wednesday night. Are you finally going to take off the gloves? Morrison: I look forward to the next debate.It will be the third. With he were happy to do it. I’m glad the Leader of the Opposition finally agreed to do just that. Mundine: As a Mundine, I will give you a training on the boxing. Morrison: It will be another opportunity forBill Shorten to explain who is paying the price of his policies. Question: You need to win this one, don’t you? Morrison: It is another debate. I’m happy to have any debate. The Australian people will make that judgement. Question: Prime minister, will the Coalition be matching the Labor party’s commitment to upgrading the hospital, the $34m for mental health for mental health outpatient clinic? Morrison: Well, later today, we are making announcement about the Shellharbour hospital and we’re pleased to be making those announcements and investing in our local health. We have made announcements about increasing funding for local roads and the big one was when I was last down here on the Princess Highway. I have driven the roads and I know how dangerous they were and you were asking questions the last time we were here and I know how important a priority that is. We have increased funding for public hospitals across the country by more than 60% and our arrangement with the NSW government will see that further increase over the next five-and-a-half years. Mundine: We are working closely with our state coalition partners. Like what we did with the road and your newspaper, the South Coast Register, has been at the forefront of that project for the road. We sat down with the Treasury and we went through step by step, section by section what it was going to cost and how much money that the federal government needed to pay. This is what we will be doing with our hospital services here. We’re sitting down with the state government here. Question: How will it affect people earning more than $100,000? Morrison: I can tell you. We haven’t changed anything for those earning on the top tax rate. On the top tax rate will be returning 36% of the income tax revenue. They will be paying 36% of total income tax revenue. What they pay today is 31%. You see the thing we were deferring to do that under our tax plan, which is a 7 year plan which is giving tax relief to those who need it urgently now and extending the rev to middle income earners and ensuring that 94% of Australians will not pay a tax rate marginally higher than 30 cents in the dollar. The idea of bracket creep and the experience of bracket creep will be eliminated. That’s what our plan does. We wanted to make sure when we did that, it wouldn’t harm our income tax system. We looked at carefully what share of the total income tax take would be paid by those on the highest marginal tax rate and the answer to that question is it increases from 31% to 36%. So, I think that’s a pretty detailed understanding of what’s going on. Except that is not true. The budget papers show that they will get an $11,000 tax cut from 2024. It’s from the tranche that Labor and the Greens won’t support Question: Can you tell us what is the problem with releasing a detailed costing of that policy? (high income tax cuts) Morrison: No, no, we did. There are three components to the income tax policy we released into the budget. There is the increase in the threshold from41,000 to 45,000 under the tax plan and that’s about $46 billion and there is the cost of reducing the 32cent rate for people earning between$45,000 and $200,000 and that’s $95million. Question: Will will you not publicly release the findings into an the inquiry into bullying allegations into Ken Wyatt? Morrison: There are privacy issues relating to the individuals and that’s the normal practise. (That answer did not cut it for the government when Emma Husar was under investigation) He continues: Now, on the other matter you asked me about, the difference between our emissions reduction policy and Labor’s emissions reduction policy is Labor’s will require by their own admission companies like those on the South Coast to have to go and write cheques out to foreign carbon traders for foreign carbon credits. Now, our emissions reduction has been achieved on the fund that we have been running at about 11 to $12. Those foreign carbon credits is around 42. So our policy is achieving lowest cost abatement, that’s how the policy is intended to work. When you have a target that requires 1.3 billion tonnes to be reduced then they have to engaged in the other measures. Bill Shorten said last Friday that it wouldn’t cost the economy anything. He is not telling you the truth. You have got to tell them the price Bill and tell them who you are going to make pay for it. It is going to be mums and dads and retirees and small business owners and people trying to buy houses. That’s who is getting hit with all of these taxes. Question: What’s your reaction to the US threat to put more tariffs on China overnight and also can I also ask you about back to your comments about international carbon credits? Brian Fisher recommended that the ALP and the Coalition use these credits. What’s your reaction? Morrison:The trade tensions between the United States and China present a great risk to the regional economy and of course, to the Australian economy. That’s always been the case. That’s why I think the Labor Party’s plans of engaging in an enormous economic experiment of reckless spending, I mean spending out of control, supporting by the highest taxes we have seen, equals big risk. Big spending, big taxes, equals big risk and our economy is facing some challenging times in the years ahead and so now is not the time, certainly not the time, to be engaging in those big policy experiments. I said yesterday when I saw the former Labor Prime Ministers at their launch yesterday, what it reminded me of was Labor’s inability to implement the big spending programs. You see, it is not just what Labor says they will cost. It’s what they will cost after they’ve stuffed them up because they always stuff these things up. These projects are so big. The spending is so large and they end up costing so much more and guess who they will be going back to get that money from? You. It won just be retirees either and retirees here, 8. 8,500 of them. I heard Bill Shorten was on radio this morning denying he could be costing retirees. I mean, what does he think? That he can spend all this money and it is for free and no one will have to pay the price. I think the Australian people are working him out. This is a guy running around and saying everything is free and no one has to pay for it. What you do in government, you have sensible, responsible spending that increases funding for hospitals and schools like we have by more than 60% over the last five-and-a-half years that invests more in age care and that is going to take our National Disability Insurance Scheme from 30,000 up to 280,000 clients and it will go to well over 450,000 and you do that by responsible spending, careful budget management, not engaging in all these risky experiments. Question: But with respect, with respect, you did comment, you did make comments with regards to the Bahrainian soccer player. How is this matter different? Morrison: All diplomatic matters require bespoke approaches. That’s how you manage those very sensitive issues and that’s what I will do. Question: Prime Minister, you say you will try anything to get more young people into work. The Labor opposition proposed tax incentives for companies that employ young and older workers. What about that plan and what do you make of it? Morrison: It is a watered down version of the plan they took to the last election. Labor are cutting back on the suggested assistance they were going to provide, but compared to what they’re going to take those same businesses, I mean it complete overwhelms the measure. I don’t think Labor can get their lines straight. On one hand, they want to tax the businesses out of business and so, a business that’s been put out of business by Labor’s tax policies can’t help anyone. Question: Prime Minister two questions. Paul Keating called the heads of security agency, nutters. Can I take you to someone who has been held in China without access to lawyers. Can you tell us if that’s acceptable and give us detail what you’re doing about that? Morrison: On the first matter, our security agencies have prevented 15 terrorist attacks in Australia. So, for what the Labor Party calls a Labor legend to go out there and attack the credibility of our security agencies that have been saving lives in this country, I think is disappointing. I think that should be disowned and I think the leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten, should behaving something to say about that in denouncing what Paul Keating had to say. The other thing is that when he is providing that denunciation, he should tell us who is going to be the home affairs minister if he is elected that will actually have responsibility for the security agencies? Because it is less than 2 weeks to go until the election and we still don’t know who a Labor home affairs minister would be. Now, given that national security is the first responsibility of any national government, I think it is only fair that not only does Australians know that what the prices they will have to pay for a Shorten government, but they should know who is actually going to be in charge as a minister for national security in a Shorten government and they haven’t answered that. On the other matter you have raised, we continue to work with the Chinese government on all these related matters in terms of any individuals. It a complex matter and the advice is the best assistance and the best support we can provide is to not engage in a public commentary on this matter and work carefully through the diplomatic channels that we have.? Question: Warren Mundine accused you of being a dodgy politician and he said he hated John Howard. Is he really the best man to represent the Liberal party in this seat? Scott Morrison: The reason I was enthusiastic for Warren to be our candidate and we have known each other for sometime because Warren represents so much of what the honest, decent aspirations of what Australians is all about. Someone who has come from, you know, a background that has enabled him to work hard, get ahead. His kids are involved in running their own businesses. This is what we’re on about. So, with someone like Warren you can see what we’re on about as the Liberal Party. He worked out that the Liberal party were full of hot air when it came to supporting workers. They were full of hot air when it came to growing the economy and he saw through all of that. The reason he joined us is because of the policies that help businesses and regions. When Warren and I started talking about this, he didn’t say, “Look, I would like to run for somewhere which is a safe seat.” No, Warren wanted to run in a regional seat and he wanted to be fully engaged in this election because he believes what we believe. I think his family is a great example of that. The story that I recall in what Warren and I have had in our many conversations is when his grandfather got a job, their family changed and that’s... Warren Mundine: Not a [fancy] job too. It was a cattle station. Morrison: Getting a job and understanding that getting a job is what turns things around intergenerationly. Last year, under our government, more than 100,000 jobs were created for young people. That’s the highest rate of job growth that Australia has ever seen. Of all the things I’m pleased about that we have been able to accomplish over the last five-and-a-half years and points to what we will accomplish in the future, has been getting young people into work. If you get a young person into work, it changes their life. It changes their community. It changes their family. I could not be more passionate about getting young people into work and I will try everything and we have and it has been That’s why I can say that of the 1. 25m jobs, one in five of those jobs will be created for young people. 250,000 more businesses out there creating those jobs. That’s what our economic plan is going to deliver over the next five years and that’s what I think is a great plan for the south coast of NSW. Morrison continues. The Coalition’s message has narrowed down to this, for the last two weeks: We have seen a lot of change happen in the Australian economy and there is more change that will come to the Australian economy in the years ahead. Not only what happens with the globalisation of the economy, but the risks that are there in terms of the trade tensions between China and the United States. There is a lot of change that will occur over the next few years and that’s why we believe as a government, it is very important that we maintain that stable economic management. That we don’t engage in the big risky programs of big spending and big taxes. $387bn of higher taxes that will weigh down this economy. Our economy can’t afford to go into the future and the uncertainty that is out there with those sorts of penalties and without those sorts of disadvantages and that’s why economic management today is more important than ever. That’s why financial management and budget management is more important than ever because the road ahead for this business, for this community, depends on keeping our economy strong. Managing our economy. Managing our finances because if you can’t manage money, you always end up spending more and you always have to ask someone else to pay for it and with the Labor party that’s always you. They will always come after you for more money when they run out of money and they can’t manage money. Scott Morrison starts off his press conference by once again explaining what an election is: And so, where we’re standing today is really important. It is important because here in the seat of Gilmore, they will not only decide who their next member of Gilmore will be and we want to see Warren [Mundine] as the Liberal candidate elected as the local Liberal member here for Gilmore who will do an outstanding job. But it is one of the key seats around the country where the people of Gilmore, the people on the south coast, will get to decide who the next prime minister should be. Whether I should continue in that job as prime minister or whether Bill Shorten should become prime minister. So, it will be a key choice for the people of the south coast about who they want to lead this country for the next three years and so, it is a big choice here in Gilmore and that’s obviously one of the many reasons why we’re here.” Glad we have cleared that up. Scott Morrison is first off the press conference ranks today. He is making the government’s $160m manufacturing announcement. Clive Palmer wants to change how we learn about election results – basically just for the United Australia party Western Australian Senate candidate. From Australian Associated Press: The high court is set to hear a bid by businessman Clive Palmer to ban the Australian Electoral Commission publishing data, including two-candidate preferred counts, until booths close countrywide on election day. The two candidates listed are almost inevitably Liberal-Nationals or Labor and not candidates from minor parties or independents. Palmer, who is contesting a Senate seat for Queensland and running a team of United Australia party candidates, wants the court to prevent the AEC publishing data until 9.30pm (AEST), after polls in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have also closed. He says the current process gives the appearance of the AEC, an independent umpire, favouring major-party candidates and could misinform voters about the true state of the count. The hearing is set down for 2.15pm AEST in Canberra. As we reported yesterday, the final leaders’ debate is all but locked in for Wednesday 8 May at the National Press Club. Labor had suggested a panel of journalists, with representatives from the networks who didn’t get a debate (ABC and Nine, mostly) but it looks like it is going back to a single moderator – Press Club president, Sabra Lane. With the caveat that single-seat polls are notoriously all over the place, Advance Australia (conservative GetUp) have conducted a poll showing Zali Steggall is ahead of Tony Abbott, 51 to 49. That follows a GetUp (original GetUp) poll the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age published on the weekend, showing Steggall was ahead 56-44 (see what I mean about single-seat polls?). Steggall faces a massive uphill battle, so I would not say it is a lock. At all. But Gerard Benedet, the head of Advance Australia, puts the poll down to the “sophisticated deception” of GetUp’s campaign. From his statement: GetUp couldn’t beat Tony Abbott by honestly backing Labor, they couldn’t beat him by honestly backing the Greens, and they couldn’t beat him by honestly backing a lefty independent,” Benedet said. “So, what have they done? They have learned from their mistakes and are now backing the pretend Liberal in Zali Steggall.” Labor’s vote has crashed to just 8% in Warringah, an electorate where they once polled (2007) 27.4% of the vote and at the last election 14.79% of the primary vote. It’s a fall of 59% since the last election. The Greens vote has also crashed from 12% in the 2016 election to 4% in the poll conducted on Thursday night. The point of releasing the poll seems to be to convince anyone planning a protest vote to not do that. Sort of a “scare them straight” strategy: Revealingly, the poll also revealed that 51% of voters believe that Tony Abbott will win the election. “Clearly, if the people of Warringah don’t want a Shorten Labor government there is no room for a protest vote. The way Warringah goes, so goes the nation and this poll is definitive proof,” said Mr Benedet. Peter Dutton very, very quickly hit the keyboard yesterday when he heard Paul Keating’s comments to the ABC that the “nutters” were in charge of Australia’s security agencies: Bill Shorten must urgently explain whether he agrees with Paul Keating that Australia’s security agencies have lost their strategic bearing and whether Australia’s security agencies would indeed be headed for a full-scale “cleanout” under a Shorten Labor government. Given Mr Shorten made repeated references to the advice he and his colleagues receive from Mr Keating, Australians have every right to be concerned that Labor would unpick Australia’s successful national security apparatus – a security network which has disrupted 15 major terrorist attack plots since September 2014. Mr Shorten must immediately reveal whether he has had any personal discussions with Mr Keating on this matter and whether Mr Keating has expressed those same views during those meetings. This was Keating’s advice in that interview he gave yesterday: “When the security agencies are running foreign policy, the nutters are in charge. You’d clean them out. You’d clean them out.” Tanya Plibersek earlier this morning said Labor under Bill Shorten wasn’t taking its cues from Keating on national security: “People love Paul Keating for his colourful language and that was on display yesterday but we have a very good relationship with Australia’s national security agencies. We receive regular briefings, I do, Bill does, the shadow national security committee does,” she said. But she did agree with him on China being an “absolutely vital economic partner” and “we have to have a good relationship with China”. “It’s important for any government or potential government to heed the information we get from our security agencies and we take it very seriously and we don’t comment on it publicly,” she added. Interventions by former leaders aren’t always helpful – see John Howard’s character reference for George Pell following his conviction. This story from Latika Bourke at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age over issues in Ken Wyatt’s office is bubbling along. A secret inquiry into bullying claims in the office of the aged care minister Ken Wyatt has heard of staff being “scared” to work with an advisor who claimed to have a “special relationship” with the senior government frontbencher. The minister has refused to release the findings of the inquiry – ordered by the then chief-of-staff to Malcolm Turnbull – prompting whistleblowers to reveal details of what they say was a toxic work culture “enabled” by Mr Wyatt. You can read the whole story here Hasluck is very much in play. Labor plans on pushing this today, given Scott Morrison’s comments last week, in the midst of the candidate chaos, about addressing these issues. Plus, there was the government attack during the Emma Husar investigation about what Labor was hiding. Pre-poll still stands (at most recent count) at 660,000 in just five days. That is more than double the same time at the last election. Bill Shorten was on Sunrise this morning, also talking polls, and why Scott Morrison is still preferred prime minister: I don’t accept that people don’t like me or our policies. But I’ve made a rule for over 2,000 days while I’ve led a stable and united Labor party that I am not going to comment about polls. I’ve only got another 13 days to go so I’m not about to break that now. But I think when you look at the key issues in the election David, the issue is do you want more of the same or is it time for real change? Do we want more chaos, more cuts to services or do we want to see real action on wages, cost of living and of course climate change by a united team? Josh Frydenberg and Chris Bowen will debate all things treasury and economy today, at the National Press Club, which of course, we will be bringing you. This of course, comes ahead of the RBA’s May meeting, where speculation is high it will cut interest rates. The RBA has only changed rates during an election campaign twice, Jessica Irvine at the Sydney Morning Herald wrote a little bit ago – in 2007 and 2013. Both times, the government lost the election. Kieran Gilbert attempted to get an answer out of Josh Frydenberg on Sky News this morning over how much the Coalition’s high-income tax cuts would cost. Frydenberg said the only people who have put a figure on it were the “Labor-aligned” Australia Institute, which he does not find “credible”. But he still won’t put a number on it himself. Scott Morrison is the guest on 7.30 tonight. Bill Shorten is the solo guest on the bad show, also tonight. Tanya Plibersek, who is filling much the same role for Labor, also had some thoughts on polls: Polls are interesting, but, really, as we always say, the only one that counts is the big poll on the day. It has tightened, you are quite right. We have to never take this for granted. We haven’t for a single day. We have been disciplined. We have been focused on the policies that will really give everyone in this country a fair go and we have got the call out the scare campaigns. How much more negative Scott Morrison will get in this campaign. It has been very negative from them for the moment. All you have got is Scott Morrison saying, “We can’t afford it, we can’t afford it.” What he means when he says that is, “You don’t deserve it. You don’t deserve pensioner dental or to properly fund the NDIS, you don’t deserve fee relief on your childcare.” On the polls, Simon Birmingham, who has filled the role of Coalition spokesman this election campaign, had this to say: I think what you can see is a continuing tightening, a very close contest, and a close contest that means every viewer should know that their vote is going to matter, their vote is going to count and they should think long and hard about them, their children, their grandchildren’s future and if they want a future where they can have greater confidence of getting a job, of getting ahead of not being burdened by higher taxes, of not finding their retirement savings raided, then they should absolutely be backing Scott Morrison, who has outlined a strong plan to be able to keep our economy growing and create those opportunities. Oh good. Clive Palmer is really excited about nuclear power (he wants to put a reactor in South Australia) so that’s the new topic he’s decided to awkwardly talk about in front of a camera. There is no excuse for this. None. While Labor is demanding the government outline the cost of its high-income tax cuts (the Australia Institute put it at $77bn, which the government rejected) the Coalition is demanding Labor say who would be home affairs minister in a Bill Shorten government. Shayne Neumann holds the comparable position of shadow minister for immigration and border security but Labor is yet to say whether or not it would keep the giant home affairs department. Speaking to RN, Tanya Plibersek said “We’re not going to announce a ministerial line-up before we win an election.” Except a lot of positions are known. Most of them, actually. Home affairs is a tricky one, because it is more than just a decision on who gets it, it’s also a decision on whether it keeps the super-ministry. In case you missed it yesterday, here is the moment Paul Keating hijacked the ABC Labor launch live broadcast: It’s a bit of a slow day in the campaign this morning. Labor will talk more about the health policy it announced yesterday $250m to improve and upgrade hospital emergency departments and cut waiting lists. The Liberals will be talking manufacturing: Building on our vigorous free trade and export agenda, the Morrison Government will reinvigorate the ‘Australian Made’ campaign with up to $5 million to promote the logo in Australia’s key export markets and establish new trademarks in markets like the European Union, UK and Canada. The Coalition will also create a Manufacturing Modernisation Fund that will stimulate at least $160 million worth of business investment in new technologies and processes so manufacturers can grow and employ even more people. Scott Morrison is chatting to that great Australian battler, Alan Jones, and again, uses his footballer riding Winx analogy to describe Labor’s tax plan. Congratulations if you had “politician talks about racehorse and football non-stop to appear relatable” on your campaign 2019 bingo card. Welcome to the back end of the campaign, with just 12 days to go until the polls close. Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten have both started the day in Sydney. The southern states are going to get a lot of love these next few days. There are seats to be won for both sides in NSW and Victoria, which, with Queensland and WA appearing more of a gamble, has the major parties trying to batten down familiar ground. Labor officially launched its campaign on Sunday. It will put out its costings at the end of this week, which is earlier than usual – normally we don’t get that until the last week. So far, Morrison has pointed to the budget as the Coailtion’s costings but the calls are getting louder for the Liberal party to release how much its tax cuts for high income earners will cost. Let the costings war begin. The Liberal party have set down their launch for next Sunday (Mother’s Day) in Melbourne, which shows you how important Victoria has become to its campaign. We are officially in the serious section of campaigning. Shiz is getting real. Newspoll and Ipsos polls were both published overnight, with not a lot of movement. As AAP reports: Two polls published on Sunday night suggest that the federal election is tightening, although both continued to show Labor ahead, with any movement inside the margin for error. The Ipsos poll published in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on Sunday night had Labor ahead 52-48, a one-point drop from the result a month earlier. Newspoll, also released late on Sunday and published in the Australian, put the figures the same as a week ago, at 51-49 to Labor, but with a one-point fall in its primary vote to 36%. A lot can happen in 12 days though. This is after all, politics in Australia. So I hope you have had your coffee. I need to find mine. But in the meantime – let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/06/iranian-nuclear-centre-iaea-inspectors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-06T12:25:42Z","webTitle":"Iranian nuclear R&D centre 'visited by UN inspectors'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/06/iranian-nuclear-centre-iaea-inspectors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/06/iranian-nuclear-centre-iaea-inspectors","fields":{"headline":"Iranian nuclear R&D centre 'visited by UN inspectors'","bodyText":"UN inspectors have gained rare access to an Iranian nuclear facility, giving them a \"better understanding\" of Tehran's disputed programme, it has been reported. They observed a plant where centrifuges for enriching uranium were developed as part of a transparency deal but acknowledged that Iran remains resistant to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation. According to a confidential IAEA report obtained by Reuters, inspectors visited a research and development centre for centrifuges on 30 August. It gave neither details nor the location of the site. But such access could be crucial to helping the agency determine how far along Iran might be in developing more modern models of the machines. Iran's efforts to replace the breakdown-prone, 1970s vintage IR-1 centrifuge it is now operating at its Natanz and Fordow enrichment plants are closely watched by the west since success could lead to more efficient equipment enabling the country to amass material that could be used for atomic bombs more quickly. Iran says it is refining uranium to fuel a planned network of nuclear power plants. If enriched to a high concentration of the fissile U-235 isotope, uranium can also be turned into the explosive core of an atomic bomb. \"It is of importance to see the R&amp;D to understand the full scope and status of the programme,\" former IAEA chief inspector Olli Heinonen, now at Harvard University's Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs, told Reuters. Apart from an R&amp;D centrifuge plant at Natanz to which the IAEA already has regular access, Iran has a facility called Kalaye Electric in Tehran that the UN agency has seldom visited. Heinonen said R&amp;D work was also done at other locations. It is not clear when the IAEA was last able to examine an R&amp;D site but such visits are believed to be rare. One was made in 2011 and another in 2008, though it is not known whether they were to Kalaye or some other location. Iran denies allegations its enrichment programme is part of a covert bid to develop the capability to make nuclear weapons, but western states have imposed economic sanctions to make it scale back its atomic activities. Friday's IAEA report, which has not yet been made public, said Iran missed a deadline on 25 August to address suspicions about activities in the past that could be relevant to any attempt to assemble nuclear bombs. It said Iran had implemented just three of five nuclear transparency steps that it had agreed to carry out by last month's target date. The two measures it had failed to implement concerned providing information about alleged research that is part of the IAEA's long-running investigation into what it calls the \"possible military dimensions\" of Iran's nuclear programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/11/green-groups-welcome-amber-rudd-climate-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-11T12:48:11Z","webTitle":"Green groups welcome Amber Rudd's appointment as climate secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/green-groups-welcome-amber-rudd-climate-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/11/green-groups-welcome-amber-rudd-climate-secretary","fields":{"headline":"Green groups welcome Amber Rudd's appointment as climate secretary","bodyText":"The promotion of the former climate change minister Amber Rudd to secretary of state for energy and climate change has been welcomed by green business groups and campaigners. David Cameron’s appointment of Rudd to the cabinet is seen as reaffirming the environmental credentials that many saw the prime minister as having abandoned. Greenpeace said it was hopeful about the appointment, while the Renewable Energy Association’s chief executive, Nina Skorupska, said: “Rudd has been a champion of renewables and the low-carbon economy in the past year and her appointment will do much to allay the fears some may have after the general election.” Rudd faces a daunting to-do list, not least helping to secure a strong deal on global warming at a UN summit in Paris in December. But having been climate change minister for most of the last year she will be able to hit the ground running. Rudd is “really green and no-nonsense” and can get things done, according to one government insider. Her past experience in investment banking, venture capital and business should be useful in delivering the huge investment needed in the UK’s energy sector, the source said. The key will be whether Rudd gets control of energy and climate change policy or is overruled by the Treasury. Rudd was first elected as an MP in 2010 and rose quickly, becoming a parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne and then assistant whip. Being relatively close to the chancellor will be vital for Rudd, though another former Decc minister – and windfarm opponent – Matt Hancock is closer to Osborne. Rudd, the MP for Hastings and Rye, frequently quotes Margaret Thatcher when asked about the Tory attitude to climate change. “The first world leader to speak about climate change at the UN was Margaret Thatcher and she of course was a scientist and the science is completely compelling,” she told Business Green in 2014. But her admiration of Thatcher may well prove more divisive in other areas. She is a strong believer in business and markets as drivers of change, rather than in the regulation and government intervention that some see as essential to tackling climate change. A looming issue is a much-delayed plan for a new nuclear power station that Rudd backs. Despite the promise of vast subsidies, the deal is still far from finalised. Rudd’s instincts will not be to throw even more billpayers’ money at the problem, but losing the station would leave a big hole in the UK’s energy plans. Rudd’s championing of the fast-growing green economy will be vital; it was barely spoken of by the Tory part of the coalition. But her commitment to protect the environment at the “lowest possible cost” is directly contradicted by the Conservatives’ own manifesto. It pledges to halt subsidies to new onshore wind farms, the cheapest renewable energy available. Rudd’s business-centred approach will also be challenged by the need to continue to increase the energy efficiency of the Britain’s cold and leaky homes. It is the cheapest way to cut carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty, but the coalition’s market-based approach, the Green Deal, was a flop. Most insulation was delivered by forcing the big energy companies to do it. A Tory aversion to more government red tape also rules out improving building regulations to provide warmer homes. However, sources have told the Guardian that Rudd does place a high priority on delivering energy efficiency. Nick Mohlo, executive director of the green business Aldresgate group, said: “Rudd is a great choice. She’s well placed to keep on building UK’s low-carbon economy and continue her work on innovation.” Rudd is the UK’s first female energy secretary, leading a department that has been headed by some famous political names including Tony Benn, Nigel Lawson and Ed Miliband."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/sep/01/george-osborne-trident-too-important-political-football","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-01T11:46:52Z","webTitle":"Trident is too important to be used for bank holiday political football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/01/george-osborne-trident-too-important-political-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/sep/01/george-osborne-trident-too-important-political-football","fields":{"headline":"Trident is too important to be used for bank holiday political football","bodyText":"George Osborne didn’t give up much by way of his weekend by spending a grey and wet bank holiday Monday visiting Britain’s Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane – where it wasn’t a bank holiday anyway. But did his blatantly tactical manoeuvre on a serious and divisive issue cost him in terms of reputation? I can see why ministers from David Cameron down can’t wait to get a crack at Jeremy Corbyn’s imminent leadership of the opposition. Andrew Sparrow sets out their thinking admirably in Tuesday’s Guardian, though our Tory pundit Matthew d’Ancona has been among those warning No 10 that an enfeebled Labour party will unleash the demons of rightwing Euroscepticism to torment them instead. But that’s only half the folly, probably the lesser half. When the chancellor, who can’t help looking and sounding as cocky as a teenager in his first long trousers, pays a rare visit to Scotland, his priority ought to be to impress Scottish voters with his grave and thoughtful behaviour, not to flick the scab off a local grievance. That’s what Osborne has done in promising an extra £500m to upgrade the base on the shores of Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute. Yes, I realise it will safeguard up to 6,700 Scottish jobs and possibly create more, and secure Britain’s future as a nuclear power, but that perspective is deeply divisive in Scotland, where assorted SNP, Labour, Green and other parties are actively hostile to everything Trident represents. In the 25 years since the cold war ended, deterrence theory and practice has been neglected, so chances are that few of them remotely understand it. That probably goes for Nicola Sturgeon’s deputy, John Swinney, who sounded off indignantly on Monday. Even Swinney, however, makes a valid point occasionally. He was right to protest that the Westminster parliament has not yet voted to renew the ageing Trident system and will not do so until March, when a Corbyn-led Labour party is likely to split on the issue. He may be wearily predictable in calling Trident the “wrong moral choice” when there are many other claims on Britain’s stretched budgets, but plenty of serious military analysts share doubts about the wisdom of spending billions on a dangerous heritage weapon that will - with luck - never be used and may destabilise relations with our potential foes. The money could better be spent strengthening hard-pressed conventional forces, they say, ones that may need to be deployed in a foreign trouble-spot despite Swinney and Corbyn’s opposition to wherever the trouble spot may be. Osborne and Cameron, who are masters of tact compared with their chip–on-his-shoulder defence secretary, Michael Fallon, are not required to consult the Scottish government on defence expenditure or deployments. Defence was correctly made the reserve of the UK government under Labour’s 1998 devolution blueprint. These matters are too important not to require a degree of consensus, let alone to be used as political footballs in such a crude and partisan way. On last year’s independence referendum, which they briefly looked like losing - itself an amazing show of ineptitude - as on Europe, the Cameron-Osborne axis looks tactically cute, but strategically foolish. The SNP, in contrast, is all strategy. It’s all about independence, and the rest can wait until that state of nirvana has been achieved. Tuesday’s FT carries a savage editorial (paywall) about the Salmond-Sturgeon government’s “incompetent” record on public service since 2007. Who’s listening? The indictment, widely shared but under-reported, includes cuts in health and education and a tendency to centralise. Scottish Tories protest that ministers overturn local planning decisions on more than half the appeals lodged, 77 out of 145. Democratic centralism indeed. Osborne also went to Aberdeen to celebrate a £3bn Danish investment in the Culzean gas field, the biggest new North Sea field for a decade. He used the jaunt to celebrate the strengths of the UK, and his new oil field tax breaks. With oil trading at less than $50 per barrel and the North Sea in decline, that’s good news for all of us and especially for Aberdeen, which is finally feeling the pinch. The handling of good news can be tacky stuff, and Sturgeon does it too. As a means of distracting from her visitor’s headlines she went to Port Glasgow on Monday to fast-forward a promising shipyard order, as you can read here in the Glasgow Herald. They shouldn’t, but they do. The nuclear defence issue is larger than that in every sense. It’s worth the gravity of measured words on a bigger occasion than a wet bank holiday, not a one-line memo from the Tories’ Australian PR guru, Lynton Crosby. As such it is one of many urgent challenges to Corbyn’s Labour – read Patrick Wintour’s terrific analysis here - that the Tories are lining up to exploit. Read Owen Jones’s grave pro-Corbyn assessment here for a positive, if daunting, perspective. Here’s a flick of deterrence theory for younger readers who were not weaned on throw-weights, ICBMs and MIRVs. It’s not an easy topic for glib conclusions either way, but political debate is also about framing the arguments. My attention was drawn to this scholarly explanation of how well conservatives frame debates in the US. In fairness, I should add that the SNP has been pretty nimble on that score too in recent years, better than the big Westminster parties. Examples of framing? Pollsters in Scotland get different answers on nuclear weapons, depending how they pose the question. So, for the anti-Trident campaigners, how about: “Why should Britain spend billions on an independent nuclear deterrent it can’t afford or use, which is neither independent nor much of a deterrent?” For the pro-nuclear camp: “Do you really want the nuclear defence of Europe against Russian expansionism in the looming post-Nato world to be left in the hands of France?” Over to you. We’ll all have to think about it soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/occams-corner/2012/nov/27/the-pros-of-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-27T12:52:22Z","webTitle":"On the pros of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2012/nov/27/the-pros-of-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/occams-corner/2012/nov/27/the-pros-of-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"On the pros of nuclear power","bodyText":"\"America is addicted to oil,\" George W Bush told us in 2006. W was worried particularly about America, but the problem is really a global one. Of course you might not want to believe the ex-president, because he also said (in the same speech): \"Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it\" – two years before the most massive financial recession seen since the 1930s. But Bush was right about the oil part. Regardless of where you stand on climate change, the world at some point and maybe sooner than we think, is going to run out of oil. According to the Hirsch report, commissioned by the US department of energy, peak oil has already occurred or is about to occur. \"Peak oil\" is simply when the world is at the peak of extracting oil from the ground, after which we will go into steep decline. If you are optimistic, peak oil isn't coming anytime soon. If like W and the Hirsch report, you are not so optimistic, peak oil has happened or is just about to and we have on the outside about 20 years until we feel the effects. Running out of oil has much bigger consequences than just not being able to drive your car to work or not being able to watch TV. Most of the world's hydrogen comes from cracking of oil into useful stuff like octane for engines, or hydrogen for hydrogen-storage, hydrogen for fertilisers that keep the world's population fed. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water but this also requires energy – which often ultimately comes from a fossil-fuel base. If we are not prepared when the world runs out of oil, bad things are going to happen. So what are the alternatives? There are many. Wind – but it has to be windy; solar – but it has to be sunny; hydroelectric – but you have to have water. While many of these energy technologies are good short-to-medium-term solutions and often the perfect local solution, what about the longer term? What about the global energy problem? What about nuclear? Until we develop new technologies, nuclear power is currently the best alternative to oil. Europe in general, and Germany in particular, have fallen out of love with nuclear power. Angela Merkel announced a plan in 2010 to phase out nuclear by 2021 – marking a complete reversal in Germany's current energy policy. The US, on the other hand, seems to be re-enamored with the nuclear idea. Barack Obama recently announced that The US department of energy, in conjunction with none other than philanthrocapitalist Bill Gates, have an aim to increase the number of nuclear reactors in the US by the year 2022. Nuclear power often gets a raw deal, partially for some very good reasons. The waste, for starters. It is difficult to know what to do with nuclear waste. It takes for ever to lose its radioactivity – so long that at the moment the only viable solution is to immobilise and store it. This is not ideal for obvious reasons. Nuclear accidents also get some rather scary press – Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island. Not that these weren't nuclear or industrial accidents, they definitely were, but it is good to be a bit careful about throwing out the baby with the cooling bath water. Nuclear accidents are sort of like plane crashes in our cultural mentality. Planes are by and large one of the safest ways to travel, yet plane crashes can hit the news for days at a time. I am not saying plane crashes aren't tragic, they are; but so is dying in a car crash – an event that happens much more often. In all of these \"disasters\" some relatively dumb mistakes and painful oversights were made. Such as waiting almost 18 hours to flood Fukushima Daiichi with sea water to cool the reactor. The potential environmental consequences seem fairly large with Chernobyl, though it is hotly debated whether this is solely the result of radiation. In the Three Mile Island meltdown, no one =even got hurt, which isn't bad going for an industrial accident. If anything, the Three Mile Island meltdown should make us all feel better about reactor safety in general. Big meltdown, no one died. There is an excellent book that compares the relative environmental and health risks of nuclear reactors with other industries – Terrestrial Energy by William Tucker, who argues that more deaths are caused by our traditional power plants than by nuclear power. Despite the downsides, the benefits of nuclear power should not be overlooked. It is not oil. Nuclear fuel does not produce CO2. Nuclear plants are relatively accident-free. There is plenty of radioactive material around currently. Nuclear fuel itself is non-renewable but breeder reactors produce more fuel than they use. The few cons there are, like storage and safety issues, are actually why governments need to fund nuclear energy research. Research monies for making safer reactors and better containment would be nice for a start, but government money needs to be found for \"blue skies\" nuclear research too. Blue-skies funding is what led scientists to find a way to split the atom in the first place. Now it is time to figure out how to safely get rid of radioactive waste. Now is the time to put some serious funding into nuclear energy research, because in 10 years we may not be able to turn the lights on. Sylvia McLain runs a research lab in Oxford.

This is the second time this year that reactors at Torness in East Lothian have been forced to close because of excessive seaweed. In 2011 it was closed by a swarm of jellyfish. Reactors need large amounts of water in order to keep them cool, and to prevent them from overheating. Seawater for cooling at Torness is filtered, but when the filters get clogged, reactors have to be shut down as a safety precaution. The station's operator, EDF Energy, has said that one of the two 640-megawatt reactors at Torness was shut down in the early hours of this morning. It is expected to remain closed for the next seven days. \"We took reactor 2 offline at 02:20 this morning due to increased seaweed ingress as a result of the weather conditions in the area,\" said the nuclear station's director, Paul Winkle. \"We are aware that at certain times of year with particular weather conditions in this part of the Forth estuary, seaweed volumes can increase and enter the station's cooling water intake system.\" Torness staff were trained to respond to this situation by taking reactors offline if necessary, he said. \"In addition, the many-layered safety systems monitor conditions like this and the plant's inbuilt mechanisms will take the unit offline automatically.\" EDF Energy was criticised by the government's nuclear safety inspectors over a seaweed blockage that closed down a Torness reactor in 2010. Inspectors identified \"a number of areas where further enhancement may be possible\" in the safety arrangements for dealing with seaweed. In a letter to members of the local liaison committee, Winkle stressed that there was \"optimum safety at all times\". He added: \"Cooling to the reactors was maintained at all times and there were no health or environmental impacts.\" Both reactors at Torness were closed down for several days in May this year by seaweed. In June 2011 they were shut because a swarm of jellyfish had blocked the coolant filters. \"This latest loss of power at Torness just underlines how unreliable nuclear power is,\" said Chas Booth, the green councillor for Leith and a member of the Torness local liaison committee. \"One week it's seaweed, the next it's jellyfish – each time it's a different excuse. It's absolutely clear that we can't depend on expensive and unreliable nuclear power to keep the lights on – we need sustained investment in energy saving and renewables instead.\" Although the UK government is pressing ahead with a new nuclear power programme, the Scottish government in Edinburgh is opposed to building more nuclear power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-09T23:03:06Z","webTitle":"Climate change: we must look to international agencies to save the world | the big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: we must look to international agencies to save the world","bodyText":"In the Observer Tech Monthly climate change special, people were asked: “Which of the following should take the most responsibility for tackling global warming?” Surely, both the 45% who answered “governments” and the 13% who answered “households/individuals” are simply wrong. Only international agencies, including the UN, EU, G7, G20, IMF and the World Bank can take action at appropriate levels. We, including governments, should try to ensure that these institutions use power in the interests of the many and the environment, not the few, rich, individuals and corporations. Many households and individuals already try to reduce personal carbon footprints, and this will continue. Worldwide, though, those who can’t afford to run a car, cook food or heat their homes adequately contribute more to reducing humanity’s collective footprint. Through the renewables levy in electricity bills, even those in fuel poverty contribute to the profits of multinational energy companies, whether or not those produce clean energy. A recession helps lower emissions, yet governments still seek and applaud growth, however achieved. Governments cannot also act together to take the truly radical steps needed. Jan Dubé Peebles I was amazed to see that we have an influential paper noticeably missing out any reference to population in the climate change equation. Our growing population drives consumerism. Meanwhile, the population of the world continues to creep up. In the UK, an estimated 1,000 births daily; worldwide, an estimated 10,000 births an hour. World population is projected to be eight billion by 2025, and that is a conservative estimate. Family planning is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions. £4 spent on contraception equals 1 tonne of carbon saved, as opposed to £35 spent on solar energy, for example. We can practice all the accepted methods to reduce carbon emissions, but a growing population will counteract all our efforts. Our world population is responsible for increasing environmental degradation and is hastening CO2 emissions, the results of which will lead to runaway climate change, increasing poverty and famine. Sheena Howarth Worcester I am really puzzled as to how you can run a major feature on climate change without a single reference to population growth. Agriculture is one of the biggest users of fossil fuel, and the necessity of feeding an ever-growing population means greater dependency on oil: it also means that more and more forests will be cleared, since we are already using practically all of the easily cultivable ground on the planet. The erosion of topsoil, rising sea levels, drought and more extreme weather all show how population levels and climate impinge on one another. Are we afraid to discuss this? I’m more afraid of the consequences of not discussing it. Paul Ehrlich quotes one demographer as saying: “We will never reach a population of 10 billion: either because we do something about it, or because we don’t.” Roger Plenty Stroud, Gloucs The nuclear industry must be patting itself on its radioactive back in response to your Tech Monthly chart, purporting to show that 91% of us would “prefer” to use energy “from less carbon-intensive sources (eg wind, hydroelectric, solar, nuclear)”. These four energy sources, bracketed together by your innocuous-looking parentheses, are presented as environmentally equivalent. How quickly have we forgotten Sellafield, Chernobyl, Fukushima? The undeniably urgent imperative to reduce carbon emissions should not blind us to the ever-present potential for catastrophe from nuclear power plant malfunctions. Your chart takes for granted what needs to be questioned and debated: namely, can we “solve” the carbon crisis at the cost of 24,000 years of pollution (the half-life of plutonium 239)?

It was clear at once that Hong Kong’s fledgling democracy was doomed. To escape Big Brother’s gaze and retain the freedom to think and write, I moved to London. On Tuesday I will stand by the Mall and watch the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and his wife glide towards Buckingham Palace in a state carriage. There will be no army tanks or trucks in this procession, but my feeling of dread will no doubt be deeper. Big Brother has arrived once more on British territory. This time, however, he is being welcomed by the UK government not with a frosty handshake but with open arms and shameless sycophancy. It will be no ordinary state visit. The leader of the world’s largest autocracy will enjoy a 103-gun royal salute and a sumptuous, white-tie state banquet attended by three generations of the royal family; he will address the houses of parliament and at night will sleep in the palace’s Belgian Suite, in the very same bed that Duke and Duchess of Cambridge used on their wedding night. It will herald, George Osborne hopes, a “golden era” in Chinese-British relations. Britain will become China’s “best partner in the west”. They will “stick together”, creating a “win-win” situation for both countries. But who will be the real winners and losers of this ignoble friendship that puts trade above human rights? For Xi the state visit is a huge propaganda coup. At home, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) considers western constitutional democracy the number one “peril in the ideological sphere”, according to a secret document circulated two years ago. Yet, sharing the contradictory mentality common to China’s dictators, Xi craves the approval of the western democracies he derides, hoping it will bolster his stature and lend an air of legitimacy to his despotic rule. Images of Xi’s regal welcome will be plastered over Chinese state media. China’s public will be encouraged to swoon over the silver-gilt candelabra adorning the royal banquet table, the flower arrangements inspected personally by the Queen, the priceless gold vessels displayed as a sign of respect for the guest of honour’s exalted rank. The message from the Chinese tyrants to their subjects will be clear: if the queen of the UK, the oldest democracy in the world, lavishes your president with such respect and approbation, then what right have you to criticise him? Huge deals set to be sealed during the visit will allow the Chinese government to pour some of its vast stockpiles of cash into British energy and transport projects, such as Hinkley Point nuclear power station and the HS2 high-speed rail line. Few other western countries would so readily grant stakes in their key infrastructure to companies run by a totalitarian government with a shaky economy, uncertain future and abysmal human rights record. But, desperate for Chinese cash to push through controversial vanity projects without compromising his beloved austerity programme, Osborne is prepared to abandon principle and endanger Britain’s national security. Had Xi’s state visit been a reward for a modest improvement in China’s human rights, perhaps the pomp and ceremony would have been more palatable. But the disgraceful truth is, his visit coincides with the most severe crackdown on Chinese civil society in a generation. According to Amnesty International, at least 245 human rights lawyers and activists have been targeted since July, and at least 30 are still missing or in police custody. Among those in secret detention is Wang Yu, a fearless defender of feminist activists and victims of rape and religious persecution. The torture inflicted on such detainees is well documented. Another human rights lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, who defended Christians and members of the Falun Gong movement, has described in horrific detail the three years he spent in solitary confinement, telling an AP journalist how, when tortured with an electric baton to his face, the sound of his screaming “was almost like a dog howling when its tail is stamped on by its master”. Meanwhile, thousands of other political prisoners continue to languish in Chinese jails. The most famous, the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, is halfway through an 11-year sentence for peacefully advocating democratic change. Ilham Tohti, a moderate Uighur academic, is serving a life sentence for striving to build bridges between Chinese Han and Muslim communities in the Xinjiang region. The situation in Tibet is no better. Since 2009, 143 Tibetans have set fire to themselves in protest against Chinese rule. The catalogue of human rights abuses committed by the CCP is endless, ranging from barbaric forced abortions and sterilisations to the muzzling of the internet. But its general secretary, Xi Jinping, is now Britain’s new best friend. Would the British government have dared roll out the red carpet for the president of Tunisia after the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010? Would it have had the gall to invite President Botha on a state visit while the world was clamouring for Nelson Mandela’s release? Engagement with the Chinese government is essential, but it is both shameful and unnecessary to shower it with honours, ignore its human rights abuses, and buckle feebly to its unreasonable demands. The British government has bent over backwards to ingratiate itself with China’s leaders. After being scolded by them for meeting the Dalai Lama in 2012, David Cameron vowed to “turn the page” and never repeat the mistake. True to his word, he snubbed the Nobel laureate during his visit to London last month. It seems pitiful that the British prime minister should allow the CCP to dictate who he does or doesn’t meet in his own country. Osborne has been equally accommodating. During his recent visit to China, he told the BBC he had raised the issue of human rights only in the context of “economic development – how we help kids from poor areas of China”. He knew full well this would please his Chinese hosts, who like to narrow discussion to economic rights while crushing the more fundamental freedoms of thought, speech and assembly, which pose a threat to their rule. This tawdry friendship of convenience, these pageants, lies and unethical compromises, may benefit Cameron and Xi, but they are an insult to the citizens of Britain, who cherish their hard-fought freedoms, and to those in China, who are still struggling courageously to achieve them. It would be naive to imagine Cameron would raise questions on human rights while toasting Xi with champagne at the banquet. But the howls of political prisoners such as Gao Zhisheng should haunt every guest. And when Cameron goes home to sleep in Number 10, and President Xi tucks himself under the silken bedspread of the Belgian Suite, one can only hope that, for a moment at least, they might be painfully aware that just a mile or so away, in an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art, a replica of a Chinese political prisoner is lying in a mock-up prison cell for all the world to see."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/10/y-fictional-prime-minister-harry-perkins-jeremy-corbyn-a-very-british-coup","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-10T17:38:51Z","webTitle":"My fictional PM was destabilised by MI5.

Corbyn’s enemies would be in his own ranks","bodyText":"‘The news that Harry Perkins was to become prime minister went down very badly in the Athenaeum.” So ran the opening line from A Very British Coup. My 1982 novel was predicated on the surprise election of a leftwing Labour government led by a Sheffield steel worker that is then destabilised by the forces of darkness – a cabal of press barons in cahoots with M15, the CIA and with a little help from Labour insiders. It was, as the Guardian’s Simon Hoggart remarked at the time, “a delicious fantasy”. It couldn’t happen now, could it? Successive election defeats and the triumph of New Labour have surely put paid for ever to the prospect of a leftwing Labour party capable of winning an election. Or have they? As it happens I long ago tapped out the first 5,000 words or so of a sequel, but fantasy or not, the astonishing rise of Jeremy Corbyn has given a new lease of life to the real-life possibility, however remote. At recent speaking engagements all available copies of the novel, which is still in print, were gobbled up within minutes. Repeatedly I was asked about the possibility of a Corbyn victory. Gently I pointed out that a party led by Corbyn, saintly and decent man that he is, was likely to be unelectable. Which only met with the riposte that since the other three candidates appear to be unelectable too, why not go for the real thing? But delicious fantasy or not, let us for a moment suspend judgment and consider how the political establishment would react to a Corbyn victory. One thing for sure, his honeymoon would be short. His first challenge would be the fact that he has very little support in the parliamentary Labour party. Appeals to loyalty are likely to fall on deaf ears, given his record as a serial dissident. The good news for Corbyn is that, unlike in the 80s, defections are unlikely. A few people may retire earlier than intended, but I know of no one who thinks an SDP mark II would be a good idea, and the Liberal Democrats are not likely to be an attractive option for the foreseeable future. Corbyn’s principal problem would probably be the sullen indifference of parliamentary colleagues, rather than outright rebellion, though one can’t rule out a direct challenge in due course. In politics, however, nothing is impossible. Today’s bogeymen can become tomorrow’s national treasures, albeit usually only after they have been rendered harmless. Suppose that Corbyn was to make it unscathed to the general election. Suppose, too, that the country was wearying of the Tories and their endless austerity, and that the polls had begun to predict that the gap between the two parties was closing. The Conservatives and all their friends in the media would, of course, attempt to organise mass hysteria – but it might not work. Corbyn has several obvious advantages over mainstream rivals, such as the fact that he is an entirely different breed of politician to those the electorate has, fairly or not, come to despise. He is modest and untainted by any whiff of scandal, and has held broadly consistent views all his life. Unlike many leftists he is not given to ranting or rabble-rousing. On the contrary, he has conducted himself well so far. A sustained campaign on affordable housing might even win him friends across the board in the south-east of England, where Labour most needs votes. Yes, stretching the political elastic to its limit, a Corbyn government is just about conceivable. If so, we are in Harry Perkins territory. The gloves would come off. The “coup” in the novel is that the election of Perkins is greeted by a huge run on sterling orchestrated by Treasury civil servants. A leading trade unionist is persuaded to organise a power industry strike, leading to blackouts. Perkins is finally brought down after being blackmailed by M15 over a relationship he once had with a woman who worked to the boss of a nuclear power company with whom he had dealings when he was secretary of state for energy. In this case it is unlikely that M15 would interfere. It has its work cut out keeping track of Islamists, and has been cleaned up since the scandals of the 80s. (“We’ve cleared out a lot of dead wood,” a Tory home secretary once whispered to me.) The Americans are also unlikely to interfere unless their bases were threatened. Phasing out Trident wouldn’t bother them – they were never keen on our so-called independent deterrent. Like that of Harry Perkins (and Harold Wilson), a Corbyn government would have problems with the bankers and the Treasury. These days,with a floating currency, runs on the pound are difficult to organise, but the deficit (which, despite their promises, the Tories won’t have abolished) and the balance of payments could be talked up, and a crisis easily organised. The media barons would be a problem too. Opportunities for mischief would be legion. If it were up to me, rather than meet them head on, I’d offer the Murdochs a deal: a much larger share of Sky in exchange for relinquishing their British newspapers. You never know, it might wash. The tricky moment would come when things started to go wrong, as they do for all governments. A few bad polls, bad economic news, electricity blackouts, a blockade of oil refineries … at that point, our beloved leader would face a challenge from someone within his own ranks, perhaps in league with the enemy. Yes, I think I am beginning to see my way to a sequel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/27/europes-biggest-polluter-protesters-lignite-mine-germany-direct-action","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T15:43:15Z","webTitle":"The day we stopped Europe’s biggest polluter in its tracks | Jay Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/27/europes-biggest-polluter-protesters-lignite-mine-germany-direct-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/27/europes-biggest-polluter-protesters-lignite-mine-germany-direct-action","fields":{"headline":"The day we stopped Europe’s biggest polluter in its tracks","bodyText":"This month, I broke the law. I wasn’t alone; I was with 1,500 others, many of whom had never broken any law for their beliefs before. Together we managed to shut down Europe’s biggest source of CO2 emissions: RWE’s lignite mines in the Rhineland in Germany. In total, around 800 of us were arrested, and hundreds of us refused to cooperate with the authorities by withholding our names and IDs. This hampered the bureaucracy so badly that we were released without charge. It was the world’s largest act of disobedience against the mining of fossil fuels – and it might be the spark that ignites a rising, cross-border movement of disobedience for climate justice. With a circumference of 20km and a depth of 400 metres, the open-cast mine is the biggest hole I have ever seen. It feels part-desert, part post-apocalyptic movie set, a place that belongs more on Mars than on Earth. It’s a hole that makes money for a few and imposes misery on most. It has eaten up so many homes and lives: since the second world war, lignite mines have displaced 35,000 people – and 7,000 more await a similar fate. Abandoned villages sit on the mine’s edge, with empty streets, churches, schools and hospitals, and ivy growing through broken letter boxes. Even the bodies from the graveyards have had to be moved to safety. These ghost villages then wait to be engulfed by the ever-expanding hole. The mine and its accompanying power stations are surrounded by fields of industrial wind turbines, a greenwashed, “eco-friendly” back drop, to make us forget that the “great green” German state – which is phasing out nuclear power, and is renowned for its “renewable energy transition” – still produces 45% of its electricity with coal. Thousands had been preparing for this moment of disobedience for a week at the Climate Camp, a temporary model of an alternative society set up near the mine. At dawn on Saturday 15 August, we left the camp, with its self-managed workshops, trainings, film shows and lectures, approaching the mine from four different directions in “fingers” – long columns of about 250 people all dressed in white paper boiler suits. Our only protection against police truncheons and pepper spray was bags filled with soft straw to take the blows. Everyone on the action had agreed to remain calm and were determined not to escalate any police violence or sabotage the mine’s machinery. To get to the mine we had to go through a narrow tunnel. But it was blocked by vans and three rows of riot police. It was terrifying, yet we knew what to do. We took a deep collective breath and our finger flowed like a river into the obstruction, body against body, the whole column pushing from behind. In the crush I saw truncheons flailing, one hit me but the adrenaline cut out the pain. Pepper spray was aimed directly at our eyes. Time stood still and then … we were through. Despite 1,500 police officers and 800 RWE employees protecting the site, nothing could stop such collective courage. Eight hundred of us got into the mine, and some as far as the monstrous excavators. These are 222 metres long, and taller than the Statue of Liberty. Half a dozen of them continuously gnaw at the canyon sides of the mine, each one able to dig out 2,400 train carriages of coal a day. These are machines engineered to cut through mountains. Down in the depths of the mine, we were again chased by police, this time riding on RWE-owned 4x4s. But we just kept running towards the machines. Group after group was eventually arrested and handcuffed and held for nine hours in the deep sand of the mine, but we nourished ourselves with acts of tender solidarity. Unable to feed ourselves, people passed food from mouth to mouth, kissing relative strangers in the process. And around us everything was blocked, the machines were silent; we had forced the mine to stop for an entire day. The protest was called Ende Gelände (Here and no further) – and it was direct action at its best. Not a symbolic gesture that just tells a story and makes an injustice visible, but an action that targeted the very source of the problem and stopped it in its tracks. Of course, the stories from the day are important, and will help build confidence within the movement. But the actual stopping of CO2 emissions themselves, the fact that the lignite coal – the dirtiest type of coal in the world – was not dug out and burned that day, is what counts. Ende Gelände was a collective act of resistance that for once felt proportionate to the scale of the emergency: catastrophic climate change. The fact that 80% of the world’s fossil fuel reserves need to remain unburned if we are to avoid the catastrophe of runaway climate change means that we will have to fight with every tactic we think is just, strategic and, most importantly, effective. Historically, when movements win it is because they fought harder than they thought was possible and used a whole range of means. It is time to move away from purely symbolic and ritualised displays of dissent and use tactics that are proportionate to the problems. This is what our children will judge us on. They won’t ask: “Did you march in the streets or sabotage the machines at night?” They will ask: “Did you manage to stop them destroying our planet?” At Ende Gelände, thousands experienced a collective power. I have never seen so many people jump so far out of their comfort zones, by taking direct action for the first time. Never have I been part of such disciplined, determined disobedience. A line has been drawn in the sand. When the COP21 UN climate summit takes place in Paris, and thousands take part in a day of disobedience on 12 December, the shout from the streets may well, once again, be: Ende Gelände. The corporations and governments have failed us. It’s time for direct action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/jun/18/mrsa-pork-responsible-farming-superbug-antibiotics-farms-meat","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T16:40:05Z","webTitle":"The scare over MRSA in pork shows responsible farming isn’t a luxury – it’s a necessity | Joanna Blythman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/mrsa-pork-responsible-farming-superbug-antibiotics-farms-meat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/mrsa-pork-responsible-farming-superbug-antibiotics-farms-meat","fields":{"headline":"The scare over MRSA in pork shows responsible farming isn’t a luxury – it’s a necessity","bodyText":"To say that you boycott factory-farmed meat, and only buy organic, or grass-fed or free-range, has until now, instantly identified you in many people’s minds as one of the neurotic rich – someone with not enough else to worry about. Why avoid cheaper, ubiquitous, normal meat from intensive farming operations when most people seem to have an insatiable appetite for it? Where’s the harm? Intensive production is clean, efficient and modern, we’re told, the only way to put meat on everyone’s plates. Perhaps those who have systematically dismissed the grave problems incubating in industrial livestock units will now revisit their complacency. A Guardian investigation has just revealed the presence of a strain of the potentially fatal, antibiotic-resistant superbug MRSA in pork chops, bacon, and gammon sold in leading British supermarkets. Of 100 items tested nine were found to contain the bug. Eight were imported from Denmark. Separate tests, carried out on behalf of a campaign group, the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, have also identified three strains of MRSA in British pork mince and sausages. The evidence that the human health risk of factory-farmed pork can no longer be brushed off as theoretical or hysteric. It’s on our plates, right here and now. How on earth did we get into this mess? The Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for food safety, and the farming establishment, will doubtless rush to downplay the risk by telling us that adequate cooking will kill off the bacterium, a familiar refrain from apologists for factory farming. It was used when we learned that 73% of UK chickens were contaminated with the food poisoning bug campylobacter, the implication being that if anyone gets ill or dies, it’s the fault of home cooks. This passing-the-buck defence of the status quo is wearing thin. MRSA can be transferred to people’s skin when it is handled before cooking, potentially causing an infection at a later date. Do we need nuclear power station-style full protective clothing to handle supermarket meat these days? There is no mystery here. The causal link between the abuse of antibiotics on the factory farm and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bugs that cause human infections is widely recognised by organisations including the WHO and the European Food Safety Authority. Of all of our livestock, pigs and chickens are the most drugged-up. The use of antibiotics as growth-promoters has been banned by the EU since 2006. But to please supermarkets, keep prices low and reduce production costs, animals must be packed into sheds, their feed often routinely medicated with antibiotics in a vain attempt to keep a lid on the inevitable health problems cooked up by keeping livestock in fundamentally inhumane and often insanitary conditions. This need for prophylactic dispensing of antibiotics is a consequence of the inherent brinkmanship of intensive meat production. If you keep farm animals as they should be kept, in smaller numbers, and encourage them to range outdoors when weather allows, this fosters their good health, so that preventative antibiotic prescriptions aren’t required. In organic farming systems, pigs and other livestock can be treated with antibiotics only if they show clinical signs of illness. In intensive systems, whole sheds of pigs are systematically eating sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics in their feed. This is madness. England’s chief medical officer Sally Davies has warned that the threat of antimicrobial resistance is “catastrophic” and on a par with climate change and terrorism. Medics now try not to prescribe antibiotics unless they are clearly the only option, recognising that overuse heavily compromises the effectiveness of these hugely important medicines in humans. But while they have responded to warnings that many valuable antibiotics could be rendered useless, for the big pig-meat producers little has changed: farm animals account for 45% of UK antibiotic use. It’s little wonder that factory-farmers can’t break their drug habit when their supermarket masters, too busy trumpeting that their pork (or chicken) is fresh and cheap, don’t set antibiotic-reduction targets for their suppliers. The discovery of MRSA in pork underscores the urgent need for a legally binding timetable to phase out routine, prophylactic use of antibiotics in farming. A tax on farmyard antibiotics has also been mooted as a fiscal measure that might curb use. For those of us who buy meat, we have to ask ourselves one question. Are we willing to pay a bit more for it, to help prolong the ability of these vital drugs to save not only our lives, but also those of future generations?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/jun/18/cutting-windfarm-subsidy-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T10:28:55Z","webTitle":"Cutting the onshore wind subsidy is perverse nimbyism | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/cutting-windfarm-subsidy-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/cutting-windfarm-subsidy-tories","fields":{"headline":"Cutting the onshore wind subsidy is perverse nimbyism","bodyText":"Today, the government fulfils one of its most perverse manifesto pledges – to end the subsidy for onshore wind turbines a year early, in April 2016. This is cavalier and contrary policy-making, designed to please the nimbys in its shire heartlands, regardless of wider energy policy, regardless of climate change. As the Tories plunge ahead with far more expensive, disruptive and unpopular fracking, onshore wind energy is the cheapest of all renewables, and Britain one of the most wind-rich spots on earth. What a long journey Cameron has travelled since the days when he fixed a symbolic turbine on his own roof. This is a very particular political payoff to small groups in key Tory seats, a payback to key climate change-denying windfarm-haters in the Tory press and an appeaser for restless Tory backbenchers after their first EU rebellion. As for the public, polls show two-thirds of people strongly in favour of onshore wind, including in areas where turbines are planned, while only a quarter support fracking. This is another sign of Cameron’s recklessness towards to the union: Scotland was not consulted before this announcement, and yet has 70% of planned windfarm sites. What an odd moment to announce this in-your-face attack on environmentalism on the very day the Pope issues his climate change encyclical, calling it a moral challenge to global indifference. “This home of ours is being ruined and that damages everyone, especially the poor,” he said yesterday. He has triggered a furore ahead of his trip to the US, inflaming Republican climate change sceptics as his encyclical is unequivocal in affirming that climate change is mostly man made, and calls for an end to the use of fossil fuels as a source of energy. Odd timing, too, when we have just had the hottest May on record, according to Nasa’s global temperature data, and the past 12 months have reached record levels. There is, they say, no pause in global warming – it’s a rising staircase instead of a ramp: we are now taking another upward step. An odd day, too, for secretary of state for energy and climate change Amber Rudd’s provocative act, an aggressive riposte to yesterday’s lobby of parliament bringing people from all over Britain, from Polzeath and Aberdeen to press MPs on the urgency of action against climate change. Among those who came were some from the Somerset Levels, including a farmer who talked of her land still suffering from the damage done by the severe floods of the 2013/14 winter when the River Parrett overflowed. In all of Somerset, there is only one wind turbine, due to small groups of protesters. But you might think the proposal of Ecotricity to put up just four turbines in the Parrett valley would have a fair wind. You would think the area had suffered so severely that it would be the obvious place. If not there, then where? I visited the aptly named Black Ditch site, no beauty spot, but a scrubby piece of land beside the busy M5 motorway, by a demolished Royal Ordnance factory. The valley is crisscrossed in all directions by enormous pylons bestriding the countryside, carrying electricity from the nearby Hinkley Point nuclear power station. The turbines would have powered 6,769 homes but they were opposed by a small group and former department for communities and local government secretary Eric Pickles stopped it. In his last year, Pickles blocked 85% of windfarm projects, which lost over £500m in income and 2,000 scarce rural jobs, killing off investment in an industry providing the cheapest renewables. The EU reports that onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas and nuclear energy when the cost of pollution is factored in, especially the high cost of climate change. But the government will not only stop the subsidy for onshore wind projects, just as it is on the verge of becoming sustainable, but will also now let local councils and residents veto them. The likelihood is that small, vocal groups will stop them, regardless of wider local opinion, let alone national opinion. Renewables UK, speaking for the industry, warns that energy prices will rise as the governments cuts off the cheapest renewable energy supply, chilling future investment. This, remember, was going to be “the greenest government ever” until Cameron changed course and said “cut the green crap” instead. So, here goes the green crap."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/27/fossil-fuels-workers-retraining-carbon-neutral-solar-wind-energy-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"What will happen to oil and gas workers as the world turns carbon neutral?","bodyText":"Adriaan Kamp used to be a die-hard oilman. After 17 years at Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell, the 54-year-old Dutchman now runs a consultancy based in Oslo advising national governments on transitioning to cleaner energy. “In 2007 to 2008, we were looking at future energy scenarios in the Shell Group [and] there was a question on my desk about how do we play with renewables,” he says. “And from there, the journey started.” If the energy sector is to become carbon neutral by 2070, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change insists must happen to avoid a temperature rise of more than two degrees celsius, hundreds of thousands of workers will need to follow Kamp’s lead. The renewable sector in Europe alone could produce 6.1m new jobs by 2050, according to trade union Sustainlabour. By the same token, divestment in coal, oil and gas, and other carbon-intensive sectors could lead to a massive shake-up elsewhere in the global labour market. Industry skills In terms of skills, transitioning from old to new energy sectors should be comparatively straightforward. There’s “no magic” to renewable technologies, says Kamp. “Managing a wind farm or solar project is nothing a good oil and gas man who has built or organised facilities cannot manage,” he says. Sophie Bennett, policy officer for RenewableUK, agrees. Many of the technical and managerial needs of the low-carbon energy sector are similar to those in traditional energy and power industries, she says. But despite high demand for such expertise in the renewables sector, the transfer of skilled labour from fossil fuel sectors remains a trickle. If that’s to increase, governments need to make firm commitments and establish a long-term vision in support of energy transition, Bennett argues. “Policy uncertainty on renewables can hinder expenditure on skills by the industry. Plus, the skills interventions that are needed – such as apprenticeships and education outreach programmes – can require a long incubation period,” she says. The low-carbon sector itself is making small inroads with respect to the skills it needs. In the UK, for instance, the renewable training network provides training courses for technical, engineering and business roles. German engineering giant Siemens, meanwhile, offers a two-year training programme to equip graduates for work in the wind industry. Few equivalents can be found in fossil fuel industries. There’s a partial exception in the mining sector: mining firm Anglo American, headquartered in London, has a formal mine closure policy that includes employee reskilling and retraining. However, such re-employment schemes rarely direct workers specifically to the low-carbon energy sector. The UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) marks a rare attempt to do so. As part of a five-year retraining programme ahead of the anticipated decommissioning of two nuclear power stations in north Wales, workers were offered courses to obtain professional certificates valid in the renewable sector. Almost 9% of the 534 participating employees chose to do so. Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, managing director of Menter Môn Cyf, which administered the retraining on behalf of the NDA, believes all carbon-intensive industries should be obliged to offer employees retraining in line with government decarbonisation targets. “If it can be done in nuclear, then it should be done in the equally wealthy fossil fuel sector,” he says. Government responsibility Even in the event of such a system, many believe that governments need to take the lead, not industry. “It’s public authorities’ responsibility to create the policy and investment framework where energy transition will take place,” says Benjamin Denis, policy adviser on climate change at the European Trade Union Confederation. “Companies of course have a responsibility, but I don’t expect Shell or BP to take voluntary initiatives to pay attention to workers impacted by the transition.”Decarbonisation is an emotive issue for many labour unions. Earlier this year German trade unions threatened mass mobilisation in the wake of aggressive energy transition plans. Denis maintains that clean energies are not yet a “job killer”, but insists governments must provide training programmes to avoid them becoming so in the future. “We can’t decarbonise the economy, which is still massively fossil fuel-based, without changing the labour market. That’s why we are calling for a just transition,” he says. Examples of government-led integrated training strategies remain scant, however. Those that do exist, such as in Denmarkand Scotland, tend to be relatively small scale and locally targeted. A recent OECD study of green skills provision in Europe confirms that many governments’ green skills policies are “uncertain and fragmented”. Fuelling the current disarray is a lack of data on the types of jobs that employers in low-carbon industries will need in the future. The OECD advises governments to integrate green skills into mainstream education, rather than creating separate systems of training. It also recommends a focus on transferal skills rather than on occupation-specific training. As for financing such programmes, the European Commission says money is already there in existing green-growth funds. In its green employment initiative (pdf), released in 2014, it singles out pots such as the European social fund and the European development fund. In the US, meanwhile, training providers and industries can access a variety of federal government grants for green skills initiatives. Trade unions, however, argue that additional funds should also be found to support communities that will be especially hard-hit by a shift to cleaner energy – such as North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and Poland’s Silesia, which are both highly dependent on coal production. “In such regions, if you do not organise a strong social protection system, decarbonisation will have dramatic effects on the workforce and the communities,” says Denis, adding that such a system falls to local authorities, national governments and the EU to create jointly. Back in Oslo, former oilman Kamp welcomes any attempts governments can make to inspire people to pursue careers in clean energy sectors. “Creating an image of the renewable industry as an exciting career has to be a good thing,” he says. “But, at the end, there needs to be a job market that delivers it.” Sign up here for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

She chose the area carefully, she says. It’s next to a lake, untouched by industry and – crucially for the mathematician who worked on contamination models in the aftermath of Chernobyl – unaffected by the fallout from the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. But six months after she bought her dream home, Belarus announced that a new nuclear power station, financed by Russia, would be built nearby in Ostrovets. “I’m completely devastated,” says Novikova, who says the government bypassed official planning regulations, ignored safety concerns and failed to carry out an adequate environmental impact assessment for the plant. Her experience with Chernobyl, when radioactive contamination forced around 350,000 people to leave their homes and led to an unknown number of deaths, have left her cautious about nuclear power and distrustful of government safety promises. “Another Chernobyl cannot happen,” she says. Novikova has appealed to international environmental authorities to try to stop the NPP project, without any success. In the meantime authorities have already started work on construction. \"The problem is that [Belarusian president Alexander] Lukashenko does not give his citizens a voice,\" she says. In a country which does not tolerate activism or public protest – the annual Chernobyl anniversary marches she organises often end in arrests – Novikova has taken her opposition abroad. She is in London to raise awareness about the issue and hopes to spur the EU to put pressure on Belarus, as the plant would be 60km from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. A group of Belarusian activists, including the theatre company Belarus Free Theatre, have launched a petition against the power station – and have won support from some high-profile figures: The petition cites several problems with the plant: Construction was started before design plans were in place, and before a license had been issued The design is experimental and has not been properly tested An assessment by more that 15 independent experts found gaping holes in the government's environmental impact assessment Novikova says the plans flaunt international regulations; Belarus is a signatory of the Espoo and Aarhus conventions, which specify environmental protections and monitor requirements such as public consultations over construction projects. She approached the Aarhus committee in Maastricht in June, asking them to prevent the power plant because Belarus had violated the convention by not discussing the issue with concerned citizens. The committee came back to her with bad news; they would only issue what she calls a \"caution of a caution\" to Belarus, believing the government wouldn't listen anyway. \"Lukashenko says [the plant] is important for energy security,\" she says. \"But if technology is so advanced, why not solve [the problem of] nuclear waste? We could improve our energy system by modernising gas plants, or using bioenergy from agriculture.\" Presidential elections next year won’t change anything, she says, although she is hopeful that the conflict in Ukraine might change the politics of the region and ultimately loosen Lukashenko's power: \"We and Ukraine have the same problem – [the Russian president, Vladimir] Putin.\" The proposed new plant in Belarus will be funded by Russia. Belarus's official cost estimate is 9.4 billion US dollars, with one third of this to be spent by 2015. Its reactors would be constructed by the Russian company AtomEnergoMash. Novikova is critical of the EU for not clamping down on nuclear power in the wake of the Fukishima nuclear disaster of 2011, and points out that some countries are steering away from nuclear energy. \"Germany is phasing out of nuclear power; it produced 50% of all electricity generation from more renewable sources last year. The Italians said no in their nuclear referendum.\" Like many Belarusian activists, Novikova has faced severe harassment. She was detained in her own home in Minsk during anti-nuclear protests. Her elderly mother has received prank calls which the police confirmed came from the KGB. In Russia, she was arrested and jailed for five days for trying to hand in an environmental petition to the Russian embassy. She was also was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011, and can't tell if she was contaminated from radiation exposure from Chernobyl. The WHO says the disaster will cause 50,000 new cases of the cancer among young people living in the worst-affected region. Increased rates of thyroid cancer are also being reported in Japan, post-Fukushima. But she refuses to dwell on her own problems: \"I’m still alive. Mine is not the worst case of persecution of people.\" \"What should I do? Stop my fight? I lost my health, now I have lost my house,\" she says. \"Why should I run from this problem? I could go to the US or Europe, but it won’t change if I run – maybe I will, if my life will be in danger. Nobody knows. Right now, I have an opportunity to do something.\" • This article was amended on 29 July to make clear that Belarus had not violated the Aarhus convention 'by not obtaining official planning permission', in Tatiana Novikova's eyes, but by 'not discussing the issue with concerned citizens'."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2013/mar/04/risk-energy-shortages-blackouts-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-04T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK needs 'plan B' for new nuclear power, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/04/risk-energy-shortages-blackouts-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2013/mar/04/risk-energy-shortages-blackouts-reactors","fields":{"headline":"UK needs 'plan B' for new nuclear power, say MPs","bodyText":"The government needs a \"plan B\" on nuclear power, because of the danger that new reactors will not be built in time to avoid energy shortages and possible blackouts, an influential committee of MPs has warned. The warning follows concerns raised by Alistair Buchanan, the outgoing chief executive of the energy regulator, Ofgem, that the decommissioning of many of the UK's ageing fleet of power stations could sharply increase the risk of shortages within a few years. Already, the ambitions of the UK's nuclear industry have been dealt significant blows in recent months. The Horizon consortium fell apart and is seeking a buyer, possibly from China, and Cumbria's councillors rejected the building of a long-term waste repository there. EDF Energy, the French national energy company that will lead the building of the first plant, is in a stand-off with ministers over demands for higher prices for its energy, and work on the first potential reactor is likely to face further opposition, endangering the government's timetable for new plants. Any power shortages are unlikely to result in blackouts for consumers in the short term, but could affect businesses that are on contracts, forcing them to close if there is an imbalance between supply and demand, and this could be expensive. Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy and climate change select committee, said: \"The government seems to be crossing its fingers that private companies will deliver a fleet of new nuclear power stations on time and on budget. Ministers need to urgently come up with a contingency plan in case the nuclear industry does not deliver the new power stations we need.\" Green campaigners fear that the government will try to fill the gap by encouraging the building of new gas-fired power stations, instead of more renewable power, and that this could put climate targets out of reach and leave consumers vulnerable to volatility in the price of imports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jun/21/writing-michael-gove-boris-johnson-reveal-chilling-double-act-brexit-leave","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-21T17:07:14Z","webTitle":"The writings of Gove and Boris reveal a chilling double act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/writing-michael-gove-boris-johnson-reveal-chilling-double-act-brexit-leave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jun/21/writing-michael-gove-boris-johnson-reveal-chilling-double-act-brexit-leave","fields":{"headline":"The writings of Gove and Boris reveal a chilling double act","bodyText":"If Britain votes to leave the European Union on Thursday, the chances of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove running the country will increase. In such a nightmare scenario, we need to know what the two leading Brexiteers stand for and what they are likely to do to us if, as is not impossible, a discredited David Cameron is toppled. To find out how they would change Britain, I have been reading their books – everything from Johnson’s The Perils of the Pushy Parents: A Cautionary Tale to Gove’s Celsius 7/7 (with its clunky subtitle that some editor should have rejected: How the West’s Policy of Appeasement Has Provoked Yet More Fundamentalist Terror – and What Has to Be Done Now). There is an immediate problem in trying to work out what they stand for: Boris Johnson. Even Johnson doesn’t know what he stands for. On the campaign trail in the 2005 general election he said: “What’s my view on drugs? I’ve forgotten my view on drugs.” Johnson is to British politics what the Red Queen was to Through The Looking-Glass: a virtuoso of inconsistency. For instance, if you read The Perils of the Pushy Parents, his debut book of poetry from 2007 (and I strongly urge that you don’t), you’ll find the following argument (if that isn’t too strong a word): “Loving parents, learn from me. If your children crave TV Tell them, OK, what the hell You can watch it for a spell … IF YOU READ A BOOK AS WELL. (A proper book, you’ll understand Like the volume in your hand.)” There is lots more of this prosodically challenged guff. But that’s not the point. The point is that a few months before this poem was published, Johnson argued the opposite. He posted a rant against video games on his website: “Summon up all your strength, all your courage. Steel yourself for the screams and yank out that plug. And if they still kick up a fuss, then get out the sledgehammer and strike a blow for literacy.” Like the Red Queen, Johnson is capable of believing as many as six impossible things before breakfast. He once said of the former leader of the Labour party: “He is a mixture of Harry Houdini and a greased piglet. He is barely human in his elusiveness. Nailing Blair is like trying to pin jelly to a wall.” Blair might have replied: “Pot, kettle.” Gove, by contrast, is utterly consistent, immovable granite to Johnsonian jelly. The ideas that Gove developed in Celsius 7/7, written shortly after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, have guided many of his policies as a government minister. For instance, in 2014, as David Cameron’s education secretary, Gove appointed Peter Clarke, former national head of counter-terrorism, to investigate the alleged Islamisation of Birmingham schools and rumours about children being tutored in extremism. Eyebrows were raised: why not an education professional, official or judge to run the inquiry? Reading Celsius 7/7 helps us understand why. In that book, Gove effectively posed as a latter-day Churchill, indicting Britain for its policy of appeasement. “Nowhere has moral clarity been more lacking in British state policy over the last 10 to 15 years,” Gove wrote, “than in our approach to the Islamist threat.” Islamists were infiltrating education in the same way the Trotskyist entryists of Militant had taken over parts of the Labour party in the 1980s, he suggested. Celsius 7/7 starts with a chilling image, that of Mohammad Sidique Khan sitting thoughtfully at a Yorkshire school where he was employed as teaching mentor. “His professional life was dedicated to helping the children of recent immigrants make the most of their opportunities in the United Kingdom,” wrote Gove. On 7 July 2005, Khan detonated a bomb on a Circle line train leaving Edgware Road tube station in London, joining three others in a suicide attack in which 52 died and 700 were injured. “They were not,” wrote Gove, “desperately poor and voiceless outsiders, Frantz Fanon’s ‘wretched of the earth’ driven to violence because no other option lay open to them to secure justice. They had enjoyed the freedoms and opportunities of the west, holding down respected jobs and living lives of relative comfort … As Khan himself proclaimed, in a videotape broadcast after his death, ‘We are at war and I am a soldier.’” Like Khan, Gove thought he was at war. Like George W Bush, he saw the world in Manichean terms. Like political scientist Samuel P Huntington, author of The Clash of Civilisations, Gove was possessed by the idea that the primary post-cold war geopolitical struggle would be between western democracy and radical Islam. And when Gove came to political office, first as education secretary and then justice secretary, he put his anti-appeasement ideas into practice. He had, for instance, a notorious argument with home secretary Theresa May. She wanted a narrow focus on individuals posing a security threat, he told former colleagues at the Times, while Gove wanted to take on ideas “to drain the swamp” before “the crocodiles reach the boat”. In Celsius 7/7, he developed another image. Chapter 8 was entitled The Trojan Horse and its suggestion was that the enemies of British values were already subverting democracy from within. Strikingly, in 2014, a leaked letter was published, alleged to be from Birmingham Islamists, ostensibly detailing a plot to take over schools in the area and make them adopt a more reactionary Islamic curriculum. It became known as the “Trojan horse letter”. Some supposed it a forgery; others, such as Gove, saw it as confirmation that British values were under threat. One of Gove’s responses to the Trojan horse scandal in Birmingham was his announcement, in 2014, that in the future all of England’s 20,000 primary and secondary schools would have “to respect the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs”. He added that teachers would be banned from the profession if they allowed extremists into classrooms. Celsius 7/7 was the diagnosis; his policies, ostensibly, the cure. In 2006, Gove’s book was denounced by critics such as Steven Poole in the Guardian (“What universe is Gove living in? Why, the universe of ‘moral clarity’, a phrase that resounds throughout the book and which, as usual, announces a jejune cowboys-and-Indians worldview. Remarkably trite”) and even by the Daily Telegraph reviewer, who feared that Gove’s parallel between the cold war and the west’s war against the “totalitarian ideology” of global Islamism “is misleading, and even dangerous”. Intriguingly, though, Geoffrey Wheatcroft claimed in the Guardian in 2007 that Gove’s “Muslim-bashing diatribe Celsius 7/7 is given to every lucky person who joins the CFI [the Conservative Friends of Israel]”. In 2014, the application of that book’s ideas to British politics was also attacked. Former Conservative minister Crispin Blunt accused Gove of using Britain’s national security council to promote “neocon” ideas that could encourage moderates to move towards Islamist extremism. Blunt argued Gove’s approach would be “impractical and counter-productive”. Why? “You would find that people who are in the shades of grey are then driven into being black because they are invited to choose between black and white.” That’s to say, if there is a Trojan horse in Britain subverting our values and helping terrorism thrive, perhaps its name is Michael Gove. After reading Gove’s Manichean philippic, Johnson’s writings are a jaunty relief, particularly when he goes off-message. In his 2006 book The Dream of Rome, for instance, Johnson argued that Turkey should become a member of the European Union. What on earth was he on about? His chums in the leave campaign – Gove and defence minister Penny Mordaunt – think letting Turkey in would be bonkers. “This will not only increase the strain on Britain’s public services, but it will also create a number of threats to UK security,” said Mordaunt recently. “Crime is far higher in Turkey than the UK. Gun ownership is also more widespread.” Indeed, one argument Mordaunt set out for Brexit was that her boss, David Cameron, could not veto Turkey’s membership (a claim, to be fair, that the PM retorted was nonsense). So what made Boris call for Turks to be admitted to the EU? He saw the Turkish people, not so much as a gun-toting, fast-breeding crime wave poised to break over the white cliffs of Dover, but as venerable and much-loved denizens of the cradle of civilisation. He called for Turkey to be admitted, “not just on grounds of religious tolerance, but also because Turkey, after all, was where the [Roman] empire survived for another 1,000 years until 1453. It would be good to bring the Turks in, and reunite the two halves of the Roman empire.” Perhaps there was another reason for Johnson’s (if this isn’t too strong a word) policy proposal – his ancestry. As he wrote in a 2006 volume of collected journalism, Have I Got Views for You: “My father’s father’s father was a romantic Turkish politician … whose career ended in a series of judgments that were romantic and certainly conservative but unwise and sometimes reckless.” Romantic, conservative, unwise, reckless – add to that description “inconsistent” and you have Boris’s political philosophy. What does Boris stand for? Nuclear power. Why? “It is not just that nuclear energy is environmentally friendly in itself … It also offers the hope that we can restore British activity and prestige in the physical sciences, not just as an end in itself, but because if we have to rely endlessly on the Russians for our gas, and on the Arabs for our oil, then no nukes will be bad nukes,” (Have I Got Views for You, p85). And then there was his call for the re-Britannification of Britain. By which he meant that we had a lot to learn from the US. “In the wake of [Enoch] Powell’s racist foray, no one had the guts to talk about Britishness, or whether it was a good thing to insist – as the Americans do so successfully – on the basic loyalty of immigrants to the country of immigration.” Like Gove, Johnson had Muslims in his cross-hairs: “If that means the end of spouting hate in mosques, and treating women as second-class citizens, then so be it. We need to acculturate the second–generation Muslim communities to our way of life, and end the obvious alienation they feel,” (Have I Got Views for You, p139). He didn’t explain how. He also expressed strong, if contrary, views on racism. “When I shamble around the park in my running gear late at night, and I come across that bunch of black kids, shrieking in the spooky corner by the disused gents, I would love to pretend that I don’t turn a hair,” (Have I Got Views for You, p126). Do such sentiments make him a racist? By no means, Johnson argued. “In fact, I like to think my instincts, in this respect, are as blameless as those of the average Guardian reader; and the thing is I am guilty nonetheless, not of racism but of spasms of incorrectitude, soon over, soon regretted.” What fellow Tory Enoch Powell got wrong when he predicted foaming rivers of blood as Britain collapsed into racist rioting, Johnson argued, was to underestimate British tolerance. The corollary? “[P]rovided we have a reasonable legal framework for minimising the problem – like the infrastructure to remove sewage – we could probably achieve the same results, if not better, if we axed large chunks of the anti-racism industry, stopped taxing people with the threat of legal action, and left a bit more of the struggle against racism to tolerance and common sense.” Again, how that would work was left obscure. Nonetheless, rolling back the frontiers of the state thus is classic Boris. “The trick of the next few years,” Johnson wrote in 2005, “will be to show that you can have compassionate politics that are for the benefit of business and enterprise, and that you can gradually bear down on taxation and spending in a way that is good for everyone.” That trick, as you may have noticed a decade on, has not really been pulled off by David Cameron. Perhaps Johnson could succeed where our current prime minister and his chancellor have failed? Stop looking at me sceptically. The model for the minimal state Johnson admires comes from his study of the Roman empire. “We would surely want the laissez-faire government of the high empire, in which the economy grew and people prospered with nominal bureaucracy and regulation,” he wrote in The Dream of Rome. Yes, there was slavery, but otherwise, if only the European Union had been more like the Roman empire, Johnson would no doubt have been sharing a remain platform with Cameron rather than trying to inflict on the prime minister his biggest humiliation since revelations about that thing he allegedly did to a pig’s head. Near the end of The Dream of Rome, the Eton-educated Latinist argued: “It would be good to recapture that enormous public-spirited creative energy of the Romans, to say nothing of the efficiency that allowed them to rule an empire of 80 million with 150 officials.” But we latter-day Europeans cannot hope to emulate imperial Rome. Why not? To understand why the European Union can never repeat its glories, I read chapter 20 of The Churchill Factor, Johnson’s bestselling 2014 romp through the life of his political hero. There, on page 297, Johnson goes back to 1950 and the British parliamentary debate about the Schuman plan – the offer of the French foreign minister that Britain join talks on creating a supranational body to oversee common European markets in coal and steel. “The clay is wet. The mould has yet to set,” wrote Johnson breathlessly. “Now is the moment when Britain could have intervened decisively; accepted the invitation from France – and jointly seized the steering wheel.” But, Johnson argued, it didn’t. Years, later, once the clay was dry and the mould had firmly set, Britain belatedly joined the EEC (forerunner of the EU). By then the steering wheel was under Franco-German control; the British could only complain from the back, like sulky children, about the direction the continent was heading. If only, Johnson suggests, Churchill had been prime minister in 1950, Britain would have become a leading member of the European Coal and Steel Community and thus been in the driving seat. That, Johnson argued, was what Churchill, as leader of the opposition sought, but shortsighted socialists pooh-poohed. Had they not, then, Britain might have helped create a European Union fit for purpose – one that Boris Johnson, at least, would not have campaigned for us to leave. If Johnson’s writings are worth reading, it is not for his policy proposals, any of which he could renege upon before breakfast, but for such intriguing “what ifs” – the counterfactual history of Britain. For all that Johnson eulogises Churchill, he does not see his clay as from the same mould as his hero’s. While The Churchill Factor is blurbed as “essential reading for those who want to know what makes a great leader”, Johnson admits that “as a politician I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his shoes”. A latchet, apparently, is a narrow thong for fastening a sandal. Did Churchill ever wear sandals? Frankly I don’t know. What I do know, from reading these books, is that it is not great men who are leading us to Brexit, not latter-day Churchills, but the most chilling British double act since Little and Large."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-energy-edf-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T10:07:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power's broken promises means EDF deal is a delusional dream | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-energy-edf-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-energy-edf-deal","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power's broken promises means EDF deal is a delusional dream","bodyText":"Energy efficiency is cheapest and the cost of renewable energy is falling. In contrast, gas prices have risen by 50% in five years and the cost of nuclear energy has trebled since 2008. Yet the UK government today staked a large part of the nation's energy future on the latter, by agreeing a deal with EDF which might lead to them building a new nuclear power station. Ministers have not backed the favourite, or even a speedy but erratic outsider: they have backed a horse running in reverse. The 60-year history of the nuclear industry is one unblemished by promises kept. From \"too cheap to meter\" to safe as houses, every pledge has been broken. When the UK government once again fell for the renewed vows of the nuclear industry in 2008, they were promised reactors would cost £2.8bn to build. Today's deal shows the cost is now £8bn. They were promised electricity for £31-42 per megawatt-hour: today's price is £92.50/MWh. The trashed guarantees stack up as steadily as the toxic waste pile that already costs billions a year to store. In 2007, David Cameron said: \"The problems of nuclear waste have to be dealt with to make any new investment possible.\" In January 2013, Cumbria, the only place in the running for a permanent disposal site rejected the idea. The government pledge that the private sector would build the new reactors has collapsed too: EDF is owned by the French state and can only move ahead itself with about 40% of the money stumped up by China. The final crushed commitment comes from the 2010 coalition agreement: New nuclear power stations \"will receive no public subsidy\". If forcing energy consumers to pay roughly £38bn above the current cost of electricity is not a subsidy, what is? If a government package of insurance against accidents and loan guarantees is not a subsidy, what is? This farrago of fictions matters. EDF and the government say the deal protects the public against the near-certainty of broken promises on costs. But read the small print: \"The strike price could be adjusted, upwards or downwards, in relation to operational and certain other costs.\" Perhaps the government could bail out of the deal if the costs soared? No: \"Hinkley Point C would be protected from being curtailed without appropriate compensation.\" If new risks came to light increasing the cost of insurance, could we get out then? No: \"Protection would be provided for any increases in nuclear insurance costs as a result of withdrawal of government cover.\" No wonder opponents are terrified by the lack of any independent scrutiny to date of the deal struck by the government. The nuclear industry has captured the government as comprehensively as the big six energy companies have captured the domestic energy market. Don't forget that just 48 hours after the Fukushima catastrophe, government officials were working with the industry to play down the terrible events - before they had even unfolded. The alternative to nuclear, made to appear unthinkable by the industry's lobbying, is in fact far from inconceivable. A huge effort to improve the UK's woeful energy efficiency is the first step. The UK government currently expects electricity demand to rise by 33-66% by 2050. Why? Germany predicts a 25% cut. That's how to seriously cut energy bills and the carbon emissions driving climate change: by not having to generate power in the first place. It also happens to create thousands of jobs in every part of the UK, unlike the government's failing green deal energy efficiency programme, which is actually killing jobs. The second step is a genuine commitment to renewable energy, youthful technologies ripe for further cost reductions in stark contrast to nuclear. Even today, once you account for the much longer time for which nuclear is promised subsidies, offshore wind costs the same and it will fall. Yet the ambition for 40GW of offshore wind by 2020, which can be built five times faster than nuclear, is being shredded. The subsidies on offer to up to eight nuclear power stations could build that 40GW twice over, though the money has to be spent up front. Gas would also play an important transitional role, in the absence of nuclear power. Cameron today said the Hinkley nuclear deal was an example of \"our new industrial policy that looks to the future\". It is the precise reverse. With its long and lousy track record, it is little wonder that even the sober thinkers at the Economist concluded that \"nuclear is the dream that failed\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/jan/31/sellafield-shutdown-science-as-horror","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-31T16:06:48Z","webTitle":"The Sellafield shutdown raises the spectre of science as horror | Jonathan Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/31/sellafield-shutdown-science-as-horror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/31/sellafield-shutdown-science-as-horror","fields":{"headline":"The Sellafield shutdown raises the spectre of science as horror","bodyText":"This eerie picture of Sellafield by night shows why it is almost impossible to be rational about nuclear energy. As the nuclear reprocessing plant in north-west England announced a partial shutdown while it investigated a high-radiation reading, our atomic fears once again mushroomed. There's something unreal about this photograph: it evokes science-fiction images of alien phenomena infiltrating the natural landscape of Cumbria. Behold a place where dark deeds are done deep inside the atom. We've seen the film before, so many times – from cold-war newsreels to 1970s Doctor Who. Indeed, the iconography of \"science as horror\" that haunts this photograph is far older than nuclear power itself. This hi-tech nocturne closely resembles Phillipe Jacques de Loutherbourg's 1801 painting Coalbrookdale by Night, which sees one of the great centres of the Industrial Revolution as a hellish workshop whose fires luridly illuminate a ruined countryside. Ever since the birth of industry 200 years ago, humanity's power to operate on nature has provoked as much revulsion as pride. No dark satanic mills of the 19th century, however, provoked the unique dread this picture illuminates, for nuclear energy breeds nightmares that have arrested its development. Every accident slows down the building of power stations, as the pro-nuclear environmentalist James Lovelock has observed. There is a case to be made – as Lovelock and other dissident Greens insist – for nuclear power as an alternative to carbon fuels. Whatever the truth or otherwise of that case, the outrage such opinions provoke arguably has an element of the irrational and this picture explains why. Nuclear power is a myth as much as a reality, a shadow in the modern mind. The first images of nuclear reactions that lodged themselves in the world's imagination were mushroom clouds. The first we heard of \"splitting the bomb\" was news of a slaughter. This photograph is of nothing more than a spookily lit industrial plant – but it carries a massive weight of terror in which de Loutherbourg's devilish Coalbrookdale merges with Andy Warhol's silkscreen atomic explosion. If defenders of nuclear energy are right, the gothic imagination that feasts on images such as this prevents us from making rational choices. As of writing, Sellafield said the high emissions it detected were after all the result of \"natural background radiation\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/09/george-osborne-is-saving-green-pennies-but-spending-nuclear-pounds","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T19:30:40Z","webTitle":"George Osborne is saving green pennies, but spending nuclear pounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/09/george-osborne-is-saving-green-pennies-but-spending-nuclear-pounds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/09/george-osborne-is-saving-green-pennies-but-spending-nuclear-pounds","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne is saving green pennies, but spending nuclear pounds","bodyText":"In the world of renewable energy, they are still reeling from the budget shocker – the removal of the climate change levy exemption, a source of revenue that had seemed secure for at least another half-decade. To see the value of these exception certificates, look at the effect on the share price of Drax, which qualified by virtue of converting two of its six units to burn biomass rather than coal: down 28% on the day, followed by a rebound of only 7% on Thursday. The company calculates that the change will cost it £60m next year, prompting analysts to cut their profit forecasts by about a quarter. “We are surprised and disappointed at this retrospective change to a support regime which has been in place since 2001 specifically to encourage green energy and support renewable investment,” said Dorothy Thompson, the Drax chief executive. She’s not the only one to feel that way. “We are disappointed by the several recent changes to the regulatory framework which will disincentivise long-term investment in the build-out of new energy infrastructure in the UK,” said Eric Machiels, boss of Infinis, which is big in onshore wind and suffered a Drax-style share price fall. Why did George Osborne do it? The official answer is to stop “taxpayer money benefiting electricity generation abroad”. Well, OK, but the share prices show he is also stopping a benefit to companies that very definitely generate in the UK. However it’s dressed up, it seems to be an old-fashioned grab designed to keep a lid on the government’s projected bill for encouraging renewables. But if cost is the worry, the chancellor ought to look elsewhere. How on earth does Hinkley Point, the £24bn nuclear power station planned for Somerset, continue to escape the Treasury’s scrutiny? When up and running, Hinkley Point will generate 3.2GW of energy. For £24bn, you could build enough gas-fired stations to produce 50GW, calculates Peter Atherton, analyst at Jefferies. The economics of Hinkley Point only make sense if the oil price is somewhere around $200 a barrel, as opposed to $60 currently. And, if the chancellor really has an objection to paying foreign generators, he should reflect that, while Hinkley Point is on British soil, the biggest financial winners from the generous inflation-linked contracts underwritten by UK taxpayers will be EdF, part-owned by the French state, and its Chinese partners. Hinkley Point may good for security of energy supply, but, in financial terms, the chancellor is pinching pennies from conventional renewables while squandering pounds on nuclear. The government should look again at Hinkley Point. Magic McFarlane? John McFarlane, the new Barclays chairman and its even-newer stand-in chief executive, is an ambitious chap. He told staff this week that he is aiming to double the share price in the next few years. That implies getting back to 520p, last seen in late 2007, just after the fall of Northern Rock. The quickest way to put a rocket under the shares would be to sell the investment bank for a princely sum. Investors don’t trust the division and it is dragging down Barclays’ share price. But that’s not the plan. McFarlane told the FT he’s committed to having a strong investment bank and will unveil his ideas soon. In other words, he wants to take another crack at making the numbers work. Good luck, but almost nobody is making consistently strong returns in investment banking these days – apart from the bankers themselves, of course, which is half the problem. Another problem is that UK regulators – understandably – are more suspicious of investment banking than their US counterparts. Clawback rules on bonuses, we are constantly told, are stricter here, creating recruitment headaches when Wall Street banks are on the prowl. If McFarlane thinks he has discovered a magic formula, we’re all ears. Just don’t expect shareholders to applaud instantly a strategy of being less conservative. Wasn’t that how it all went wrong for Barclays in the first place? HSBC hotseat Thank goodness somebody in parliament has remembered that there is unfinished business with Stephen Green. Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, will give evidence to the House of Lords economic affairs committee next Tuesday and, let’s hope, will be asked questions that should have been posed in the last parliament. For example: why did HSBC seemingly ignore warnings from US authorities that its operations in Mexico, acquired in 2002, were a hotbed of money laundering by local drug cartels? HSBC eventually paid a fine of $1.9bn in 2012 and agreed a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice. And how much scrutiny did Green, as the boss, apply to the Swiss unit? Did he think he had any direct responsibility for ensuring that customers were paying their tax bills and complying with money-laundering regulations? And did HSBC bosses ever have any hope of knowing what was happening in their empire? In 1998 the bank had 25m customers; by 2003 it had 110m. If the place was too big to manage, why did Green say in 2009 that rivals had “profoundly damaged the industry’s reputation” when he couldn’t be sure HSBC’s record was clean? The advance notice from the economics affairs committee suggests that all these subjects will be covered. Don’t hold back, Lord Hollick, committee chairman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2015/oct/30/regional-slant-on-the-northern-powerhouse","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-30T18:15:23Z","webTitle":"Regional slant on the northern powerhouse | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/30/regional-slant-on-the-northern-powerhouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/oct/30/regional-slant-on-the-northern-powerhouse","fields":{"headline":"Regional slant on the northern powerhouse","bodyText":"Helen Pidd reports that at the local government select committee on Monday Kieran Quinn, the Labour leader of Tameside council, praised George Osborne for being “very clever in as much as he has been able to bully, cajole, persuade other ministerial colleagues to give up some of their powers” (Labour should seize the day on elected mayors, 28 October). Other Labour council leaders throughout the north are lining up for what they see as more powers coming their way from Osborne’s “northern powerhouse”. What is lacking is any democratic involvement in these devolution agreements. Pidd reports that Greater Manchester “gains control over the region’s £6bn health and social care budget”. So who will get the blame for cuts in health and social care? Labour council leaders. We need an open, transparent and considered debate on democratic devolution. Administrative devolution behind closed doors runs the risk of bringing the whole principle of devolution into disrepute. David Melvin Ashton-under-Lyne • Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, says the northern powerhouse will not become a reality without a generation of investment in the infrastructure and human capital in the area, including education and training, and points to low productivity and under-utilisation of the work-force leading to high levels of poverty and disadvantage (Report, 27 October). But better education and training programmes, even investment in developing infrastructure and innovative projects, cannot deliver the desired outcomes when power, influence and nearly all the best-paid jobs are stubbornly tied to London, denying the rest of the country the benefits of that earning and spending capacity for local economies. Unless and until there is some real regionalisation of the controlling bodies of public and private sector organisations, from government and its regulatory bodies, from corporations and the commercial sector, from the media (but thank you BBC for Salford Quays) and from major NGOs and charities, the unions and professional bodies, faith groups, regulatory bodies and all the big players that comprise the economy and organised society, there can never be anything to rival or compete with London in the UK. That’s why so many of our north-west graduates leave for jobs in the capital or overseas. Many who stay staff supermarket tills, coffee shops, bars and call centres – the only function commonly outsourced to the regions (where building and rental costs are lower): there are far fewer well-paid, senior and influential jobs “up north”. Delia Koczwara Manchester • George Osborne’s “northern powerhouse” policy is looking pretty useless in view of the government’s utter failure to protect steel workers against predatory pricing by their new “friends” in the Chinese Communist government, allowing two major steel processors to go bust in as many weeks. But even the Guardian pushed Jeremy Corbyn’s comments on the steel crisis to the bottom corner of page 17 – so much for your northern roots. Of course one of the steel firms was owned by an Indian company and the other by one from Thailand. Do we own anything now? And couldn’t the £20bn subsidy for the Chinese to build the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point be better used? David Reed London • Martin Kettle (The north awaits its own SNP, 30 October) is right that “political space” has opened up for a northern regionalist party – and there’s quite a lot happening already. At this year’s general election, Yorkshire First stood 14 candidates and averaged about 1% of the vote. The North East Party made a significant impact where it stood, while the Northern Party ran several candidates in Lancashire. Not a political earthquake, but winning votes of between 600 and 1,200 in a tightly fought election wasn’t bad. Yorkshire First has since won some local council seats and gained nearly 10% of the vote in a recent Barnsley council byelection, beating the Tories and coming within 25 votes of Ukip. What is emerging is the potential for a northern alliance between the three regions across the north. Yorkshire has the same population as Scotland and a very strong historic identity. As an economic unit, it makes sense too, unlike the “city regions” being imposed on us. Trying to force all the north, with a population of over 15 million, into a single political party might not be the way forward. But a progressive northern regionalism that works collaboratively across the north-east, Yorkshire and north-west could start to make real headway if it can tap into the growing discontent about the north’s neglect by a centralised state whose promised “devolution” to the English regions is a pale shadow of what Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and even London already have. There is scope for working with sympathetic politicians in the existing parties on a shared agenda which should include PR and elected regional assemblies. A new kind of northern regionalism is possible which can make common cause with the already devolved nations of the UK and develop a politics that is inclusive, democratic and enterprising. Professor Paul Salveson Yorkshire First parliamentary candidate for Colne Valley (2015) • Martin Kettle should get out more. One of the best plays about the north which played at the National was The Pitman Painters which started in Newcastle and then went to Broadway. There are things about the north which are better than the south – good local government which does involve people, and a good NHS which most people use – there is only a small private sector. It is a vision of a better society which I feel is best articulated by the Labour party. David Taylor-Gooby Peterlee, County Durham • Helen Pidd has missed the point in criticising the parliamentary Labour party for being less than enthusiastic about George Osborne’s idea for elected mayors for northern cities. Unlike the devolution deals bequeathed by the Labour government to Scotland, Wales and London, northerners are being offered considerably less – and with much greater risks at a time when falling house prices illustrate the flight of their local economies in the face of the chancellor’s austerity programme. Labour MPs are rightly wary of this chancellor, whom they see in action everyday, whereas ageing regional politicians can obviously see opportunity in ending their careers with a good pension in a mayoral contest that they can hardly lose, even though their share of the vote and their mandate will be minimal. Unlike London, northern citizens are not being offered a London-type assembly, which sharpens the focus of the Tory mayor. In the meantime, the citizens represented by other parties in Southport, Bolton, Huddersfield and countless communities across the north are hardly looking forward to seeing their localities subjugated to the careers of what will be in effect self-appointed gauleiters in the big cities with no direct accountability to voters at all. If Labour is to respond to Osborne’s idea, it should be offering the same level of democratic devolution as previously accorded to Scotland, Wales and London, via a directly elected northern assembly, through whose members, the elected mayors would be held to account. Dr Jim Ford Southport, Merseyside • It is strange how often commentators on questions of the north and south, such as Martin Kettle, forget that the compass has four points. The West Country, as far or further, than the “north” from London, gets lumped with the “south”. Yet its identity, cultures, economies, and places of all kinds, especially market and coastal towns, get lost in these national conversations. Cornwall, up there with the poorer areas of the EU; Devon, the heartland of organic farming; Somerset and its infamous Levels; Bristol and its green-tinged, ideas, laden, west-of-Britain difference; and then Dorset and Wiltshire, count but are so often voiceless in these conversations about a different future for Britain. A quick suggestion then: the Guardian should appoint a south-west correspondent, whose job will be to tell stories of the place of this part of England’s compass in a brighter future.

RenewableUK, the lobby group, said the changes would cost green energy producers around £450m in the current financial year, and up to £1bn by 2020-2021. The move hammered the share price of power generator Drax which is in the process of converting stations from burning coal to burning wood pellets. The company lost more than a quarter of its stock market value as it said the move would cost it £30m this year and £60m in 2016. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, described the budget as a “serious blow for the fight against climate change”, while Greenpeace said it showed the chancellor is out of step with the times. Osborne insisted the Conservative government would still continue to promote low carbon investment and would be pushing for a deal at United Nations talks in Paris later this year to limit global warming to 2C. But his budget measures included removing the CCL exemption from renewable electricity schemes and promised streamlining other taxes. “The government will review the business energy efficiency tax landscape and consider approaches to simplify and improve the effectiveness of the regime. A consultation will be launched in autumn 2015,” he said. Osborne also promised to bring forward proposals for a sovereign wealth fund for communities that host shale gas developments, to expand the North Sea investment, and cluster area allowances to include additional activities. Phil Grant, of management consultants Baringa Partners, said the budget was bad news for investors in green power. “Britain is a world leader in green energy but the abolishment of climate change levies for renewables is another blow for an already fragile sector. Investors were perturbed by recent decisions … to reduce subsidies for new renewable plants and we’ve seen the share prices of companies exposed to renewables take a further hit this afternoon.” Gordon Edge, RenewableUK’s director of policy, said that until now, Levy Exemption Certificates generated as a result of the CCL had provided vital financial support for renewable energy producers. “The government had already announced an end to future financial support for onshore wind – even though it’s the most cost-effective form of clean energy we have. Now they’re imposing retrospective cuts on projects already up and running across the entire clean energy sector. “Yet again the government is moving the goalposts, pushing some marginal projects from profit into loss. It’s another example of this government’s unfair, illogical and obsessive attacks on renewables”. Caroline Lucas said that axing the CCL exemption for renewable electricity, committing to further funding for road building, and doing nothing to push forward a low-carbon agenda more widely jeopardised progress on climate change. “We’ve seen yet another example of reckless short-term policy making that prioritises the profits of polluters over the public interest in a safe and habitable climate,” she added. Doug Parr, director of policy at Greenpeace, said Osborne was now taxing clean-power schemes as if they were fossil fuel. “This will make it more expensive for business to buy electricity from renewable power. He is man out of step with the times,” he added. But the move to review the impact of energy efficiency measures on bill payers was welcomed by the EEF, manufacturing employers organisation. “Fifteen years of layering and tinkering with policy has left us with a vast patchwork of expensive, inefficient and incoherent policy drivers for decarbonisation,” said the EEF’s director of policy, Paul Raynes. “We urgently need to revisit the policy landscape to reduce costs, improve the business environment and better deliver on our policy objective of reducing emissions,” he added. Meanwhile Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said the government wanted a sustainable, secure and affordable energy system but had introduced policy changes that took the UK away from that goal. “The ending of subsidies for onshore wind farms, our cheapest low-carbon electricity resource, the failure to exploit the potential of energy efficiency, the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for renewable energy, and support for unpopular fracking and extortionately expensive nuclear power does not add up to a credible energy policy,” she said adding: “It reduces the chances of us meeting our various legal requirements, and presents serious political risk to investors, which in itself makes energy more expensive.” Sam Fankhauser, a professor and deputy director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics, said the move on renewable electricity compromised the effectiveness of the Climate Change Levy as a form of carbon pricing. But he believed a review of green taxes could be constructive: “UK energy taxes can and should be reformed to make them less burdensome for businesses, deliver increased revenues for HM Treasury and reduce carbon emissions more efficiently. For instance, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreement can be combined into one single instrument.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/14/sellafield-nuclear-waste-storage-safety-limit-relaxed","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T10:58:57Z","webTitle":"Sellafield nuclear waste storage safety limit relaxed following accident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/14/sellafield-nuclear-waste-storage-safety-limit-relaxed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/14/sellafield-nuclear-waste-storage-safety-limit-relaxed","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield nuclear waste storage safety limit relaxed following accident","bodyText":"Safety limits on the storage of some of the world’s most dangerous nuclear wastes at Sellafield in Cumbria have been relaxed after an accident knocked out a treatment plant. The government’s safety watchdog, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), has permitted the private company that runs Sellafield to breach legal restrictions on the amount of hot, high-level radioactive waste that can be kept in tanks. The limits are likely to be exceeded by up to 350 tonnes between April 2014 and July 2016. Critics accused ONR of breaking their promises and putting Sellafield’s profits before safety. But ONR insisted there was “minimal hazard increase”, while Sellafield said it put safety first. The waste storage limits, imposed in 2001, were meant to reduce stocks to below 5,500 tonnes of uranium equivalent by July 2015. The aim was to minimise the risk of a disaster spreading a plume of potentially lethal radioactive contamination over the UK and Ireland – officially regarded as Sellafield’s “worst credible accident”. The liquid waste comes from Britain’s nuclear power stations and generates significant amounts of heat. It has to be constantly cooled and stirred to prevent it from overheating. Sellafield asked for permission to breach the storage limits to help cope with a backlog caused by an accident in November 2013. A plant meant to solidify the waste to make it safer lost power, suffered “gross contamination” and had to be closed for 11 months. The alternative to exceeding the storage limits was to temporarily close a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield that separates out the waste. But this would mean operating the plant for two or three years beyond 2018, when it is due to shut for good, placing extra strain on ageing downstream facilities, ONR said. In a redacted report, ONR accepted that breaching the waste storage limits for 16 months would lead to a “modest increase in hazard”. But it concluded that temporarily shutting the reprocessing plant would be more risky, and so has replaced the limits with a weaker “operating rule” administered by Sellafield. Gordon Thompson, executive director of the US Institute for Resource and Security Studies and an expert on Sellafield, pointed out that the site’s liquid high-level wastes were “one of the world’s major concentrations of radiological hazard”. He accused ONR of breaking a promise made in 2001 to halt reprocessing if necessary to ensure that waste stocks were reduced. Reprocessing fuel from Britain’s newer reactors was “unnecessary, uneconomic, and hazardous,” he argued. “It compounds the waste problem, threatens international security, and never should have begun.” Martin Forward, from the local anti-nuclear group, Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (CORE), attacked ONR for “its apparent willingness to put Sellafield’s business interests before those of health and safety”. Public confidence in the regulator’s competence would “sink to an all-time low”, he claimed. Trusting Sellafield to comply with the new operating rule to control waste stocks was like asking a fox to guard chickens, he said. “ONR’s tight regulation of a highly hazardous nuclear industry seems to have gone out of the window.” ONR stressed that reducing risks at Sellafield was its “number one regulatory priority”. Over the past 14 years it had made “substantial progress” in decreasing high-level waste stocks, it said. “Allowing Sellafield to operate with highly active liquor (HAL) stocks slightly above the level previously specified will result in minimal hazard increase and a negligible increase in risk,” said ONR’s Sellafield director, Andy Lindley. “Our position on HAL stocks is fully justified in maintaining a focus on hazard and risk reduction across the site. Replacing the specification with the new operating rule provides adequate regulatory control and the date for bulk HAL removal remains unchanged.” Sellafield, run by a company involving three multinationals, Amec, Areva and URS, strongly denied that it put business before safety. “The safety and security of the Sellafield site is our number one priority and we never compromise on that commitment,” said a company spokesman. “We would point out that there has been a three-fold reduction in HAL stocks since the introduction of the specification in 2001. Furthermore, the operating rule will ensure continued year on year hazard reduction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/nov/23/frankie-boyle-fallout-paris-psychopathic-autopilot","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-23T19:06:54Z","webTitle":"Frankie Boyle on Paris attacks: ‘This is the worst time for society to go on psychopathic autopilot’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/23/frankie-boyle-fallout-paris-psychopathic-autopilot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/23/frankie-boyle-fallout-paris-psychopathic-autopilot","fields":{"headline":"Frankie Boyle on Paris attacks: ‘This is the worst time for society to go on psychopathic autopilot’","bodyText":"There were a lot of tributes after the horror in Paris. It has to be said that Trafalgar Square is an odd choice of venue to show solidarity with France; presumably Waterloo was too busy. One of the most appropriate tributes was Adele dedicating Hometown Glory to Paris, just as the raids on St-Denis started. A song about south London where, 10 years ago, armed police decided to hysterically blow the face off a man just because he was a bit beige. In times of crisis, we are made to feel we should scrutinise our government’s actions less closely, when surely that’s when we should pay closest attention. There’s a feeling that after an atrocity history and context become less relevant, when surely these are actually the worst times for a society to go on psychopathic autopilot. Our attitudes are fostered by a society built on ideas of dominance, where the solution to crises are force and action, rather than reflection and compromise. If that sounds unbearably drippy, just humour me for a second and imagine a country where the response to Paris involved an urgent debate about how to make public spaces safer and marginalised groups less vulnerable to radicalisation. Do you honestly feel safer with a debate centred around when we can turn some desert town 3,000 miles away into a sheet of glass? Of course, it’s not as if the west hasn’t learned any lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. This time round, no one’s said out loud that we’re going to win. People seem concerned to make sure that Islam gets its full share of the blame, so we get the unedifying circus of neocons invoking God as much as the killers. “Well, Isis say they’re motivated by God.” Yes, and people who have sex with their pets say they’re motivated by love, but most of us don’t really believe them. Not that I’m any friend of religion – let’s blame religion for whatever we can. Let’s blame anyone who invokes the name of any deity just because they want to ruin our weekend, starting with TGI Friday’s. The ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, evaded detection by security services by having a name too long to fit into one tweet. How could the most stringent surveillance in the world not have picked up Abdelhamid Abaaoud before? I mean, they’d have got him even if they just went through lists of terrorists alphabetically. We’re always dealing with terror in retrospect – like stocking up on Imodium rather than reading the cooking instructions on your mini kievs. The truth is that modern governments sit at the head of a well-funded security apparatus. They are told that foreign military adventures put domestic populations at risk and they give them the thumbs up anyway. Charitably, the safety of their populations just aren’t of great concern to them. Realistically, domestic terrorist attacks play into their agenda: they allow them to grab ever more authoritarian powers with which to police their increasingly unequal and volatile societies. Of course, no one wants to believe that our government isn’t interested in our safety, just like everyone really wanted to believe that Jimmy Savile cared about whether kids got to meet Duran Duran. It’s not an insult to the dead to wonder why France, a $2tn economy, couldn’t make a better offer to its disenfranchised youth than a bunch of sick bullies grooming them on the internet. It’s not apologism to try to understand why something happened. When Syria’s drought kicked in, 25% of the population became unemployed. The vast majority of the country’s livestock has died over the past decade. A lot of Isis are farmers with nowhere to go, their entire industry destroyed – you’d think they’d have more sympathy for journalists. Those who think radicalising a youngster has nothing to do with climate – have you seen Tatooine? No one is saying climate change causes terrorism. Stop thinking that a global death cult is caused by one thing – it’s a complex situation involving several different countries and ideologies, not a rattling sound in your washing machine. Personally, I think that for all our blaming religion, there will be peace in the Middle East when the oil runs out. But knowing their luck, then somebody will invent a way of making fuel by mixing sand and falafel. Maybe the west’s approach is right. After all, if you’ve got a massive fight in, say, a pub car park, the best way of solving it is clearly standing well back and randomly lobbing in fireworks. You can’t get rid of an ideology by destroying its leaders; you’d think if there’s anything “Christian” countries should know, it’s that. Europe has rejected the death penalty on moral grounds, and yet we relax this view when it comes to a group who want to be martyred. You can’t bomb ideas. If your kid shits on the carpet, you can’t stop them by bombing the person who invented shit – though it would tidy up ITV’s Saturday night schedule. Andrew Neil went viral with an impassioned eulogy that, like most eulogies, was just inaccurate nonsense in the form of nice memorable words strung together with angry sad words. A speech that would have made those named within it proud, but only because a good few of them were nihilistic absurdists. Listing the great French thinkers in a tribute to nuclear power showcased the worst aspect of historical fame: these were figures Neil could name but appeared to know nothing about. For a list supporting the French government’s foray into bombing its former colony he chose Satie, a composer so questioning of state he put a question mark into La Marseillaise; Zola, a man so adamant about the function of a fair and full trial he may have been murdered for his beliefs; Rousseau – “Those who think themselves masters of others are greater slaves than they”; Ravel, who rejected all state honours; Gauguin, a passionate defender of indigenous peoples; and Camus, the great Algerian-born philosopher, who died in 1960, a year before he would’ve been thrown into the Seine at the orders of the Nazi head of the Parisian police. Out of his list of peacenik, thoughtful, anti-government icons, one of the few who might have been in favour of bombing Syria was Sartre, and that’s only because he thought we were all dead anyway. Of course, we mustn’t forget Coco Chanel, who Neil threw on to the list in such a blatant “if we don’t include a woman we’ll get into trouble” rush, he didn’t notice a quick wiki would reveal her to be a Nazi spy. These are the people who made France great, because what they asked of France was to question, to look death in the eye, to commit to full trials and never resort to military force, to step away from government, away from indigenous lands, to never see themselves as superior, and most, most of all, for people to stop regurgitating rhetorical cliches and think for themselves. Neil asked us to consider who will be remembered in 1,000 years, and the answer of course is Thkkkkkkkzzzzxrrkksd, the insane Cockroach Emperor, who revolutionised the mining of our bones for fuel. But let’s go with his conceit. A thousand years is a long time; the first book published in French wasn’t until 1476. Goodness knows what an Islamic caliphate would have been doing 1,000 years ago? They built the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, one of the first universities in the world; they asked scholars of all faiths to translate every text ever written into Arabic; they demanded the first qualifications for doctors, founded the first psychiatric hospitals and invented ophthalmology. They developed algebra (algorithms are named after their Arab father) and a programmable machine … a computer. They introduced Aristotle to Europe, Al-Jahiz began theories of natural selection, they discovered the Andromeda galaxy, classified the spinal nerves and created hydropower using pumps and gears. And Neil is right – we don’t remember any of that. Not to say that this is what Isis want – Isis are like the group that closed the House of Wisdom, the next caliphate who decided science was irreligious. Isis want to destroy the knowledge that Islam is a beautiful, scientific and intelligent culture, and we are way ahead of them. We want Paris to be remembered in 1,000 years and we don’t remember the names of the victims 10 minutes after reading them – we don’t remember Amine Ibnolmobarak, a Moroccan émigré who was designing an architectural solution to the 2,000 deaths at Mecca; we don’t remember Elsa Delplace and her mother Patricia San Martin, who died shielding Delplace’s young son from bullets. We remember that the female terrorist was blond and one had no pants on. We remember that the terrorists came in with refugees even though they don’t seem to have done, especially since they were all French or Belgian. We expect our descendants to remember Daft Punk and we don’t even remember that invading Iraq caused the birth and rise of Isis. And we won’t remember any of this once the new series of Britain’s Got Talent starts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2015/mar/31/weekly-letters-climate-change-dalai-lama-tibet-quebec","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-31T11:16:44Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 3 April 2015","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/31/weekly-letters-climate-change-dalai-lama-tibet-quebec","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2015/mar/31/weekly-letters-climate-change-dalai-lama-tibet-quebec","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 3 April 2015","bodyText":"The climate change fight Mark Lynas is quite wrong when he claims that the scientific community’s consensus on global warming is similar to one on nuclear power and GM crops (20 March). There is significant opposition to nuclear power amongst a broad range of eminent scientists, from the physical, biological and medical scientists, and this has been the case for decades. We are not significantly closer to solving the problem of radioactive waste than we were in the 1950s, and as Lucens, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima have shown, nuclear “accidents” must be expected. The same is true of GM crops. Evidence is now emerging of high residues of pesticides in GM crops, in addition to an extensive history of contamination of other crops. In each of these cases, just as in the case of climate change, the driving force is the quest for profit, regardless of the (unintended) consequences and costs. The common thread is that we live in a finite natural world and have embraced an ideology that requires permanent growth, something that is patently a physical impossibility. If stating that makes me an “extremist”, so be it. Scientific facts are not decided by polls. I Bokor Armidale, NSW, Australia • As a mediator working with conflict in groups and organisations, my job is to offer disputants a neutral framing – a description of the issue that expands their thinking, promotes curiosity and offers a safe space for examining divergent perspectives. Respect for disputants and, strangely, the conflict itself, is key to creating a safe space for a productive conversation. Within such a framing, needs can be addressed, objective criteria brought to bear on the discussion, and values mutually heard and respected. For proponents of market-based solutions and those in favour of more community-based models to have a productive conversation as opposed to a shouting match, a safe space grounded in respect needs to be offered. If Lynas truly wishes to encourage people climbing “out of their trenches” and “working together” he is going about it in a strange way. Calling one or both sides “extremist” is hardly likely to yield anything productive. Rather than promoting dialogue as Lynas claims, it suggests a desire to push one side entirely out of the space of politically acceptable discourse. We associate the word “extremist” with blowing up installations and taking hostages. Now suddenly this term is being applied to people who question capitalism as a viable model in the era of climate change. Ana Simeon Victoria, British Columbia, Canada • Climate change and the drive to seek refuge are indeed not new. Not only is the primary driving force now one of human making, but for the first time in history we know what’s around the corner. Older societies in the Levant, on Pacific islands, in the US south-west and on the Yucatan that faced drought, sea-level rise, and other climate-induced changes never saw what was coming. We do. Thanks to science. Antony R Berger Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada Dalai Lama’s Tibetan stance Alan Williams-Key writes that the Dalai Lama is “an advocate for an independent Tibet” (Reply, 20 March). That is not correct. What the Dalai Lama has been advocating for the past 35 years is the well-named Middle Way policy. In 1979, the late Chinese paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, proposed to the Dalai Lama that “except independence, all other issues can be resolved through negotiations”. This was immediately welcomed by the Dalai Lama who, after consulting with many people, changed the policy of restoring Tibet’s independence to that of the Middle Way approach which seeks genuine autonomy, within the framework of the People’s Republic of China, for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet. To date, the response from the Chinese leadership has been to label the Dalai Lama as a “violent separatist”. George Farley Merricks Beach, Victoria, Australia UK surveillance oversight The article concerning surveillance laws needing a total overhaul (20 March) reports that the prime minister, David Cameron, made a statement saying that the intelligence services commissioner, Sir Mark Waller, would be given “statutory powers of oversight of use of bulk personal datasets”. Is it too much to expect that a man educated at Eton and Oxford would know that an oversight is defined in the Oxford dictionary not only as: “supervision”, but also as “omission or failure to see or notice”, and that this second definition is the one that is most used in modern parlance? Felicity Oliver Ostermundigen, Switzerland Humour about Quebec I found Mali Ilse Paquin’s piece about Sugar Sammy: Quebec’s ‘federal clown’ (20 March) both entertaining and informative, but the adverse reactions of some Québécois to his humour is curious when one considers the immense popularity of Michel Beaudet’s Tete A Claques animated sketches in which the characters spoke the most hilarious Franglais in a stereotypical Quebec accent. Soon after its launch in 2006 Tete A Claques received 1m hits a day. Perhaps the difference is that the Québécois tolerate, and even appreciate, self-deprecatory humour by a native son, but find similar humour by a foreigner, although born and raised in their midst, to be offensive. Pity! George Bruce Levine Ottawa, Canada Australia’s refugee problem Thank you, Guardian Weekly, for continuing to shed a light on the dark place which is Australia’s treatment of refugees (Australia’s turning back of asylum boats a ‘moral failure’, 20 March). While most Australians do not read the Weekly but instead the Murdoch newspapers that follow the government’s hard line in demonising refugees and presenting them as a potential security threat, a large number are ashamed by the cruel and “illegal” policy as defined by international law. An organisation called We’re Better Than This (wbttaus.org) was started by some prominent Australians and deserves support. The distinguished QC Julian Burnside, who has fought tirelessly for refugee rights, has stated that Australians have less to fear from a few desperate people fleeing for their lives than from a government that is prepared to lie, act in secret and have little regard for international opinion. Margaret Wilkes Cottesloe, Western Australia Briefly • Your headline Richard III comes home at last (27 March) is provocative. Many people believed his remains should have been returned to York Minster, since he was the last king of the House of York, instead of being re-interred in the cathedral of the city that had used his bones as hardcore for a car park. But if Leicester could not provide an appropriate geographical context for the event, they could surely have attempted to provide a historical one. I had expected at the very least that one of the horses drawing the hearse would have had a placard round its neck, “Sorry I’m late.” Alan Williams-Key Madrid, Spain • Jonathan Powell’s question to why we don’t have the strong and inspirational world leaders we all yearn for (20 March), is answered a few pages back in Oliver Burkeman’s This column will change your life, where he says that evolution “is all about mediocrity”, not a “progression towards greatness”, thus implying that the terrible are, if we’re lucky, replaced by the “sufficiently non-terrible”. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada • The review of Steve Fraser’s The Age of Acquiescence (13 March) refers to “a limpid legislative response” as if that were a bad thing.

Among the options outlined in a proposal by the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) is a new decommissioning unit that is financially independent of Tepco. Another option is the formation of a government-affiliated administrative agency. The proposal comes amid mounting criticism of Tepco's handling of problems at the plant, including leaks of radioactive water. The firm is expected to begin removing 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from the remains of the reactor No 4 building towards the middle of next month. Some nuclear experts have warned that even a slight mishap involving the fuel rods could result in huge releases of radiation into the air and sea. Shunichi Tanaka, the head of Japan's nuclear regulation authority, warned that the work would be more hazardous than usual because of debris that fell into the reactors storage pool during hydrogen explosions in March 2011. \"It's a totally different operation than removing normal fuel rods from a spent fuel pool,\" Tanaka said. \"They need to be handled extremely carefully and closely monitored. You should never rush or force them out, or they may break. I'm much more worried about this than I am about contaminated water.\" Toyoshi Fuketa, a senior member of the authority, said the fuel rod removal would mark a \"major step towards decommissioning\". This week Tepco released a video explaining its plan to remove the rods, which were being stored in a pool 100ft above ground when the plant was struck by the 11 March 2011 tsunami. Three other reactors suffered core meltdowns in the disaster, forcing the evacuation of 160,000 people in the area. A remote-controlled crane installed inside the reinforced reactor building will perform the delicate task of removing the spent fuel, Tepco said in its video. One by one, the fuel assemblies will be lifted out of storage and placed in dry casks before being moved to a common cooling pool in an adjacent building. \"This transfer from one form of underwater storage to another will not lead to any radiation exposure to workers or anyone else,\" the company said. Tepco hopes to complete the job by the end of next year before clearing out other fuel pools. Work to remove molten fuel from deep inside three other damaged reactors is not expected to start until 2020. The LDP panel, which will present its report to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, next week, reportedly favours the creation of a special unit to focus on decommissioning while the rest of the company is left to generate electricity for 29m homes and businesses in Tokyo and surrounding areas. Tepco is hoping to receive the go-ahead to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the biggest atomic facility in the world, in Niigata prefecture early next year. The firm believes that if all seven of the plant's reactors were restarted it could save $1bn (£623m) a month on fuel costs. Niigata's governor, Hirohiko Izumida, has not ruled out a restart, but says the firm must first address its culture of \"institutionalised lying\", citing the firm's belated admission in July that the plant was leaking radioactive water into the Pacific ocean. \"If they don't do what needs to be done, if they keep skimping on costs and manipulating information, they can never be trusted,\"Izumida said. The company faces a multibillion-dollar bill for compensating evacuees. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take around 30 years and cost at least ¥100bn (£634m). The utility, which has lost $27bn since March 2011, was effectively nationalised last year after the government injected ¥1tn of public funds. On Thursday, Japan's deputy prime minister and minister of finance, Taro Aso, hinted that the government would step in to fund the decontamination of towns and villages in the evacuation zone around the plant. Tepco is currently required to repay the government for decontamination costs but has reportedly asked for exemption from the payments, which one study has put at as much as ¥5tn. Aso said: \"I wonder if we can put all the blame on Tepco, given that nuclear policy was framed by the national government.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/sep/27/if-this-scandal-goes-beyond-vw-the-wheels-will-come-off-an-entire-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-27T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"If this scandal goes beyond VW, the wheels will come off an entire industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/27/if-this-scandal-goes-beyond-vw-the-wheels-will-come-off-an-entire-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/sep/27/if-this-scandal-goes-beyond-vw-the-wheels-will-come-off-an-entire-industry","fields":{"headline":"If this scandal goes beyond VW, the wheels will come off an entire industry","bodyText":"Everyone does it. These are the words that have often sparked history’s great corporate scandals. Companies or industries become detached from reality, and illegal or improper practices become seen as normal. It eventually ends in disaster. This was the case for traders and Libor, and now it could be the case for the automotive industry. At present, only Volkswagen has admitted using a “defeat device” to rig emissions tests on diesel engines. Other leading carmakers, such as BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, have fiercely denied manipulating data. However, the slide in the shares of all carmakers last week suggests that many people aren’t so sure. Whether other carmakers are dragged into the scandal or not, the events of the last week will have a profound impact on the automotive world. First, VW – the world’s biggest vehicle manufacturer – is going to change dramatically. While the scandal may be rooted in an industry-wide disdain for emissions tests, it is no coincidence that VW has been caught first and on such a grand scale. The revelations have shone a light on how dysfunctional the carmaker has become and the lengths it went to in a bid to succeed in the US. Based in Wolfsburg, 350 miles from Munich and 150 miles from Berlin, VW seems to have become ignorant of the world around it. The Porsche and Piech families own the majority of VW, with Lower Saxony and Qatar also holding substantial stakes. This small base of shareholders allowed VW to become increasingly insular and aloof. It was also the personal fiefdom of Ferdinand Piech, who was in charge as chief executive and chairman for more than 20 years until April. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive until Wednesday, was his ally and did little to prevent this. If Winterkorn and Piech were to meet their goal of VW becoming the world’s biggest carmaker, they needed to crack the US. In order to crack the US, VW needed to persuade American drivers to buy its diesel cars, which the German company had promoted as its unique, environmentally friendly selling point. Thus, VW was under pressure to increase sales in the US. It now appears that this pressure, mixed with a dysfunctional corporate culture, was a toxic mix. The company will have to show the world it has changed and made a fresh start to recover from this scandal. That process will start with the construction of a new management team and corporate structure. It should survive, even if it has to pay a potential $18bn in US fines, plus other penalties in Europe and consumer claims. But past corporate scandals show there are years of hard rebuilding work ahead. After Toyota’s own recall crisis in 2010, its share price did not bottom out for another two years – and the Japanese manufacturer was not deliberately rigging its cars. VW has to recover from damaged customer perceptions, a sharp rise in the cost of financing its bonds, a possible big hit to sales, a probable loss of its valuable pricing power, and its share price falling by a third. It may turn out that the lasting legacy of this crisis is not the damage done to VW, but the hit to diesel cars and the combustion engine. Amid the chaos of the last week, it was little noticed that shares at Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, rose more than 5%. Sales of diesel cars have grown sharply in Europe as governments have backed them with tax breaks. Half of new car sales in the UK are now diesel. In the US, support has not been as forthcoming and diesel has just 3% of the market. Any support for diesel cars is now going to be put into reverse, and sales will fall with it. If it subsequently emerges that tests on petrol engines and fuel mileage figures have also been fixed, then all bets – apart from those on Tesla’s share price – are off. What price avoiding humiliation at Hinkley? Why did chancellor George Osborne have to scuttle off to China last week to round up funding for Hinkley Point, the expensive nuclear power station he wants to build in Somerset? The short answer is that every sensible investor decided long ago to give this troubled project a wide berth. Centrica, owner of British Gas, was the most high-profile refusenik. In 2013, it decided it could no longer throw good money after bad and took a £200m write-off rather than commit to a 20% stake. Former chief executive Sam Laidlaw’s investment record at Centrica was patchy but his judgment on that occasion was impeccable. “Since our initial investment, the anticipated project costs in new nuclear have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years,” he said. Since then, Hinkley’s costs have ballooned to £24bn and the timetable been stretched ever further. The last government’s response was to agree a absurdly generous “strike” price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley’s output. Yet still it’s a struggle to get the investors to sign up. The European pressurised reactors (EPRs) that EDF, lead backer of Hinkley, is building in Finland and on home turf in Normandy are massively over budget and years behind schedule. “For third parties observing the announcements of delays and cost overruns for the EPRs under construction, it is difficult to commit,” Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF, told French newspaper Les Echos last week. Don’t worry, continued Lévy, the Chinese “still have confidence in the EPR”. Up to a point. They, like everyone else, can see Osborne is desperate. They also require loan guarantees and a pledge that they can build their own nuclear plant (to a different design, naturally) in Essex. In short, the Chinese have Osborne over a barrel. One wonders what other incentives have been offered to avoid a humiliating U-turn on Hinkley. The final deal, assuming it is agreed, should be published in full: and parliament should comb every line. Women retailers left on the shelf In respected retailer John Timpson’s new book High Street Heroes – The Story of British Retail in 50 People – only one woman earns her own chapter: Anita Roddick. Roddick built the Body Shop into an international business, demonstrating ethics and financial success could be combined. She challenged the status quo – but so did Mary Perkins, who built the Specsavers empire, and Jacqueline Gold, who runs Ann Summers. They are bundled together in one chapter. And Timpson has completely missed some other groundbreaking retailers, such as Natalie Massenet of online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter, or Jane Shepherdson, who did so much to build the Topshop brand and revive Whistles. But perhaps Timpson can be excused. While the vast majority of money spent on the high street comes out of women’s purses and is handed over to women at the tills, nearly all the UK’s major retailers are controlled by men. The high street faces enormous challenges and needs fresh perspective more than ever. Women need a bigger part in the next chapter of retail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/may/26/global-trade-france-autos-fertility-dilemma","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-26T14:43:11Z","webTitle":"Inside the 29 May edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/may/26/global-trade-france-autos-fertility-dilemma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/may/26/global-trade-france-autos-fertility-dilemma","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 29 May edition","bodyText":"A picture is worth a thousand words.

In Ireland, a referendum returned resounding support for same-sex marriage. In Syria, the ancient city of Palmyra was taken by Islamic State, sparking fears for its magnificent antiquities. And in China, a leading scientist warned over the country’s dash for nuclear power. Our front-page piece asks if globalisation has hit the wall. World trade once felt like a universal goal. Have national fears and volatile markets pushed it from the world agenda? Observer economics editor Heather Stewart considers the matter. There was much by way of words to keep us busy. Shifting from news to views, columnist Gary Younge opens our Comment section by arguing that America continues to avoid truths about the war in Iraq. The troops may have left, but the fallout from the conflict lingers. On the UK front, Jonathan Freedland, executive editor of the Guardian’s opinion section, says that Britain’s Labour party must make peace with its past, and with three-time election winner Tony Blair, before it can pick up the pieces and move on. I’d also like to highlight a wonderful nugget on these pages. Our In praise of… column remembers the beautiful mind of American mathematician John Nash, who was killed in a car crash last weekend.

Kernkraftwerk Krümmel, on the banks of the Elbe in the small town of Geesthacht, northern Germany, is one of eight nuclear power plants shut permanently in the country following the Fukushima meltdown. A further nine, built relatively recently which have unblemished safety records, will be shut by 2022 as part of Germany's energiewende march from nuclear to renewables. A year later, if all goes to plan, Britain will switch on Hinkley Point C – two reactors built at a cost of £16bn by France's state-owned EDF with funding from China. \"The Brits are crazy,\" Claudia Roth, incoming deputy speaker of the German Bundestag and former head of the Green party, said in an interview with the Guardian. \"How can one build new nuclear plants when all the world understood, or should have understood, that Fukushima was not an exception but a part of the industry. \"It is completely irresponsible. Fukushima proved that Chernobyl [nuclear meltdown in 1986] was not an exception unique to old Soviet plants but a fact of the industry,\" said Roth, who displays her green credentials by wearing a hat and a scarf to keep down the heating in her Bundestag office. \"If Japan cannot even guarantee safety, it is totally irresponsible to build new plants. I don't understand why Britain is doing this. You are an island, you have wind, you have sun, you have water, you have everything … Why the hell are they doing this? The government is really crazy.\" The nuclear industry, which supplied more than a quarter of Germany's power before the 2011 shutdown, says the German government is crazy to be closing nuclear plants that cost billions of euros to build and have years of life left in them. Closing the country's entire nuclear fleet was first proposed in 2000 and due to take 20 years, but politicians had wrangled over that timetable. That was until Fukushima, when the government abruptly ordered shutdowns to start immediately and be completed within 10 years. Nicolas Wendler of the German Nuclear Forum, the industry trade body, said the decision was \"illogical\" and \"emotional rather than practical\". \"We are totally convinced that our nuclear plants are operated safely,\" he said. \"European Union stress tests show that German plants are among the safest in the EU. The arguments for the closure are not based on safety, it is political.\" Wendler said the shutdown was costing taxpayers billions. A green levy on energy bills has risen fivefold since 2009 to 6.24 cents a kilowatt-hour from next year – adding €34 a year to the average German household bill. German energy bills are already the third highest in the EU (UK bills are the 13th highest out of the 27 member states). The tax will bring in €23.6bn (£20bn) of funding for the German government's aim of producing 80% of electricity from renewables by 2050. Currently 23% of German electricity is from renewable sources, compared with 4% in the UK. The European Renewable Energy Council said the UK's slow progress means it is likely to miss its target of producing 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Wendler says the German nuclear industry is \"resolved\" to a nuclear power free Germany as the political consensus against nuclear will make it impossible to overturn the ban. However, analysts expect that the Green party's decision to rule itself out of the future coalition could allow chancellor Angela Merkel some wiggle room in scaling back the speed of the shutdown, expected to cost €550m. Merkel has already named tackling the soaring cost of energy as one of four \"big tasks\" facing the forthcoming grand coalition. The others are the eurozone crisis, Germany's ageing population and federal reforms. The owners of Germany's nuclear plants – E.ON, RWE and Sweden's Vattenfall – are suing the government for about €16bn for the enforced closures, which the industry claims were unconstitutional. The legal battles, winding their way through the German courts and the World Bank's international centre for settlement of investment disputes in Washington, are not expected to be resolved until 2015. Roth said higher bills and the threat of compensation payouts were the \"price we have to pay if you want to stop these terrible dangerous things\". But many of those living in the shadow of Krümmel power station say they would rather live with the nuclear risk than soaring bills. Levent Rexin, 36, who has lived near the power plant all his life, said: \"Our government wants us to be nuclear-free, but the industry doesn't pay for it, the government doesn't pay for it, we have to pay for it. Bills go up and up and they will go up more.\" The nuclear debate has centred on Krümmel because the plant, owned by Vattenfall and E.ON in a 50:50 joint venture, fell victim to a series of accidents that led to it being dubbed the \"Krümmel monster\". Built near the factory where Alfred Nobel discovered dynamite, the plant caught fire in 2007 when a transformer short-circuited. The fire did not reach the reactor, but the plant was shut immediately while the company and officials investigated. More than €700m was spent repairing the damage and investing in new technology at Krümmel and a similar Vattenfall plant nearby. The Krümmel reactor was switched back on in 2009 but within days another transformer short-circuited. Further millions were invested tightening safety and the plant was preparing to go live in March 2011, when the tsunami struck Japan and caused the Fukushima meltdown. Sandra, a chemical assistant at Krümmel, said: \"Nuclear is dangerous, but there are dangers in everything and Germany is known for having the strictest controls. Germany is stupid to close these plants after investing so much money. All the countries around us aren't closing their plants and the UK and Turkey are building new ones. \"If something happens the fallout and the horror will not stop at the border.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/apr/23/edf-energy-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-23T13:04:32Z","webTitle":"EDF Energy to cut jobs to control cost of building nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/23/edf-energy-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/apr/23/edf-energy-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"EDF Energy to cut jobs to control cost of building nuclear power station","bodyText":"EDF energy is cutting scores of jobs to control costs at the site of its proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The company is in the middle of difficult negotiations with ministers over the level of public subsidy the new reactors will receive over the next 40 years but insisted the project is not being mothballed and that it is not \"holding a gun to the government's head\". The company has already spent £800m on developing the £14bn project and lost its junior partner when Centrica pulled out in February. \"As part of good project management, and to control costs, EDF Energy has taken steps to refocus its activities at its Hinkley Point C project,\" said a spokeswoman. \"This reflects its priorities ahead of securing the financing necessary for the project.\" EDF refused to give the number of workers losing their jobs, citing ongoing consultations with staff and unions, but the Guardian understands it will be about 150 of the current 800-strong workforce. The company said further pre-construction planning work would continue but that preparation of the site had halted. EDF wants to build two new reactors at Hinkley. It says they would provide reliable and low-carbon electricity making up 7% of the UK's demand and provide 25,000 job opportunities during construction, with 900 long-term posts. The UK government has placed new nuclear reactors at the heart of its energy policy, to replace the ageing fleet of nuclear and coal plants which are being phased out. But the two sides have been unable to agree on the subsidy the plant would receive, paid for by consumers through their energy bills. EDF had originally said it would make its final investment decision by the end of 2012. Both sides have a great deal to lose, but as the negotiations have dragged on observers have suggested the likelihood of the government abandoning plans for a series of new nuclear plants. \"It is proving extremely difficult to get that first nuclear power plant built and there is an increasing feeling in industry that at £14bn a throw there is no chance of getting beyond one,\" said Lord Robin Teverson, the LibDem spokesman on energy in the House of Lords. A spokesman for the department of energy and climate change said: \"Progress is being made in our discussions with EDF. Both sides have an interest in reaching a positive agreement.\" EDF and the government face a number of major obstacles in delivering new reactors even beyond the challenging financing. The project has yet to be approved by the European Union, which limits the state aid that can be given to industrial projects. The UK also has no site for the long term disposal of nuclear waste, after the rejection of a proposal in Cumbria by local councils. Such a facility was considered a prerequisite for the building of new reactors by David Cameron before the 2010 election. The EDF spokeswoman said: \"The case for new nuclear in the UK remains as strong as ever.\" She said Ed Davey, the energy secretary had granted planning permission for Hinkley and that the reactor design has been approved by regulators. But a senior EDF executive said recently: \"We cannot afford to burn money every day, every week, every month without a clear understanding of where it's leading us.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/mar/26/new-discovery-uses-virus-to-boil-water-three-times-faster","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-26T18:18:23Z","webTitle":"Discovery uses virus to boil water three times faster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/26/new-discovery-uses-virus-to-boil-water-three-times-faster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/mar/26/new-discovery-uses-virus-to-boil-water-three-times-faster","fields":{"headline":"Discovery uses virus to boil water three times faster","bodyText":"Scientists have found a way to boil water faster, although they admit the discovery is unlikely to revolutionise tea-making. The technology works by coating a heating element with a virus found on tobacco plants. The coating dramatically reduces the size and number of bubbles that form around the element as it gets warmer. Air pockets caused by bubbles temporarily insulate heating elements from the surrounding water, slowing down the transfer of heat. A coating made from the tobacco virus tripled the efficiency of boiling water, scientists said, which could save vast quantities of energy in industrial power plants or large-scale electronic cooling systems. “Even slight improvements to technologies that are used so widely can be quite impactful,” said Matthew McCarthy, an engineer at Drexel University in Pennsylvania. Controlling the formation of bubbles would also help guard against a scenario called “critical heat flux” that is undesirable – sometimes disastrous – in industrial boilers. This happens when so many bubbles are forming that they merge into a blanket surrounding the element, meaning that it can no longer transfer heat to the water. “What happens then is the dry surface gets hotter and hotter, like a pan on the stove without water in it,” said McCarthy. “This failure can lead to the simple destruction of electronic components, or in power plant cooling applications, the catastrophic meltdown of a nuclear reactor.” To counteract this effect, scientists have been attempting to develop surfaces that repel bubbles and keep the boiling surface wet. McCarthy’s team has identified tobacco mosaic virus, which is roughly pencil-shaped, as the perfect structure for wicking moisture downwards towards a surface. The team has developed a genetically modified strain of the virus, with “molecular hooks” allowing it to adhere to nearly any surface. The researchers grow tobacco plants in the lab and infect them with the modified tobacco mosaic virus. “When the plants are really sick, we put them in the blender and you get a sort of green soup,” said McCarthy. After several rounds of centrifuging and chemical separation, which takes two days, the scientists are left with a perfectly clear solution of concentrated virus. When poured over a surface, the virus self-assembles into a layer of nano-tendrils, each pointing upward like a blade of grass. The surface is then covered with a microscopically thin layer of nickel, rendering the virus inert. The remaining “metallic grass” wicks liquids across the surface, allowing the water and element to remain in contact. In tests, the coating has been shown to more than triple the heat transfer rate, depending on the surface to which it is applied. The “metallic grass” coating resulted in the boiling process occurring three times more efficiently. So if two pots of water – one with the tobacco coating, one without – were heated to the same temperature, the coated pot would produce twice as much water vapour. In a system designed to cool down a silicon electronic part, the coating almost tripled the temperature that the silicon could reach before critical heat flux occurred. “In the future this could be used in nuclear power stations, really kick-ass computers or for the liquid cooling of high-powered electronic devices like radar systems,” said McCarthy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2015/apr/14/european-commission-antitrust-charges-google","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-15T11:27:58Z","webTitle":"European commission announces antitrust charges against Google","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/14/european-commission-antitrust-charges-google","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2015/apr/14/european-commission-antitrust-charges-google","fields":{"headline":"European commission announces antitrust charges against Google","bodyText":"The European Union accused Google on Wednesday of cheating competitors by distorting Internet search results in favour of its Google Shopping service and also launched an antitrust probe into its Android mobile operating system. In a statement, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the US tech giant, which dominates Internet search engines globally, had been sent a Statement of Objections - effectively a charge sheet - to which it can respond. “I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust rules,” she said. “If the investigation confirmed our concerns, Google would have to face the legal consequences and change the way it does business in Europe.” Both Vestager and her predecessor, Joaquín Almunia, have been under pressure from European and US tech concerns to investigate Google’s activities on the continent, where competitors – including Microsoft – say Google has abused its 90% market share by using its products, particularly search, to illegally promote its other products and services. Google-made products like Google+ and the company’s e-commerce sites are placed higher in search, detractors say, whether or not they are the superior option, and users are not aware they’re seeing what amounts to advertising. At issue are multiple charges, among them the problem of interoperability – the capacity of programs and web pages created by competing companies to play nicely together, which can be undermined and subverted in ways that aren’t immediately obvious to the user. The antitrust agreement Almunia was brokering with the company last year was roundly criticized by other companies in the market. Mathias Döpfner, CEO of German media company Axel Springer SE, wrote an open letter to Google chief executive Eric Schmidt a year ago in Frankfurter Allgemeine. “The statement ‘If you don’t like Google, you can remove yourself from their listings and go elsewhere,’” he wrote, “is about as realistic as recommending to an opponent of nuclear power that he just stop using electricity.” Prasad Krishnamurthy, assistant professor of law at Berkeley Law, said the EC’s powers in this case are substantial and the punishments it could levy potentially catastrophic for Google. “One power they have that makes them different from the [US] Federal Trade Commission or even the Department of Justice is that they can collect fines to the tune of tens of millions of dollars,” he said. Indeed, the Brussels-based authority fined computer chip-maker Intel €1.06bn in 2009 and upheld the fine on appeal last year. There is a long history of international tech corporations encouraging the EC to punish competitors going back to (among others) Microsoft itself, after a complaint by Sun Microsystems, which accused Microsoft of abusing its majority share in a way not dissimilar from the charges expected to be filed against Google. Microsoft ended up paying €497m. But, Krishnamurthy said, a fine is not the worst thing the EC can do, as far as Google is concerned. “The other power that the EC has is that they can put into place equitable remedies, conduct remedies, that would substantially hamper Google’s business practices. In some sense, they might be more worried about that than otherwise – to the extent that this messes with the search businesses, which offers advertisers revenue, it will affect their business model substantially.” Google can talk to the European commission and bargain, of course, but they might want more than a fine and a promise not to do it again. “If they think that Google’s practices are anticompetitive and they feel strongly about a conduct remedy that goes to the heart of Google’s advertising model, [Google] won’t be able to settle and they’ll have to litigate.” Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-13T17:27:14Z","webTitle":"Doubts over ice wall to keep Fukushima safe from damaged nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Doubts over ice wall to keep Fukushima safe from damaged nuclear reactors","bodyText":"In fading light and just a stone's throw from the most terrifying scenes during Japan's worst nuclear accident, engineers resumed their race against time to defeat the next big threat: thousands of tonnes of irradiated water. If all goes to plan, by next March Fukushima Daiichi's four damaged reactors will be surrounded by an underground frozen wall that will be a barrier between highly toxic water used to cool melted fuel inside reactor basements and clean groundwater flowing in from surrounding hills. Up to 400 tonnes of groundwater that flows into the basements each day must be pumped out, stored and treated – and on-site storage is edging closer to capacity. Decommissioning the plant will be impossible until its operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] addresses the water crisis. Last month workers from Tepco and the construction firm Kajima Corp began inserting 1,550 pipes 33 metres vertically into the ground to form a rectangular cordon around the reactors. Coolant set at -30C will be fed into the pipes, eventually freezing the surrounding earth to create an impermeable barrier. \"We started work a month ago and have installed more than 100 pipes, so it is all going according to plan to meet our deadline,\" Tadafumi Asamura, a Kajima manager who is supervising the ice wall construction, said as workers braved rain, humidity and radiation to bore holes in the ground outside reactor No 4, scene of one of three hydrogen explosions at the plant in the early days of the crisis. But sealing off the four reactors – three of which melted down in the March 2011 disaster – is costly and not without risks. The 32bn-yen (£185m) wall will be built with technology that has never been used on such a large scale. \"I'm not convinced the freeze wall is the best option,\" Dale Klein, former head of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a senior adviser to Tepco, recently told Kyodo News. \"What I'm concerned about is unintended consequences. Where does that water go and what are the consequences of that? I think they need more testing and more analysis.\" The 1,500-metre wall will stay in use until 2020, using enough electricity every year to power 13,000 households, according to officials. Over the next eight months, 360 workers from Tepco and Kajima will work in rotating shifts of up to four hours a day, with each shift beginning in the early evening to combat heat exhaustion. Each worker is wrapped in hazardous materials suits and full-face masks, along with tungsten-lined rubber torso bibs for added protection against radiation. Tepco's record of mishaps in the three years since Fukushima Daiichi suffered a triple meltdown suggests the wall project will not be trouble free. The firm has had problems freezing irradiated water – using the same method being used to build the underground wall – that has accumulated in underground trenches, raising concerns that the ice technology is flawed. \"There have been challenges over the past three years, but major improvements too,\" Fukushima Daiichi's manager, Akira Ono, told the Guardian and other visiting journalists this week. \"We know it's not 100% yet and we're working to make it better. What is important is that we recognise the problems and take action to solve them.\" Ono said Tepco had safely removed 1,200 of the 1,500 nuclear fuel assemblies that were being stored in a pool in reactor No 4 when the tsunami smashed into the plant, knocking out back-up power supplies and sending three of its reactors into meltdown. The rest would be removed, on schedule, by the end of the year, he added. But attempts to address the build-up of contaminated water in reactor basements suffered a serious setback last year when storage tanks sprung leaks. The plant's water-treatment facility, which can remove all radioactive nuclides except tritium, has been suspended several times owing to malfunctions. All three lines of the system are running again, but only on a trial basis, according to Tepco spokesman Yuichi Nagano. \"We hope to have treated all the contaminated water stored on site by next March,\" he said. Ono said the wall would work in tandem with a recently completed bypass that reroutes clean groundwater directly into the Pacific, and underground wells. Last month, Japan's nuclear regulators voiced concern at the failure to freeze the water in the trenches. Ono conceded attempts had been unsuccessful, but said it did not mean the ice-wall technology was faulty. \"The water inside the trenches isn't freezing properly because it is circulating inside at higher speeds [than the groundwater],\" he said. \"I'm confident we'll be able to freeze the trench water by next March.\" As it enters a critical phase of the Fukushima Daiichi clean-up, Tepco is contending with low morale among employees, about 3,000 of whom have quit or taken early retirement since the March 2011 disaster. Many have turned their back on nuclear power to take better-paid, less stressful jobs in other parts of the energy industry. Ono recognised the difficulties facing workers, but dismissed suggestions that there would not be enough people to decommission the plant. \"In a sense decommissioning a nuclear power plant is a backward-looking operation, but we face so many unprecedented challenges that I think of it as forward-looking,\" he said, citing the deployment of newly designed robots to locate and remove melted nuclear fuel. \"That's the kind of thing that motivates our engineers to keep going.\" He insisted that the 6,000 men from Tepco and its huge network of contractors and subcontractors now working at Fukushima Daiichi would see the world's most complex nuclear cleanup through to the end. \"Obviously, it's difficult to say for sure how many years it's going to take … at the moment we're talking about 30 or 40 years,\" he said. \"But I know that our employees have a strong sense of mission – the Tepco spirit, if you like – that is being passed down from one generation of workers to the next.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/dec/01/finland-green-light-joint-nuclear-venture-russian-energy-rosatom","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-01T16:47:23Z","webTitle":"Finland set to agree joint nuclear venture with Russian energy company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/finland-green-light-joint-nuclear-venture-russian-energy-rosatom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/01/finland-green-light-joint-nuclear-venture-russian-energy-rosatom","fields":{"headline":"Finland set to agree joint nuclear venture with Russian energy company","bodyText":"Finland’s parliament is poised to give the go-ahead to a controversial joint venture with the Russian state-owned energy company Rosatom to build a new nuclear power plant in the north of the country. The green light will come despite calls by the EU for member states to suspend most planned energy agreements with Russia, as part of an international campaign of economic and financial sanctions prompted by the Ukraine crisis. The nuclear joint venture is understood to have the support of a majority of MPs from the four main Finnish political parties and to be backed by the coalition government led by the prime minister, Alexander Stubb. A vote will take place on Wednesday. The leader of Finland’s Green party, Ville Niinisto, quit the coalition in September in protest, citing concerns about Rosatom’s close links to the regime of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. “The Greens cannot accept it,” Niinisto said after the government gave its approval in principle. He claimed the decision smacked of subservience to Moscow. The deal has also resurrected fears about nuclear safety and Finland’s energy security. The country relies on Russia for 100% of its gas imports, 71% of its oil, 66% of its coal, 48% of its nuclear fuel, and 28% of its electricity. Overall, Finland imports 64% of its energy requirements, two-thirds of that from Russia, and has an energy import-export imbalance costing €7bn (£5.6bn) a year. Previous Russian moves to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine and eastern Europe have fuelled worries that Finland could come under similar pressure if, for example, it decided to join Nato. Stubb has rejected suggestions that by backing Rosatom’s involvement he was bowing to Moscow, while Rosatom has given assurances the project will not be used for political ends. Finland must be both “principled and pragmatic” in dealing with its giant neighbour, Stubb said in an interview. He had previously accused his critics of “Russophobia”. “I hope that Rosatom’s participation won’t threaten the existence of this project which is a very long-term endeavour. We hope the Ukraine crisis will be resolved in the nearer term,” he said in September. Fennovoima, the Finnish consortium of 40 companies that will partner Rosatom in building the new 1,200 megawatt nuclear plant at Pyhäjoki, first gained permission in 2010 but delays followed. A protest last month outside the construction site in Pyhäjoki was broken up by police, with six activists arrested. Jukka Leskelä, director of power generation at Finnish Energy Industries, which represents distribution companies, said: “We expect to have parliamentary ratification in December of the government’s positive decision in principle.” Rosatom, which will supply the reactor, currently holds a 34% stake in the project. The government in Helsinki has stipulated that Finnish ownership must be at least 60% by next summer, up from the current 52%, for the project to go ahead. Its total cost is estimated at €4bn-€6bn. Fennovoima turned to Rosatom after a legal dispute arose between the French-German consortium, Areva-Siemens, and its Finnish partner, TVO, over the escalating cost of construction of another new nuclear reactor, known as Olkiluoto 3. But industry analysts said Rosatom was not the only alternative open to Fennovoima, pointing out that Japan’s Toshiba had expressed interest in taking on the project. Leskelä said Finland could quickly switch to other energy suppliers if Russia proved an unreliable or problematic partner, but he admitted the cost would be high for Finland’s struggling economy. “We have a good relationship with Russia. It’s always political, of course. But there have never been any stoppages. One of the reasons is that we always pay on time,” he said. “Russia has no reason to change this, we hope! Energy security is very important, and so is maintaining energy alternatives. If Finland joined Nato, for example, Russia has said its attitude would change.” Nuclear power is controversial in Finland, although attitudes have shifted in recent decades in response to rising concern about global warming and climate change. In a recent Gallup poll 41% of respondents said they had a “positive” attitude, compared with 24% who were “negative”. Renewables, mostly wood-based bio-energy, now account for 36% of all energy end-use, while the use of oil for heating has plunged from 60% in 1976 to under 5% in 2012. Coal use has also fallen sharply. Widespread use of highly adaptable district heat systems, piping directly to consumers from enclosed incinerators burning general household waste, such as that operated by Vantaan Energia near Helsinki, have brought big cost savings and reduced CO2 emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/feb/26/greenpeace-head-kumi-naidoo-saddened-at-spying-revelations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-26T14:43:38Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo saddened at spying revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/greenpeace-head-kumi-naidoo-saddened-at-spying-revelations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/feb/26/greenpeace-head-kumi-naidoo-saddened-at-spying-revelations","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo saddened at spying revelations","bodyText":"A veteran of South Africa’s anti-apartheid struggle has expressed “sadness, hurt and deep disappointment” that the country’s democratic government may have been spying on him. Kumi Naidoo, now the international head of Greenpeace, said he had gained legal representation and wanted an urgent meeting with the minister responsible for intelligence after leaked cables revealed that he was targeted as a potential security threat ahead of a major global summit. The human rights campaigner questioned why South Africa, one of the world’s most unequal societies, would waste money on spies to monitor his activities when it could find the information for free on his Facebook or Twitter accounts or the Greenpeace website. Naidoo, who grew up in poverty during white minority rule, became an activist when he was 15. He was arrested several times, put on trial and, facing a possible 15-year jail term, fled into exile in Britain. His contribution has been recognised by a national photography and film project called 21 Icons that also includes Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. In 2009 he became the first African to lead Greenpeace, one of the world’s best known environmental groups. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service asked South Africa for a “specific security assessment” of Naidoo ahead of a meeting of G20 leaders in Seoul in 2010. The request linked him with two other South Africans who had been swept up in an anti-terrorist raid in Pakistan but later released and returned to South Africa. It is not clear whether South African intelligence complied with the request. The details emerged this week from hundreds of dossiers, files and cables obtained by al-Jazeera and shared with the Guardian in what has been described as the worst security breach in South Africa’s post-apartheid history. “My main reaction when I was contacted by al-Jazeera was not one of surprise or frustration or anger,” Naidoo said on Thursday. “It was one of sadness, hurt and deep disappointment. “It’s not as if it’s a shock, I’ll be honest. After the Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks revelations, you’d have to be rather naive to say: ‘Oh, I was shocked.’ We make assumptions that it’s happening, but to have it confirmed has a chilling and numbing effect. What’s important to note is that this can send a very negative message about democratic participation in society.” The 50-year-old has visited South Korea several times and believes its intelligence service made the request because of his outspoken opposition to nuclear power. “In 2010 when the G20 meeting was taking place in South Korea, one of the things that the South Korean government had on its agenda was to use that opportunity to push its nuclear technology, particularly in the direction of countries like South Africa, Turkey and India. “But what hurts more is an impression that I now have that my government might have – I’m going to be generous and say ‘might have’ – been engaged in surveillance activity against me, as well as might have shared that with South Korean intelligence upon request.” Some cables published this week show South Africa receiving requests only to deny them, Naidoo added, citing the example of Cameroon asking for information on the country’s opposition leader, Pierre Mila Assouté. But he noted: “What I don’t see in the cables that are available is in fact a denial from the South African government to the South Koreans, saying: ‘This is a citizen of ours who was part of the liberation struggle who had been supporting democracy and human rights since the age of 15 and we do not believe there’s any reason for you to [make this request] “They shouldn’t even have to tell them any of what I’ve just said. They should have just done what they did for the Cameroonian opposition party and said there’s no way, and I’m hoping that’s the case, but right now from the way it reads, it doesn’t seem to be the case.” Naidoo, a former Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, said he would now seek official answers with representation from the Legal Resources Centre, an organisation renowned for its work during the struggle and more recent crises such as the Marikana mine massacre.Its senior counsel, George Bizos, was Nelson Mandela’s lawyer and close friend for half a century. Naidoo has also written to the state security minister, David Mahlobo, to request a meeting as soon as possible. “Essentially what I would like to hear from my government is that one, we did not collaborate with the South Korean intelligence and share that information, and secondly I would like to have a confirmation that I’m not a subject of surveillance and monitoring.” He continued: “It’s important that we recognise that in a country where so many of our people do not have access to proper housing, proper electricity, proper sanitation – and let me just say, saying ‘proper sanitation’ is a bit of jargon for a decent place to shit and piss, and that’s a basic human right that many of our people don’t have – I see resources being wasted on surveillance and other activities, most of which information is easily available on Twitter, Facebook and the Greenpeace website. “I’m very transparent about all the places, what I’m doing, the activities and so on: it’s a much cheaper way to actually collect any information rather than having people’s privacy being invaded.” Naidoo, the international executive director of Greenpeace, also plans to write an open letter to the South African president, Jacob Zuma, outlining his concerns and how they relate to the broader energy crisis facing South Africa, which plans to invest heavily in nuclear power stations. “Put simply, nuclear is too expensive, too dangerous and as a so-called solution to our electricity crisis and as solution to climate change, will deliver too little too late.” Concluding a press conference at Johannesburg’s Constitution Hill, which once held political prisoners including Gandhi and Mandela but is now home to the country’s highest court, he admitted: “It has been quite emotionally challenging for me. To be honest I was completely comfortable to be monitored and surveilled by the apartheid state. “In fact in those days if they weren’t surveilling you at all it was like a little bit of a bad thing. It was like, ‘What? They didn’t come and arrest you, they’re not monitoring you? Oh comrade, you’re not so militant!’ “So I have no problem with that during that period, but I do feel deeply hurt if resources are being used [for it now]. I want to believe that I will get the confirmation from my government saying that it’s not been the case and they did not share information on me with any external, whether it’s South Korean or other agencies.” Under growing pressure, the South African government issued a response to the leaks on Wednesday, saying a full investigation had been launched. “The leaking of the purported documents detailing operational details of the State Security Agency is condemned in the strongest possible terms,” Mahlobo said. “It is illegal to disclose such information outside of the classification protocols in place. Such conduct has the dangerous effect of undermining operational effectiveness of the work to secure this country and borders on undermining diplomatic relations with our partners in the international community. Any leakages of classified information undermine the national security of any state.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/dec/21/nuclear-power-necessary-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-21T13:08:18Z","webTitle":"Is nuclear power necessary for solving climate change?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/21/nuclear-power-necessary-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/dec/21/nuclear-power-necessary-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Is nuclear power necessary for solving climate change?","bodyText":"The relative costs and benefits of nuclear energy have been the subject of heated debate in recent years thanks to a combination of factors, including the need to cut carbon emissions and the 2011 accident at Fukushima, Japan. Critics argue that nuclear is not only dangerous but also unnecessary for tackling climate change; supporters claim the risks are small and that abandoning nuclear would make an already huge challenge even harder and more expensive. One thing that's clear is that decarbonising electric power will be critical for solving climate change. Even assuming big gains in efficiency, the world will need about twice as much electricity in 2050 as it does today. The problem is that, as of today, most of the world's electricity comes from coal (40%) and gas (20%), with hydroelectric (16%) and nuclear (13%) by far the largest low-carbon sources. In Europe most of the new generating capacity being added today is low-carbon wind. In China, the world's largest energy consumer, most of the new capacity is coal, although it is also the world's largest investor in both wind and nuclear. Worldwide, the majority of new capacity is still coal or gas. This situation needs to be turned around radically and urgently if we are to meet the objective that world leaders set in Copenhagen in 2009 of limiting the average increase in global temperatures to 2C. By then, the great majority of the world's energy will need to come from low-carbon sources. In developed countries, such as the UK, virtually all of it. 2050 may seem a long way away until you remember that a new coal or nuclear power station being planned today will probably still be operating then. The main low-carbon options for the coming years and decades, in no particular order, are hydro, wind, nuclear, biofuels, solar power and coal and gas burned in plants that can capture and store the carbon emissions (CCS). The availability of hydro, wind and solar depends, to varying degrees, on local conditions. Wind and solar are intermittent and cannot provide 'baseload' power (a drawback that can be mitigated to some degree, at a cost, by large connecting power networks or large-scale energy storage). Biofuels depend on the availability of plant materials. For these reasons a mixture of sources will be needed and the optimum choices will be different in different parts of the world. CCS is the only low-carbon option other than nuclear that can provide baseload power in regions where hydro or large-scale biofuel materials are not available. To that extent, particularly in the UK, where we know that we have suitable natural storage reservoirs, CCS provides a possible alternative to nuclear if it can be successfully demonstrated. There is a lot of uncertainty about the cost of nuclear power compared to the alternatives. A recent UK study estimated the cost of nuclear as falling somewhere above 'low cost' options such as onshore wind, mini-hydro and some biofuels, but below 'expensive' options such as offshore wind and CCS. Early stage technologies such as wave are estimated as having still higher costs. The report suggests that the uncertainties are considerable and that these increase as one looks towards the future. Comparatively, solar power is expensive today but its cost has been declining sharply and it could emerge as a highly competitive option, especially in sunny parts of the world. CCS is a technical possibility but it is hard to know what it will cost until it has been demonstrated. Following the Fukushima accident, most of the developing countries with plans for new nuclear stations, and many of the developed countries, are expected to press ahead, though with some delay for safety reviews. However, Germany, where 23% of electricity was nuclear, has decided to phase out nuclear power entirely by 2020 while also seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels. The jury is still out on how successful this will be. Germany can be expected to pioneer the way towards much heavier reliance on renewables but some analysts are concerned about the cost and the possible need for additional gas or even coal plants. Not surprisingly, energy modellers do not all agree on which low-carbon energy technologies will be needed most in 2050. Amongst the better known commentators, the International Energy Agency project a nuclear share of 20%, while the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis similarly predict a significant share for nuclear in two of their three headline scenarios, but also offer a scenario in which nuclear has been phased out. All in all, there is no simple answer to this question. If you believe strongly enough that we should phase out nuclear then with sufficiently strong political commitment around the world, this could be done consistently with tackling climate change. However, as a practical matter, we are far from being on course to limit carbon emissions to levels consistent with a 2C target. Ruling out one of the major low-carbon technology options currently available is bound to add to the difficulty and the risk of what is already looking like a very tough challenge. Balancing the problems of nuclear power against its contribution to climate mitigation (and other energy policy objectives) is an inescapable dilemma. • This article was written by Neil Hirst of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London, in collaboration with the Guardian The ultimate climate change FAQ • This answer last updated: 27.09.2012 • Read about the project and suggest a question • Report an error in this answer Related questions • Are solar, wind and marine power too intermittent to be useful? • What's energy efficiency and how much can it help cut emissions? • Why do economists describe climate change as a 'market failure'?

Here’s Katie Allen’s updated news story: Back tomorrow. Cheers! GW In other news....a double-dose of bad economic news from America just hit the wires. Retail sales in the world’s largest economy shrank by 0.4% in August, twice as fast as in the UK during the same month. And US industrial production shrank 0.4 per cent last month – dashing expectations of a 0.2% rise. That’s the biggest monthly decline since March, and suggests America’s economy isn’t ready for an interest rate rise. Britain’s savers and pension fund holders may be irked by the prospect of another interest rate cut before Christmas. Charles Cowling, director at pensions consultants JLT Employee Benefits, says that ultra-loose monetary policy will have serious implications: “If markets are to be believed we could see interest rates stay at current record lows for the next 5 years, which is not good news for pension schemes. This means there is no respite in sight from the record pension deficits caused by the Bank’s interest rate policy. As a result, there are going to be inexorable demands on employers for significant increases to cash funding of pension schemes. This will not be good news for share prices or dividends.” Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, believes central banks are playing a dangerous game: “Last month’s monetary stimulus package, however, dragged down bond yields and added to the funding problems of pension funds. These long-term consequences of a prolonged period of low interest rates require more consideration from the Bank of England and other central banks. As we approach the 8th anniversary of the collapse of Lehmans, interest rates around the western world are still stuck close to zero. That is not a healthy situation for the long-term growth of economies - as we have seen in Japan.” Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, shows how stock markets have outperformed bank accounts since 1996: If anyone is unsure about the benefits of investing in the stock market over stashing cash under the mattress, our calculations show if you had invested £15,000 into the FTSE All Share index 20 years ago you would now be left with £55,105. If, however, you had invested £15,000 into the average UK savings account over the same period, you would be left with a paltry £20,100. That’s a difference of £35,005 – far too big for anyone to ignore. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects another rate cut in November: Here’s his take: “The Monetary Policy Committee had already cast doubt on the large fall in the July PMIs, so the economy’s bounce back in August should not have come as a surprise to them. There is enough evidence to suggest that while the economy may have slowed in Q3, it did not fall into recession, and the MPC note that data has actually been slightly stronger than they expected. “However, the Bank sees these short term concerns as a side issue, noting that there has been no new information since the August Inflation Report relevant for the UK economy’s longer-term prospects. “The Bank’s view is that the Brexit process will take some time, and will create uncertainties for households and firms. Specifically, they expect business spending to slow more sharply than consumer spending in response to this uncertainty. In my view, the news since the August Inflation Report should not have impacted this medium term assessment of the UK’s economic prospects, and I expect another rate cut in November.” The minutes of today’s meeting are online here. This was the last monthly meeting held by the MPC, which now moves to a new schedule of just eight meetings a year. The next scheduled announcement on interest rates is 3 November, when the Bank will also publish new forecasts for inflation and growth and Carney will hold a press conference. This is widely seen as the most likely time for another interest rate cut. The last scheduled MPC meeting for 2016 is on 15 December. Another factor that could sway Bank policymakers deciding on whether to cut interest rates even lower is chancellor Philip Hammond’s autumn statement due on 23 November when he will set out the new government’s tax and spending plans. Bank governor Mark Carney has repeatedly urged ministers they need to play a role in helping shore up the economy rather than leaving all the work to interest rate-setters at the Bank. Sterling is gloriously unrattled by the Bank of England’s announcement, and still hovering around the $1.322 mark. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes that the Bank of England could well cut interest rates again before Christmas. But he also believes it won’t do much good; instead, chancellor Phillip Hammond needs to boost government spending in November’s autumn statement. “UK interest rates already close to zero, further cuts will do little to stimulate growth and are likely to exacerbate the cost pressures that both businesses and consumers may face in the coming months from a weakening currency. “With the monetary policy tools at the MPC’s disposal largely exhausted, it is vital that the government uses the upcoming Autumn Statement to deliver a fiscal environment that supports confidence and incentivises businesses to invest.” Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says government spending, not central bank firepower, is the key to boosting UK growth. “In a world with zero bound growth, central banks will become increasingly judicious in choosing when, and how to act, and currently there is no pressing need for the MPC to show their hand again. Though trade data following Brexit reflects a positive narrative, there are still long-term considerations. The economy is still imbalanced, and investment has stumbled somewhat in light of uncertainty around the finer details of what a post-Brexit UK will look like. Businesses and investors are likely to exercise caution in the meantime, looking ahead to a potentially changing fiscal agenda, and the timing and nature of the article 50 trigger. A trigger as early as Q1 2017 would ease uncertainty, but any longer will make businesses think twice about commencing long-term capex plans.” Some snap reaction to the Bank’s announcement: The Bank of England also reckons that business spending will suffer a bigger hit from Brexit uncertainty than consumer spending (a theory borne out by this morning’s strong retail sales figures). It says: While most business investment intentions surveys weakened further since the August Inflation Report, the near-term outlook for the housing market is less negative than expected and the indicators of consumption have been a little stronger than expected. The Bank of England has dropped a clear hint that it could cut interest rates soon, perhaps as soon as November, unless the economy picks up. The minutes of today’s meeting say: “The committee’s view of the contours of the economic outlook following the EU referendum had not changed. News on the near-term momentum of the UK economy had, however, been slightly to the upside relative to the August inflation report projections. The committee will assess that news, along with other forthcoming indicators, during its November forecast round. If, in light of that full updated assessment, the outlook at that time is judged to be broadly consistent with the August inflation report projections, a majority of members expect to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC’s forthcoming meetings during the course of the year. The MPC currently judges this bound to be close to, but a little above, zero.” The Bank minutes noted inflation had come in weaker than anticipated back in August. They also noted that share prices had risen following last month’s interest rate cut and expansion to the electronic money-printing programme known as quantitative easing. “The package of measures announced by the committee at its August meeting led to a greater than anticipated boost to UK asset prices,” the minutes said. The Bank of England says it is less pessimistic about the UK economy. The minutes of today’s meeting state that “a number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected” since August’s rate cut. “The committee now expect less of a slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016. But policymakers said it was more difficult to use recent data to gauge the prospects for 2017 and beyond. “Moreover, there had been no new information since the August inflation report for longer-term prospects for the UK economy.” Ooooh, the two Bank of England policymakers who opposed expanding quantitative easing last month still think it was a bad idea. Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty argued that the extra £60bn of bond purchases was “unwarranted”, but reversing the decision would be too costly and disruptive. Here’s the news, hot off the Bank’s twitter feed: Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at 0.25%, an all-time low. It has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at £435bn. Both decisions were unanimous, with the MPC voting 9-0. More to follow! City traders are bracing for the Bank of England announcement at noon. Anthony Cheung of Amplify Trading says investors will be scrutinising the minutes of today’s meeting for signs of a split within the Monetary Policy Committee. With 20 minutes until the Bank of England’s decision on interest rates, let’s take a moment to remember that eight years ago all hell was breaking loose in the markets. Just after midnight US time on 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The news rocked Wall Street, triggering panic selling, and forcing policymakers to bail out a string of other financial firms to avoid complete meltdown. It was a genuinely scary time -- financial workers have been reminiscing about how they raced to withdraw cash as they feared the game was up. Eight years later, forecasts of a new great depression or massive market crashes have not come to pass. Instead, central banks have instead driven asset prices up, slashing borrowing costs and sending bond yields to record lows. Have policymakers saved the day, or simply deferred the day of reckoning? Ask us in in another eight years..... Here’s our news story about the UK retail sales figures: The recent run of strong economic data shows that confidence has bounced back after the immediate Brexit vote shock, says Sir John Gieve, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gieve says that the BoE would probably claim some credit, as might Theresa May (for rapidly forming a new government). Both things probably has an impact in stopping things escalating through the summer. But there’s no case for fresh action from the Bank of England today, Gieve adds. Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance is also on the show. He doesn’t believe Mark Carney should take credit for the economy’s resilience. It takes six to nine months for interest rate changes to feed through to the economy.... the Bank of England has moved prematurely [by cutting rates last month]. UK consumers are saying “so much for Brexit, the sun is shining!”, writes Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank. He reckons the UK economy may keep growing in the July-September quarter, despite the Brexit shock. But he also warns that retail sales growth may slow, especially if inflation and unemployment rise... The risk is that there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Good weather has been the main driver of spending growth in the last 2 months. But that might come unstuck in September - seasonal sales of warm clothing may suffer amid spectacular September weather. I’d rather have the warm weather than a warm coat, but I’m trying to sell government bonds, not coats and jumpers. The retail sales figures show that Britain’s economy is defying pessimistic predictions, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: The vote to leave the EU appears to have had little to no effect on consumers’ willingness to spend, and the underlying trend in UK retail sales remains one of robust growth. Surveys in the immediate aftermath of the referendum showed a sharp dip in consumer confidence, leading to predictions of weak sales over the coming months. However, the post-referendum landscape has been characterised by surveys forecasting a sharp weakening of activity, which have thus far failed to appear in the hard data. Today’s figures show that, so far at least, it appears to be business as usual for the UK consumer. Here’s some more detail about the 6.2% year-on-year jump in retail sales in August: all store types except textile, clothing and footwear, and household goods stores showed increases in the quantity bought and amount spent compared with August 2015 the quantity bought in household goods contracted year-on-year for the first time since May 2014 compared with August 2015 there were falls in average store prices across all store types, with the largest fall in petrol stations (2.5%); however, the fall of 1.9% in all retailing is the smallest fall we have seen since November 2014 Those strong August retail sales figures mean there’s even less reason for the Bank of England to slash interest rates again today. Boom! New retail sales figures show that British consumers haven’t been badly upset by the Brexit vote. Retail sales dipped by just 0.2% in August, the Office for National Statistics says, and were 6.2% higher than in August 2015. That beats City forecasts for a 0.4% monthly decline. And July’s already-impressive figures have been revised even higher, from 1.5% to 1.9% during the month. The ONS says: Regarding the EU referendum in late June, our data on retail sales since the vote show little evidence of a departure from recent trends. This chart shows how the City expects the Bank of England to cut interest rates again in the months ahead (but probably not today). John Lewis has reported that the Brexit referendum hasn’t caused it any grief yet. But the bellweather retailer is still finding life tough - profits have dropped by 15% in the last six months. And the company’s pensions deficit has widened alarmingly - up by over £512m to £1.44bn. John Lewis blames the fall in government bond yields, which has cut the income generated from sovereign debt. The foreign exchange markets are eerily calm this morning, as traders await the Bank of England’s announcement at noon. The pound has dipped by 0.2%, and is bobbing around the $1.32 mark: Newsflash from Zurich: the Swiss central bank has slashed its growth forecasts for the European economy, following the UK’s EU referendum. The Swiss National Bank says: The SNB still expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters. However, the vote for the UK to leave the European Union has caused considerable uncertainty and makes an assessment of the global economic outlook more difficult. The SNB has revised downwards its growth expectations for the UK and the euro area. As regards the global economy, the risks remain to the downside, owing to numerous structural problems. The SNB also cut its inflation forecasts, and left interest rates on hold, at minus 0.75%. Here’s the official tweet confirming that Hinkley is going ahead: And here’s some early reaction: Today’s Bank of England meeting follows a decent set of economic data this week. For example, inflation remained at 0.6% in August, and the jobless rate remained at 4.9% in the May-July quarter. That suggests the economy isn’t being spooked badly by June’s referendum. But there’s still a serious risk of a downturn this autumn; confidence may slide as the process of actually leaving the EU gets underway Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains: As MPC member Kristin Forbes warned in front of the Treasury select committee, the recent run of strong data must be taken cautiously with a potential downturn around the corner as Brexit negotiations begin and the economy processes the consequences. Whilst many believe the bank may have acted too soon, lower rates will facilitate the economy if there is a downturn in data over September and October as we approach the end of the year and near closer to the expected triggering of Article 50. Newsflash: After weeks of indecision, the UK government has decided to press on with the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The decison was made after striking a new agreement with French energy firm EDF. The government says: The Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. However, ministers will impose a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain’s critical infrastructure, which will include nuclear energy and apply after Hinkley. More here: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that Bank of England policymakers could clash over the impact of the Brexit vote at today’s meeting. He writes: While Bank of England governor Mark Carney has claimed that he is “serene” about the MPC’s “sledgehammer” actions last month he has already found himself in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the extent of the Bank’s response. This means that there is virtually no chance of any further policy action on the part of the central bank much before the Autumn Statement in November. If anything the minutes could well show up robust debate particularly amongst those who voted against further QE at the last meeting, and who now have proved to have been correct in their assessment, that it wasn’t necessary, even though one of them Martin Weale has since been replaced by Citibank’s Michael Saunders. Most City economists expect the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold today. But many also expect a fresh rate cut at November’s meeting. A Reuters poll, just released, found that a majority believe borrowing costs will be cut to just 0.1% in two month’s time. They are also less pessimistic about the impact of the Brexit vote on the economy, and now believe there is only a 35% chance of a recession over the next year. That’s down from 60% in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney told MPs last week that he was gloriously ‘serene’ about the Bank of England’s approach to Britain’s Brexit vote. And today, the governor will be corralled with fellow policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee to discuss the state of the UK economy and decide if more stimulus measures are needed. In truth, the Bank is very unlikely to take any fresh measures today - just a month after slashing interest rates to record lows and extending its quantitative-easing bond-buying programme by £60bn. But the minutes of today’s meeting, which will be released at midday, will show the Bank’s thinking on Brexit -- and whether the MPC are split. Last month, three hawkish members of the committee rebelled against Carney - voting against the £60bn QE boost. Might Ian McCafferty and Kristin Forbes give the governor a hard time today (Martin Weale has now left the MPC). Forbes and McCafferty might point to recent economic data that has showed little immediate damage from the Brexit vote - and no sign of the recession which forecasters had predicted (yet anyway). Analysts at RBC Capital Markets reckon the Bank will sit tight today, as the dust settles following June’s referendum. They say: No change in policy is expected this time and if the recent Treasury Select Committee hearing on the August Inflation Report is anything to go by, there isn’t likely to be much of an elaboration on the Committee’s view about post-referendum economic performance. We know the Committee are cautious about placing too much weight on the survey indicators after the vote so it is clear they are taking a longer-term approach. Also coming up today... Here’s the economic calendar: 9.30am: The latest UK retail sales figures, for August 10am: Eurozone inflation for August 12pm: Bank of England interest rate decision &amp; minutes 1.30pm: US retail sales figures, for August We’ll have an eye on Greece today too, as talks continue with its lenders over its bailout programme (and the slow pace of reforms). It’s also a busy morning in the City, with retail group John Lewis and high street chain Next both reporting a drop in sales. But things may be improving for supermarket group Morrisons.

They voted for a spot of nuclear-generated electricity for those thirsty halogen lights under which they all sat. All this heavy lifting was done before lunch on a day when delegates backed bikes and resisted controls on online porn, both on progressive grounds. Such gymnastics are not executed without effort. Liberal Democrats have traditionally been as hostile to nuclear power as they are towards \"unfair\" voting, badger culls and the use of state power to infringe personal liberty on porn or sexuality. Fracking? You won't believe what they voted to do on shale gas fracking, even if they did hedge it with restrictions on the frackers' liberty. But the gravitational pull of coalition office has dragged a party advance guard back to planet earth where they are exploring the flora and fauna of more complex choices associated with being ministers and wannabes. The wannabe to watch was Dr Julian Huppert, MP for Cambridge. He was in the thick of the action all day, on nuclear power, on bikes – less heroic in bike-infested Cambridge than voting for higher tuition fees – and in moving a reference back, so as to avoid an embarrassing defeat on porn for the party establishment. Rarely has this Trotsky look-alike of the Fens looked more like a man of destiny. So the bicycling beardie led a succession of senior Lib Dems to the rostrum to declare their devotion to energy efficiency, cuddly renewables and a zero-carbon world – but not right away. They were like St Augustine on chastity: we need nuclear in the carbon-free energy future we all want, but let's not rush this. The U-turn required the conference – it was pretty full for a wet Sunday morning on the Clyde – to reject option A in the lengthy green growth and jobs motion in favour of option B which included a \"limited\" role for nuclear and shale gas extraction. The St Augustine of windmills was Ed Davey, the post-Huhne energy secretary. \"I am voting for option B, not because I am the minister in charge, not because of the coalition agreement, but because I have changed my mind because of climate change,\" the young bruiser told delegates. What still makes Lib Dem conference debates interesting is that they are not completely rigged. Not all the party's long-trousered faction were dancing to the new tune. Policy wonk Duncan Brack and other speakers who clearly knew stuff, poured scorn of what they see as a shabby costly illusion. With EU neighbours dumping nuclear it will make us \"the thick man of Europe\", raged one. The bikes debate was less tense. Lib Dems love them. Norman Baker, bikes minister, shamelessly promised to stuff their cycle lanes with cash. The only opposition came from cyclists, usually Dutch, who said that biking is much too dangerous in Britain. According to Play School's Lady Floella Benjamin, so is porn. Hers was an impassioned speech, but overwhelmed by 19th century free speech liberalism from assorted LGBT types and by mums. They all said \"get real\" – just like the pro-nuke crowd. Like Hinkley Point online porn has to be part of the new mix. Let us pray the Daily Brute was not watching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/mar/16/toxic-review-jamie-doward-rip-roaring-murder-dirty-money","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-16T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"Toxic review – Jamie Doward’s rip-roaring tale of murder and dirty money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/16/toxic-review-jamie-doward-rip-roaring-murder-dirty-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/mar/16/toxic-review-jamie-doward-rip-roaring-murder-dirty-money","fields":{"headline":"Toxic review – Jamie Doward’s rip-roaring tale of murder and dirty money","bodyText":"Kent, that garden of England, seems an unlikely setting for a financial thriller, particularly one that opens with the discovery of a headless, handless body on a beach, “some soft, bloated sea creature”. But make it the bleak coastline at Dungeness, a “strange, cold, desolate place of shingle”, where the nuclear power station “sat squat… like a toad”, and it begins to feel adequately noir-ish. The mutilated body turns out to be that of a banker, one who worked for the shadowy organisation of Higgs, an American investment bank, which British agents suspect was set up by the CIA to infiltrate terrorist financing. (They’re right: “Even the combined might of the United States’ most powerful security agencies had found it difficult to penetrate the byzantine world of high finance… Tracking weapons-grade plutonium they could do. Tracing hot money was far more difficult.” So they built Higgs Bank.) Kate Pendragon is a money-laundering expert who’s been seconded to MI5. She’s sent to Dungeness to investigate the Higgs employee’s death, and finds herself uncovering terrifying details of a plot to rig the world’s financial markets and bring about global collapse. “MI5 always says that Britain is only three missed meals away from anarchy. Well, this scenario would reveal whether or not they’re correct.” There’s lots going on in Toxic, the debut thriller from Observer journalist Jamie Doward. As well as the CIA boss of Higgs, panicking as the bank he constructed with the best of intentions teeters on the brink of disaster, and the global-market-collapse shenanigans, there’s also an Islamist terrorist cell plotting nuclear devastation. And the Bondishly named Kate Pendragon, brilliant, widowed and lonely, is discovering links and trying to stop it all while her spy bosses, in time-honoured tradition, refuse to believe her. It’s all wonderfully tangled and enjoyably villainous; Doward clearly revels in the drama –melodrama, at times – of the situation he’s created. His terror cell-linked Saudi prince, bent on evil, at one point even strokes his beard, “then twisted the bristles on his chin into a sharp point, like a dagger”. This is a writer who loves his genre. Pendragon is a more nuanced creation, and a pleasingly different sort of heroine, sleeping around indiscriminately in the wake of her husband’s death, running mile after mile to blot it all out, finding herself reluctantly drawn to the Kent detective DCI Sorrenson (“I’ve got Viking blood in me, although I’m Kent through and through”), who’s on the case of the murdered banker. She studies “dense and impenetrable” arrays of numbers and letters and digs to the bottom of the crimes. “People lie but money doesn’t. Intelligence agencies have known that for years. You study where people are moving their cash and you can read their minds.” She’s great. Doward might slightly overdo the harshness of the Dungeness coastline – the power station is both “glowering at the sky, like a giant Easter Island statue”, and resembling “a decrepit spaceship that had landed millennia ago”. Meanwhile, on the beach, “petrified truths hunkered in the shingle like sea lice”; it’s Kent noir. But Toxic is in the main a novel bursting with exuberance, building up to a rip-roaring finale after laying waste to various evil henchmen and misguided agents.

Careful what you wish for","bodyText":"Is this the end? According to the Green MP Caroline Lucas, new nuclear power in this country has been \"completely derailed\". She may not be wrong. She was talking about the decision by Cumbria county council to reject the nuclear waste dump the government had planned. But she could just as well have been responding to the new report by a parliamentary committee, or to the declaration of surrender by Centrica: the last British company with a stake in the technology in the country. Put the three of them together and they add weight to the claims of those who maintain that atomic energy is finished in the United Kingdom. As I've spent much of the past two years defending it, this is a hard admission to make. I don't blame the people of Cumbria for rejecting the dump: the plan was an expensive, erudite and technically advanced dog's breakfast. The location the government had chosen had only one virtue: availability. Or so it thought. The nuclear-friendly county turned out to be no more enthused about mopping up the industry's excretions than the rest of Britain. No dump in Cumbria means no dump anywhere. The whole thing was misdirected anyway: it was a waste of waste. The material the government wants to bury could produce – according to an estimate endorsed by the chief scientific adviser to its energy department – enough low-carbon energy to supply all the UK's electricity needs for 500 years. Integral fast reactors can, in principle, keep recycling nuclear waste until a tiny residue remains, whose components have half-lives of tens rather than millions of years. The government's failure in Cumbria could become an opportunity: to treat the waste as an asset, rather than a liability. But I'm not holding my breath. No one has made atomic energy harder to love than the industry that supplies it. Today its long and colourful record of corner-cutting, incompetence and cover-ups was supplemented by the Commons public accounts committee's report. \"Basic project management failings continue to cause delays and increase costs\" at Sellafield, where the waste is being stored. The past is a mess, the future a thicket. Centrica was reported on Sunday to be pulling out because the cost of building new plants has soared. While other sources of low-carbon energy are getting cheaper, nuclear power – at least of the kind being promoted in Britain – is becoming more expensive. Every year the industry raises its demands, insisting on more lavish guarantees before it builds. The higher the cost, the weaker the argument in favour of the technology becomes. I think the point might now have been reached at which attempts to build the favoured model (the European pressurised reactor) in the UK should be halted until the costs have been reassessed and, preferably, compared with the likely costs of integral fast reactors. There's no point in assembling clunky third-generation power stations if fourth-generation technologies are cheaper and easier to build. Many people will be delighted to read this gloomy assessment. Before you join them, please think about the consequences. Ten days ago, the Japanese government announced that it is abandoning its promise to cut the greenhouse gases the country produces by 25% by 2020. The reason it gave was the shutdown of many of its nuclear plants as a result of the Fukushima disaster. Nuclear power saved about a quarter of a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year in Japan: equivalent to just under half the UK's emissions. Much of it will now be replaced by coal and liquefied gas. Germany also decided to shut down its nuclear power plants after the Fukushima crisis, due to the imminent risk of tsunamis in Bavaria. Last year, as a result, its burning of \"clean coal\" – otherwise known as coal – rose by 5%. That was despite a massive cut in its exports of electricity to other European countries. One estimate suggests that by 2020, Germany will have produced an extra 300 million tonnes of CO2 as a result of its nuclear closure: equivalent to almost all the savings that will be made in the 27 member states as a result of the EU's energy efficiency directive. If the UK fails to replace its nuclear plants, which generate 22% of our electricity, the same thing will happen. Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy – which is essential if we're to have any chance of meeting our climate change targets – is hard enough. Replacing fossil fuels and nuclear power with renewables is harder still. As thermal power plants perversely attract less opposition than wind turbines, the temptation to replace nuclear power with fossil fuels will be overwhelming. Abandoning a proven and reliable low-carbon technology as climate breakdown accelerates is a special form of madness. Flawed and stalled as the nuclear clean-up plans may be, at least they exist. Neither the government nor the fossil fuel companies have any programme for cleaning up carbon dioxide. This waste is, in aggregate, orders of magnitude more dangerous than the materials produced by atomic energy plants, and even harder to make safe. It's a choice of two evils, but one is much worse than the other. I accept that for now, the facts are against me. Enjoy it if you will. But then step back a pace, and consider what it means.

The current directive on the energy performance of buildings, which sets certain standards for construction and refurbishment to ensure good insulation and the use of adequate materials and design, will be overhauled under the proposals, outlined in a leaked discussion document dated 30 January 2015 and seen by the Guardian. Strengthening the regulations is intended to increase energy efficiency within the EU, with a view to meeting stringent new energy targets set for 2030. The proposals for new legislation on energy efficiency would be brought forward this October, but it could take years for any changes in directives to be enforced, giving construction companies time to adjust. A UK government official said that the coalition had already taken action on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from buildings: “The coalition government is committed to implementing a zero-carbon homes standard for new homes from 2016 and a zero-carbon standard for new non-domestic buildings from 2019. “We have already strengthened the minimum energy performance requirements in the building regulations, resulting in an average energy performance improvement of more than 30%.” New legislation to ensure that the EU meets its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030 is also promised, likely to include measures on the bloc-wide emissions trading scheme which covers energy-intensive industries. More research into and support for nuclear power is also on the table, but while the need for much greater progress on carbon capture and storage technology is noted, no actions are set out for how to achieve this. Under the plans outlined in the discussion document, more liquefied gas terminals would be built in northern Europe and gas pipelines across the Mediterranean, to improve security of supply. Urban transport should also be a key area of focus, the Commission believes, as traffic congestion costs Europe about 1% of its GDP every year. The discussion paper on the Energy Union, a plan for closer cooperation among member states on energy production, distribution and consumption, notes that it will be crucial for Europe’s economic competitiveness. Electricity prices to European companies are about 40% higher than those in the US, and gas prices in Europe are three to four times higher, following the vast expansion of shale gas production there. The EU has even lost ground on renewable energy, once a strength: none of the world’s top ten solar companies is European. “These facts can no longer be ignored,” the document says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-13T14:54:47Z","webTitle":"Wind power is cheapest energy, EU analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/13/wind-power-is-cheapest-energy-unpublished-eu-analysis-finds","fields":{"headline":"Wind power is cheapest energy, EU analysis finds","bodyText":"Onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas or nuclear energy when the costs of ‘external’ factors like air quality, human toxicity and climate change are taken into account, according to an EU analysis. The report says that for every megawatt hour (MW/h) of electricity generated, onshore wind costs roughly €105 (£83) per MW/h, compared to gas and coal which can cost up to around €164 and €233 per MW/h, respectively. Nuclear power, offshore wind and solar energy are all comparably inexpensive generators, at roughly €125 per MW/h. “This report highlights the true cost of Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels,” said Justin Wilkes, the deputy CEO of the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). “Renewables are regularly denigrated for being too expensive and a drain on the taxpayer. Not only does the commission’s report show the alarming cost of coal but it also presents onshore wind as both cheaper and more environmentally-friendly.” The paper, which was written for the European commission by the Ecofys consultancy, suggests that the Conservative party plan of restricting new onshore windfarms will mean blocking out the cheapest source of energy when environmental and health facts are taken into consideration. It has been suggested the Tory plan could be done through a cap on onshore wind turbines’ output, lower subsidies or tighter planning restrictions. “Any plans to change policy for onshore wind must be looked at in the context of this report,” said Oliver Joy a spokesman for EWEA. “Investors need long-term visibility. ‘Stop-start’ policies as well as harsh retroactive changes can blindside investors, driving up the risk premium and cost of capital.” The documents’ contents may also be unwelcome in some quarters of the commission, which early today published selective results from it that did not include external health and pollution costs. These showed that renewable energy took €38.3bn of public subsidies in 2012, compared to €22.3bn for gas, coal and nuclear. The EU did however note that if free carbon allowances to polluters were included in the data, it “would reduce the gap between support for renewables and other power generation technologies.” The Ecofys paper’s nuanced evaluation of historical subsidies for coal and nuclear was also not mentioned in the EU press release, which renewable energy associations linked to a fossil fuel lobbying effort ahead of the report’s publication. “Despite decades of heavy subsidies, mature coal and nuclear energy technologies are still dependent on similar levels of public support as innovative solar energy is receiving today,” Frauke Thies, the policy director for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association told the Guardian. “The difference is that costs of solar continue to decrease rapidly. If the unaccounted external costs to society are included, the report demonstrates that support to fossil fuels and nuclear even by far exceeds that to solar.” The EU’s energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, said that the report was only “a first step” to filling gaps in knowledge about the nature of energy subsidies and more reports are likely in the months ahead. The figures for the energy sources in the report are all approximate, as the bar chart listing them is counted in units of €25 MW/h. Last year, a row broke out in Brussels after the German newspaper Suddeutche Zeitung reported that Oettinger had tried to delete figures cited in a commission report showing that in 2011, fossil fuels took €26bn in public subsidies, compared to €35bn for nuclear power and €30bn for renewables."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/may/10/renewables-revolution-is-unstoppable-except-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-10T13:33:33Z","webTitle":"Renewables revolution is unstoppable – except in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/10/renewables-revolution-is-unstoppable-except-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/may/10/renewables-revolution-is-unstoppable-except-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"Renewables revolution is unstoppable – except in the UK","bodyText":"Apple investing $1bn in a giant solar farm in California. Tesla building the world’s biggest battery factory to power electric cars. The Chinese deploying record numbers of wind turbines and solar panels. The renewables revolution looks unstoppable. Except in Britain. Here, two forces – one technical and one political – mean Britain’s dash to cut its carbon emissions and reduce its dependence on Russian coal and Middle Eastern oil is under threat like never before. As the Guardian reports on Sunday, Britain’s creaking electricity grid is close to being overloaded with the wind and solar farms connected to date, such that in large parts of the country the companies that run local grids are either refusing connections or charging millions for a connection for a solar or windfarm because the cables cannot take the extra load. Surely not another embarrassing failure by Britain over decades to invest in its infrastructure, you say? ‘Fraid so. The selloff of the grid companies, many to foreign owners, meant those companies have preferred to pay out dividends rather than invest in new grid capacity. Here is a simple fact: the Germans have around 35 gigawatt peak (GW) of solar capacity on their grid, while we in the UK have got up to about 8 GW and the grid is almost full. The Germans simply have a better grid, helped by the fact that their “feed-in tariff” system of support for renewables had a portion of money reserved for the grid companies to spend on improvements. If the new government is serious about Britain’s legally binding carbon targets, it must put a rocket, and cash, behind the regulator Ofgem and sort the grid out, or the renewables revolution will grind to a halt. But therein lies the rub – this is a government which has spent two years at least trying to slam the brakes on renewables while pushing subsidy towards hyperexpensive nuclear power, and at the North Sea through tax cuts (subsidies by another name). The Tories have been intensively lobbied by the dying fossil fuel industry that money would be better spent on unproven (in the UK) fracking for gas and on pouring billions more of public money chasing the broken nuclear dream. The Conservatives’ dislike of onshore wind and solar power was also driven by hostility to renewables from Ukip. This led to the depressing sight of the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, going around the country tearing up planning permissions already given by councils for wind or solar farms. Luckily, courts have since overturned many of his actions. The government has also slashed support for renewables. The feed-in tariff for smaller solar plants is being slashed by 28% on 1 July, for example. No fear of similar action on the subsidy for Hinkley Point C nuclear station, of course. Onshore wind looks doomed under this new government, shorn of the Liberal Democrats’ support for renewables. Offshore wind and tidal lagoons may still find favour. And solar may limp on, but mainly on rooftops. This is to be welcomed, particularly on large industrial buildings where the tenant uses a lot of power. But it will slow the deployment of solar parks on brownfield sites and other low-grade land where economies of scale kick in. Much will depend on whether the Tories, now rid of the Ukip threat, decide they want to be the greenest government ever, as David Cameron once promised. The solar industry, which I am part of, is not the subsidy junkie that George Osborne thinks it is. That label is for oil, gas, and nuclear. We believe the world needs massive amounts of cheap solar power. The Solar Trade Association calculates we are only a couple of years away from not needing any government support and will soon be cheaper than gas. Solar costs have dropped over 80% in the past five years and are now very competitive. The government needs to avoid killing off solar just before it is ready to stand on its own two feet and compete the fossil fuel boys into the ground. The government could do us a real favour, though – lobby the European commission not to renew the ridiculous minimum price it set two years ago for Chinese solar panels when it expires later this year. This act of folly brought the German solar industry to a halt and slowed the drop in solar costs. The future for renewables in Britain, solar especially, is bright, but it is by no means guaranteed.

Friends of the Earth, which feared the threat of a catastrophic Chernobyl-style meltdown in the UK, is now less concerned. Fear of nuclear armageddon was a driving force for the green movement in the UK – Greenpeace has its name for a reason. But Friends of the Earth have revealed that their old ideological opposition to nuclear has crumbled, to be replaced by a new pragmatic opposition based on cost and build time. In the old days nuclear was fought because of the health threat; now it’s opposed because it’s the wrong option in an energy system designed to tackle climate change. The group denies that its position has shifted – but to me this looks a huge and significant shift – and especially controversial if you work for the UK nuclear industry and have been told for decades that your operations are a clear and present danger to the public. The new position was expressed in an interview with Friends of the Earth’s campaigns director Craig Bennett on Radio 4’s Today Programme on Wednesday. When the presenter asked him to explain the group’s opposition to nuclear power stations he got this reply: “The biggest risk of nuclear power is that it takes far too long to build, it’s far too costly, and distorts the national grid by creating an old model of centralised power generation.” I sat up in bed. Friends of the Earth says the biggest risks of nuclear are that it’s too slow to build; it’s too dear, and would you believe it… it even distorts the grid! The presenter Justin Rowlatt interrupted, sounding surprised: “You’re not worried about the risks from radiation?” Bennett replied: Of course, there are real concerns about radiation, particularly around nuclear waste… but I think it is important how this debate has shifted down the years. The real concern now is how we get on fast with de-carbonising our electricity supply. It’s very clear that nuclear can’t deliver big changes fast. That’s a huge risk if we’re trying to tackle climate change. With renewable technologies and with energy efficiency we could be making a difference within three or four years. So, presented with a free hit against the risk of a nuclear accident, Friends of the Earth’s green warrior swiped at build-time, cost and grid disruption. Further prompted on safety he swiftly shifted to the intractable problem of waste, and did not mention accidents at all. Does that mean if nuclear stations were cheap and quick to build and we could bury the waste somewhere, nuclear would become respectable? Well, the group told me later they were just as concerned about accidents as ever – but the cat was out of the green bag. Friends of the Earth’s shift was signalled in a little-reported policy paper last year which included an independent assessment that coal and maybe even gas generation presented more health risks than nuclear. I have not heard the shift so strikingly articulated before this week. The group’s phones started ringing after I broadcast a news item on their policy shift on Wednesday morning. The matter is highly delicate: the group is locked in an internal battle: some members want it to accept nuclear’s role in the UK’s low-carbon energy mix, whilst others are as passionately anti-nuclear as in the old days of the cold war and nuclear armageddon. Andy Atkins, its director, said on its website: “Friends of the Earth is certainly not now pro-nuclear, we have not changed our position.” Now, I have been tracking the environment movement for 25 years, but to confirm my memory on Friends of the Earth’s historic position I phoned its former director, Tony Juniper. He told me: “In the UK the (nuclear) safety record has been pretty good, so the safety dimension has diminished - and the emphasis in Friends of the Earth has changed.” He said in the early days of the green movement, campaigners opposed the nexus of civilian and military nuclear, but the cold war ended and old accidents at Dounreay in 1977 and Windscale in 1957 receded into memory. Bennett later told me: Perhaps in the past our opposition to nuclear was gut instinct. Our position has now been “refreshed”. We don’t want to close down the UK nuclear industry right away – that would create far too many problems for energy supply over coming decades. But we still very much oppose nuclear new-build. The biggest issue is cost. Bennett told me Friends of the Earth had always deployed a suite of arguments against nuclear power, with the emphasis shifting over time. He was supported by Tom Burke, another former head of Friends of the Earth, who remains strongly anti-nuclear. He says the group’s fundamental opposition to nuclear through the decades has not changed - he says the main thrust of Friends of the Earth’s attack against the industry has fluctuated as different priorities emerged. Other environmentalists, though, have been happy to credit the UK nuclear industry with its safety record – even in some cases to reluctantly embrace the previously hated industry as an ally in the fight against climate change. Stephen Tindale, former Friends of the Earth campaigner and former head of Greenpeace, is a nuclear convert. He told me Friends of the Earth’s position had inarguably changed: Friends of the Earth campaigned to get existing nuclear stations closed down, on safety grounds, as well as opposing new nuclear stations. So the current Friends of the Earth line is a change from the past. And the reason for opposing new nuclear is now cost rather than safety. A change of emphasis, which Tony Juniper accepts has happened, is a change in the campaign. Refreshing a campaign, to use Craig’s word, is a change in the campaign - no point in “refreshing” but leaving it just the same. Friends of the Earth is not pro-nuclear now, but it is less strongly anti-nuclear and on different grounds. I’m still nuke agnostic but for years I have considered nuclear economics more controversial than nuclear safety in the UK, so I’m happy to see the debate move to that ground. Friends of the Earth’s opposition is now less ideological and more functional and that marks a maturing of the green movement which should be celebrated by Friends of the Earth, not denied. I suggest a new rallying cry: “No nuclear new-build – it distorts the National Grid!” • Roger Harrabin is the BBC’s environment analyst.

Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main regional rival, has made clear its unhappiness with the emerging deal. Still, unlike Israel, which flatly opposes any agreement, Saudi Arabia has adopted a more subtle approach. Adel Jubeir, its ambassador to the US, pledged to wait to see the outcome before criticising it. Jubair also conspicuously refused to rule out the kingdom seeking its own nuclear weapons — a pointed reminder to Barack Obama of the nuclear proliferation risks if his Iran strategy does not succeed. The Saudis have hinted for years that they would turn to Pakistan if they felt threatened by a nuclear Iran. Last year they displayed their Chinese-made intermediate-range ballistic missiles — capable of reaching Tehran — at a parade attended by the general who controls Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal. It was, said the Brookings Institution analyst Bruce Riedel, “ a very calculated signal”. But the Saudis have wider concerns: an American-Iranian rapprochement, they fear, will undermine their own influence and security. Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former Saudi intelligence chief, warned in London earlier this month that the romance was now “nearing consummation”. The United Arab Emirates, which has a long-running dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands, is also concerned, suggesting a nuclear agreement will strengthen Tehran’s hand in other areas of Middle Eastern strategic competition that have a Sunni-Shia sectarian tinge – Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and more recently Yemen. “We see the nuclear issue as a tool of Iran’s foreign policy,” one senior official said. Rather than directly confronting the US, the Saudis’ strategy is to improve unity in the Gulf. The obstacles to that are Oman, a long-standing mediator between the US and Iran, and Qatar, which also keeps carefully on the right side of Tehran. The drama over the final stage of the nuclear talks has been heightened by Saudi military operations in Yemen against Houthi rebels it says are backed by Iran. Saudi sources say that obtaining US backing for that was the work of Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef, the powerful Saudi interior minister, who is now second in line to the throne. The degree of Iranian support for the Houthis is, however, hotly disputed. Emile Hokayem, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says there is a tendency in the Gulf to overstate Iran’s role and a tendency in the west to understate it. Tehran’s involvement has been “gradually opportunistic rather than causal,” he said Sir William Patey, a former British ambassador to Riyadh, says some senior Saudis fear a return to the days of the shah before the 1979 Islamic revolution when Iran was America’s preferred regional ally. “Others realise that that is not what’s on offer,” he told the Guardian. “But a nuclear deal could lead to American accommodation to Iranian wishes and they find that worrying. “On the nuclear issue they are on the horns of a dilemma. They don’t want Iran to become a nuclear power and they will be as sceptical as the Israelis are as to whether this is going to be a real deal. On the other hand they won’t want to be forced into making a difficult decision. “They will be sceptical but they won’t be critical and they will learn to manage. Their worst fears won’t be realised. There will be all sorts of obstacles to the sort of Iranian-American relations that the Saudis fear. If Iran could be brought into a regional security arrangement that’s something they would learn to adjust to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2015/oct/03/dear-jeremy-work-problems-solved-careers-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-03T05:59:01Z","webTitle":"Dear Jeremy – your work problems solved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/03/dear-jeremy-work-problems-solved-careers-expert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/oct/03/dear-jeremy-work-problems-solved-careers-expert","fields":{"headline":"Dear Jeremy – your work problems solved","bodyText":"I’ve been working for more than 30 years, but now I’m struggling to find a ‘real’ job I am trying to get a “real” job having worked freelance for the past four years. I have had two good careers: more than 20 years in public service broadcasting, mostly as a radio producer, and more than 10 years in arts project management, including four years as a freelance. With all the cuts to arts funding this is no longer viable as there are so few opportunities and those that exist seem to expect ever more hours for reduced rates. I must have applied for 70 jobs over the past two years; the majority don’t offer an interview or feedback. I have had six interviews and been told I was “a very close second” every time. Last year I paid for some careers advice and rejigged my CV, and am trying to be very flexible and not to look only at “creative” roles. It seemed that one of the few areas that was expanding and advertising multiple roles was in project administration, but I have only once been offered an interview, despite having relevant skills. My natural resilience is starting to wear thin. I am a single parent and still have a teenager at school, so I can’t work abroad at this point. My age might be a factor as managers who interview me are almost invariably 20 years younger. The government expects me to work for another 11 years. Jeremy says My first thought is such an obvious one that it’s inconceivable you haven’t already explored it. Over the past 30 years – and particularly, perhaps, over the past 10 – you must have made a great many contacts in the world of arts project management and related areas. If you haven’t already done so, you should certainly approach them. But I don’t mean simply asking them if they have anything for you. I mean using your knowledge of them and their activities so that you can suggest specific ways in which you might be of use to them. There is nothing demeaning about using personal contacts in this way, and it means you can dispense with most of the introductory stuff that is necessary when making yourself known to others. But do be sure to emphasise how you think you could be of value. Each individual approach needs to be very carefully researched and thought through. Next, I notice you’ve rejigged your CV in an attempt to be more “flexible”. This, theoretically, means you’re eligible for a wider selection of jobs, but it can also mean you come across as a bit bland. Then there’s the age question. You’ll never be sure – no one’s going to admit it and it may not even be a conscious bias – but it is probably a factor. You need to take it into account. All of which suggests to me that, rather than broadening your appeal, you should narrow it. Your age licenses you to claim a wealth of experience in particular areas that could be of particular interest to particular projects. Ask yourself, looking back over your past 30 years, what specific knowledge and skills have you, however accidentally, accumulated? What difficulties have you overcome on behalf of your clients? What tricks of the trade have you mastered? In other words, what do you know that few other people know? It doesn’t have to be of universal appeal, but it’s almost certain to be of unusual interest to some. Your task is to work backwards from that piece of self-analysis then apply it to those potential employers who are most likely to see its relevance to them. It should certainly earn you interviews. Readers say • A clearer focus on your unique skills is needed – your USPs. This “I have had 20 years of doing something” is often simply not hard-hitting enough in a crowded market full of people who know how to push those buttons.

A quick Google search yields hundreds of contracting jobs in project management roles. IT is especially buoyant, if this is an area where your skill sets will stretch.

I’m 22 and just graduated with a first class physics degree. However, I didn’t do the degree because I had a passion for it. I did it because I could and thought it would sound good. I’ve managed to get on a business consulting graduate scheme, which again I don’t have a massive interest in, but I took the job because it sounded quite good and with all the news about unemployed graduates I thought I was lucky. My problem is I know that I’m wasting my time, but don’t know what else I want or should be doing – probably because I haven’t done it yet. Jeremy says I’ve seldom read a letter so devoid of enthusiasm, yet I can’t believe you’ve reached the age of 22 without once becoming enthusiastic about anything. I suspect you think of a career – physicist, lawyer, financial adviser – and decide you don’t much like the sound of them, when instead you should be finding out what those careers entail and what those people actually do all day. It varies hugely. Physicists, it’s widely believed, are particularly good at problem-solving. Almost all interesting jobs value those who are good at solving problems. Simon Singh, a science writer, goes further: “I reckon that physicists can do pretty much anything. Our training can be applied to almost any activity, and it allow us to see things in ways that might not be obvious to others.” So stop thinking about careers and concentrate on activities. At school and university what sorts of activities did you find most involving, enjoyable and mentally rewarding? Then dig deep enough into various occupations and identify those that value people with exactly those aptitudes. I think you’ll find you haven’t wasted your time at all. Readers say • Within the next five years you should do your job well and maximise as much income as you can; research and explore various career paths including entrepreneurship; and build your network. By then you’re 27, more mature, more financially stable, with five years’ of work experience and a strong professional network – you’ll be in a solid position to answer your own question. Avoid debt, because that’s what ties people to jobs they hate. lizbutterfly • There’s no need to panic – many people go through various different jobs, types of work, have no real idea what they “want to do” for a long time. But it is always easier to get a job from the position of already having one, so you are in a good position. carsonmccullers • As someone with a physics degree, it is one of the most flexible.

The power network is officially bringing forward by a year a scheme to tap additional capacity to cope with closures of nuclear, gas, coal and oil power stations and unexpected plant repairs. The prospect of power shortages is likely to alarm ministers, who are concerned that an already depleted system could be exposed by a small number of temporary shutdowns at crucial plants. Britain is already facing a power capacity crunch as ageing and polluting stations are shutting down, while new plants are slow to start operating because of a government overhaul of energy policy. National Grid said it was extending its search for additional sources of temporary supplies to keep the lights on and support heavy industries that use large amounts of electricity. It is looking for additional supplies for the two months before and after Christmas. \"At this stage we don't know if these reserve services will be needed, but they could provide an additional safeguard,\" said Cordi O'Hara, National Grid's director of UK market operations. The grid cited emergency shutdowns at two UK nuclear power stations operated by French firm EDF and fires at a large coal-powered plant and and another fuelled by biomass. National Grid formally launched a tender for its Supplemental Balancing Reserve on Tuesday, asking power generators how much spare capacity they could provide to fill a potential supply gap. The fires were at E.ON's biomass-fuelled Ironbridge plant in Shropshire and SSE's Ferrybridge plant in Yorkshire, forcing them to reduce output; while a power plant in Barking, east London is to close and there have been production problems at EDF Energy's Heysham and Hartlepool nuclear power stations. If the network operator decides SBR is necessary this winter, it will launch a competitive tender for a specific amount of spare capacity. Power generators would have to be available to provide additional electricity between 7am and 9pm from November to February. The new back-up capacity mechanism is in parallel with a programme that allows National Grid to ask contracted users – mostly factories – to reduce electricity demand when the system is strained. • This article was amended on 5 September 2014.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the Commons public accounts committee (PAC), which will question civil servants and the NDA about the costs next week, said the rise was astonishing and railed at managerial incompetence at the plant. “Despite my committee’s calls in February 2014 for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to make big improvements, the cost of cleaning up the nuclear waste at Sellafield continues to soar,” Hodge said. “The authority’s work at Sellafield is not just costing more, it is also taking much longer than planned, and for 2014-15 it looks like work will be behind schedule for the fourth year running. “My committee concluded in February 2014 that the authority had not demonstrated why Nuclear Management Partners’ ownership of Sellafield provides value for money. Yet the authority only took the decision in January 2015 to terminate this contract with Nuclear Management Partners, which is almost a year after my committee told it to do so.” The NDA brought in NMP seven years ago to help improve the plant’s performance. One of the members of the NMP consortium is Areva, the French engineering firm that has worked on the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The consortium also includes URS of the US and Amec of the UK. Officials from the NDA, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, NMP and Sellafield Ltd will appear before the public accounts committee on 11 March. In its updated report, the NAO said the estimate of decommissioning the site had been increasing sharply in recent years. “The authority considers that the increase in its lifetime cost estimates is mainly because it now has a better understanding of the scale and nature of the risks and challenges on the site,” said the report. “In particular, it reflects an improving understanding of the challenges, potential technical solutions and uncertainties still involved in the decommissioning projects and programmes to retrieve, package and store high risk, hazardous materials. It also reflects a more realistic assessment of the level of efficiencies achievable within the plan.” Chris Jukes, regional officer of the GMB union, said: “Poor value for money, poor top NMP management and a lack of grip on key issues in an essential area for the UK energy sector, as well as the UK economy, have led to unbelievable decisions on expenditure. “The PAC has undertaken some important work of scrutiny and we expect answers from NMP to some basic questions for our members in Sellafield, their families and communities.”A spokesman for the NDA said: “The primary reason for increases in costs and schedule is because we now have a better understanding of the technical approach necessary to tackle these unique facilities. “Before deciding whether to cancel the contract with Nuclear Management Partners, the NDA needed to first satisfy itself and government that it had an alternative model that would give greater confidence of delivering progress and value for money. We have been through a thorough process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/04/british-team-designs-high-tech-kites-to-harness-wind-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-04T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Let's go fly a kite: British team looks to harness wind power from the skies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/04/british-team-designs-high-tech-kites-to-harness-wind-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/04/british-team-designs-high-tech-kites-to-harness-wind-energy","fields":{"headline":"Let's go fly a kite: British team looks to harness wind power from the skies","bodyText":"“Oh wow! Look at that, it’s really hoofing some power out now,” beams Bill Hampton, looking up at his outsize kite as it swoops over a wheat field on the Essex coast. The purple prototype is, Hampton hopes, a step towards his vision of scores of huge kites flying over the sea in formation and generating clean, affordable electricity. The test site for Kite Power Solutions (KPS) is an apt one for technology innovation, with the disused airfield lying in the shadow of one of the UK’s first nuclear power stations at Bradwell, and a few flat fields away from new wind farms whose blades turn slowly in the gentle breeze. But, huddling behind a second world war pill box to observe the latest test flight, Hampton admits his motivation to found the company was more for the technical challenge than environmental awareness. He spent 18 years working in the exclusive super-yacht industry, creating the bespoke equipment that billionaires dream up for their huge boats. “You’d sit with the designers and they’d say ‘we want a swimming pool but we want it to turn into a dance floor’,” he says, explaining how he learned to build novel gadgets from scratch. “I then had a real moment – you are making toys to go on someone’s toy. It’s great when you are young, but why are you doing it?” He recalls working night and day with his team to get a yacht ready to cross the Atlantic in time for a party in the Caribbean. “I walked off that site and thought ‘I don’t want to do this again’.” Now Hampton’s enthusiasm is for the high-tech kites his company is developing and he is being taken seriously: oil giant Shell and the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change have contributed to the £3m invested so far. The ambition is to harvest the strong, reliable winds found offshore, and away from anti-turbine protesters. But planting tall turbines into the sea is expensive, both in the steel and concrete needed and the specialised boats required to install and maintain them. Instead, Hampton wants to tether two kites to each mooring to capture the wind. Each kite flies in a figure of eight, drawing out the tether and generating power at the winch. When it has reached its maximum height – likely to be 750m – the kite switches to a hover-like mode, where there is little stress on the tether and it can be winched back in ready for the next run, using just a fraction of the power already generated. Power is delivered continuously because one kite is generating as the other is winched in. Ultimately, the plan is to have scores of kites flying in formation, all automatically controlled using custom-made software. Hampton calls the kites “wings”, due to their tilting control surfaces, and at full-scale they will be 40m wide with 2-3MW capacity, about the same as a 100m-tall conventional turbine. So far, KPS have tested prototypes of 7m. They are testing each part of the development in turn, such as avoiding collisions and automated take-offs and landings. KPP employs 16 people, including experts in aeronautics, neural network software, mechanical engineers, atmospheric physics and sail makers. Hampton is not concerned about storms: “The kites fly at 100-150mph, so storms are all in a day’s work.” But lightning is a worry, given each kite will have an on-board computer as back-up to ground controls, but he says the kites can be brought down to safety in minutes. If the wind drops away for a short time, a small propeller is being tested to keep the kite coasting aloft. Mission control at the Bradwell site is a converted mobility bus, now crammed with computer screens, joysticks and doughnuts. Here Hampton explains that KPS are far from alone in attempting to develop kites and wings to lower the cost of wind power. “If we were the only people doing it, I’d be really worried,” says Hampton. The most interesting from an engineering perspective, says Hampton, is Makani, a project backed by the deep-pocketed Google. It involves a very high-tech wing collecting wind power at altitude using attached rotors, then cabling the power to the ground. “I desperately want them to get there,” Hampton says. “It will help people see this is a viable market.” Another company, Altaeros Energies, founded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, aims to use a tube-shaped helium balloon to suspend a wind turbine in the air. Ampyx Power is developing a glider and SkySails is focusing on a simple single-kite and winch system. There is even a company, Minesto, developing an underwater kite that flies in tidal currents to generate power, which has just been awarded €13m of EU funding for testing in north Wales. “Offshore wind is currently too expensive, although costs are coming down through evolutionary change,” says David Sanders, director of innovation at the Carbon Trust. “But wind kites have the potential to be revolutionary and bring a step-change reduction in costs.” Sanders says backing such technologies carries a big risk, with $50-100m needed to get to commercial scale: “You need to gamble very large amounts of money, but if it works out you could make a huge amount of money. I would love to see these sorts of radical innovations get funding from somewhere, whether that’s governments or large companies. Not all of them will work, but some will and they are really needed.” On KPS, Sanders says: “They are on track – but they have a long way to go.” The company is looking for $10m in 2016, says KPS business development director David Ainsworth, with the aim of selling their first commercial onshore systems in 2019 and having a demonstration array in the ocean before 2025. Ainsworth spent a decade with tidal power pioneers Marine Current Turbines, who installed an underwater turbine at Strangford Loch and have now been bought by engineering giant Siemens. He is alongside Hampton watching the test flights at the Bradwell Bay airfield, which has its own history of novel technology. During the second world war, hundreds of the all-wooden Mosquito fighter-bombers flew out of the airfield to fight the Nazis. On the question of whether the public will warm to the sight of kite-powered wind farms more than some have to turbines, Ainsworth makes an aviation link: “Everyone loves the Red Arrows, so having 200 kites flying in formation would be quite spectacular.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/03/green-tech-key-to-tackling-climate-change-says-uks-climate-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-03T16:42:10Z","webTitle":"Focus on green tech to tackle climate change, says Sir David King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/03/green-tech-key-to-tackling-climate-change-says-uks-climate-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/03/green-tech-key-to-tackling-climate-change-says-uks-climate-adviser","fields":{"headline":"Focus on green tech to tackle climate change, says Sir David King","bodyText":"Green technology should be as much a focus of tackling climate change as the United Nations negotiations leading up to a crunch conference in Paris this December, the UK’s top foreign office adviser on climate said on Tuesday. Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser to the UK government and now the special representative for climate change, said: “Technology is moving ahead very rapidly. I think we need to focus not only on the details of the negotiations, but also on what the technological revolution is going to bring to us.” He cited as an example new biofuels technology that can turn agricultural waste into ethanol, and uses the methane produced as a byproduct to power the factory in which it is created. If this were “translated” to be used widely in China, for instance, the potential would be “massive ... enormous”, he said. As the world’s governments gear up for the Paris talks, Sir David said the UK was “leading the world” in climate diplomacy, forming close associations with other governments and among officials as a key focus of the Foreign Office’s efforts. He said the foreign secretary had “protected” the budget for this diplomatic push against swingeing cuts that have affected other parts of the department. At Paris, governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on the climate that would set national targets for curbs on greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when current targets run out. Governments are scheduled to produce their targets this month, with Switzerland last week becoming the first nation to submit its proposals to the UN. The European Union, China and the US have also publicly set out proposals, though these have yet to be formally codified into the UN process. The EU has pledged to cut emissions by 40% relative to 1990 levels by 2030, while China’s emissions will peak by 2030 and the US will cut greenhouse gases by 25% to 28% by 2025. Professor Qi Ye, a leading Chinese adviser on energy policy, added that China’s emissions might peak sooner as the hope was for a peak year “around 2030”, and that the country was moving ahead rapidly on renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear power and reducing coal consumption, which fell by 3% last year partly because of slowing economic growth but also from the effects of policy. He pointed to recent adverse publicity on air pollution, which is a major problem in Chinese cities and was recently highlighted by Chai Jing in a much-seen internet video, and that this would also provide a strong spur to cleaning up greenhouse gas emissions. This approach, of emphasising the “co-benefits” to health from dealing with climate change as well as air and water pollution, was gaining ground, he said. Diplomacy is stepping up in the lead-up to the crunch talks later this year. Todd Stern, the US envoy for climate change, told journalists last week it was important not to make snap judgements on the outcome of the Paris talks, the effects of which he said would take several years to be felt. He warned that Paris was a crucial stage for global negotiations on a new climate agreement: “With as much teed up as is teed up now, if the thing really were to not get over the finish line, I think that would be a consequential thing for the UN. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Prof Qi and Sir David were speaking at an IPPR event in central London on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2015/jul/30/readers-suggest-the-10-best-beach-moments-in-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-30T16:24:04Z","webTitle":"Readers suggest the 10 best beach moments in culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/30/readers-suggest-the-10-best-beach-moments-in-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jul/30/readers-suggest-the-10-best-beach-moments-in-culture","fields":{"headline":"Readers suggest the 10 best beach moments in culture","bodyText":"Baywatch (1989-2001) Suggested by hoppo “No mention of Baywatch?” scoffed hoppo, who may or may not have spilt hot coffee all over their “I Heart Hasselhoff” T-shirt before leaving a nonplussed message in the comments section. Indeed, who could forget the silly, sunkissed vision of the Los Angeles County lifeguards, who were world-beaters when it came to retina-burning grins and slo-mo shoreline runs (and creating body-image issues for a generation of viewers). Over 11 seasons, one never tired of that rip-roaring theme tune – let’s hope they keep it for the Dwayne Johnson-starring film adaptation that’s currently in production. Remember (Walking in the Sand) – The Shangri-Las, 1965 Suggested by mikedow The beach is the perfect setting for the songs of 1960s girl group the Shangri-Las and their brand of diaphanous melancholy. Cascading waves and the twitter of seagulls complement the finger-clicking chorus to their 1965 debut single, as the then 17-year-old singer Mary Weiss warbles: “Walking in the sand/ Walking hand in hand/ The night was so exciting/ Smile was so inviting.” It reached the top five in the Billboard charts, and was covered by Aerosmith in 1980. Derek Jarman’s garden in Dungeness Suggested by PhilSm Following Derek Jarman’s HIV-positive diagnosis on 22 December 1986, the pioneering gay director moved into a black fisherman’s cottage in Dungeness, Kent. “I’m sure there is footage of him and Tilda Swinton and others cavorting on Dungeness beach in some experimental films,” said Yosserian, correctly referencing Jarman’s 1990 film The Garden, in which a homosexual couple are arrested, tortured and killed, before noting that “Dungeness is the UK’s only designated desert”. It is a bleak and barren environment situated beside a nuclear power station, and while the house is closed to the public, visitors still go to pay homage from a distance. Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) Suggested by NeitherYankNorBrit It is difficult to imagine that Spielberg’s shark-infested blockbuster has improved anyone’s experience of the seaside – though the fearful frisson that comes with swimming through a dark patch of ocean is a silver lining. Cinephiles have no such practical problems, with NeitherYankNorBrit recommending: “Any of the scenes in Jaws, although the opening scene is my favourite.” Yosserian concurs, but prefers “[Michael] Caine’s character fight” towards the end, when his character flees from Jaws into a seaplane, loudly proclaiming: “Oh shit!” Observer film critic Mark Kermode basked in the 1975 summer classic’s legacy for a story earlier this year. Brighton Rock (Graham Greene, 1938) Suggested by RabBurnout Graham Greene’s seventh novel is not your conventional, breezy holiday read, even if it is set along the Sussex coast. “People don’t change. It’s like those sticks of rock: bite it all the way down, you’ll still read Brighton,” are the most famous words of the 1938 thriller, which meditates on the nature of sin via the murderous confrontations of 17-year-old gangster Pinkie Brown. RabBurnout gave his approval, while also acknowledging “the original [1947] film starring Richard Attenborough”. An arcane web of duplicity, it may be slight on plot, but its characters are brilliantly sketched. Planet of the Apes (Franklin J Schaffner, 1968) Suggested by sun2day Franklin J Schaffner’s beastly sci-fi brims with subtext and social commentary, imagining a world where the superior beings are the apes. It marks the second appearance of California’s Zuma Beach on this list – after Baywatch, which was shot there many times – in the film’s dramatic denouement, as recommended by sun2day. In it, the leading man du jour, Charlton Heston, after lead roles in Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil (1958) and Ben-Hur (1959) laments humanity’s destructive myopia, knees sunk into sand: “Damn you, damn you all to hell!” The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (1976-79) Suggested by ID3334123 During the opening credits of this cult 1970s TV series, 46-year-old sales executive Reginald Iolanthe Perrin (Leonard Rossiter) decides to end his miserable existence – stripping naked and swimming out to sea in Dorset, before awkwardly losing his nerve. Adapted from David Nobbs’s book trilogy, it follows Perrin’s disenchantment with dull suburban life and a career at Sunshine Desserts that is completely bereft of job satisfaction. Grim it may first appear, but through the prism of pitch-black humour, it becomes a very British way of beachgoing (and life). Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004) Suggested by Skoolyad A product of the surreal chemistry between director Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, who co-wrote the script, the beach becomes a peculiar hinterland, shorn of its usual hedonistic connotations. We see former lovers Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), for example, play around on a snow-covered shore after hiring a futuristic hi-tech firm called Lacuna to remove memories of each other – another time, jarringly, they are there in a bed. “Sand is overrated,” mumbles Joel at one point, in the winner of 2005’s Best Original Screenplay Oscar. “It’s just ... tiny little rocks.” The Outsider (Albert Camus, 1942) Suggested by Steff Clarke The stifling heat and the oppressive glare of the sun experienced by The Outsider’s troubled existentialist figure Meursault reflect on a warped impression of the world – a postcolonial dystopia. While on a visit to a friend’s beach house, he ends up murdering an Arab on the beach at Algiers merely because the sun gets in his eyes. “I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I’d been happy,” he chillingly recounts in the climatic scene. “Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.” The 400 Blows (François Truffaut, 1959) Suggested by Yosserian The adventures of Antoine Doinel, François Truffaut’s charming on-screen mouthpiece, began in glorious fashion with this autobiographical gem of the French new wave – later to be joined by Stolen Kisses (1968), Bed and Board (1970) and Love On The Run (1979). It centres around the 14-year-old Doinel, portrayed by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who cheekily swindles his way through life by hook or by crook. Yosserian hails the film’s poignant final scene, in which Doinel arrives at the beach after running from the police: “Brilliant existential moment, running to the sea, and then turning away from it, looking into camera, and freezing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2013/dec/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidy-european-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-18T13:39:12Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C nuclear subsidy plan queried by European commission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidy-european-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/dec/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidy-european-commission","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C nuclear subsidy plan queried by European commission","bodyText":"The European commission has started an investigation into UK plans to subsidise the construction and operation of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, in a challenge to the government's plans to overhaul Britain's creaking energy infrastructure. On the day royal assent was finally given to the coalition's controversial Energy Act, the EU's executive arm expressed doubts that British ministers could justify state aid to nuclear which it estimated could reach £17bn. The EC warned of the risk of a \"subsidy race\" between member states and Joaquín Almunia, vice-president for competition policy, described the aid package as a complex measure of an unprecedented nature and scale. \"The commission therefore needs to investigate thoroughly its impact on the UK and the EU internal energy markets, and is requesting all interested parties to submit their observations.\" The British government has always denied that the financial support is a subsidy and said it was needed for the proposed nuclear plant because the market is faced with an unprecedented situation, the aims of combating climate change and assuring energy security. But there has been speculation in Brussels that the commission has made up its mind that the Hinkley move is in effect an unfair subsidy, with the only question being what kind of changes or sanctions it may demand or impose on Britain. Günther Oettinger, the European union's energy commissioner, warned last month that the 35-year subsidy regime \"may be a problem\" while earlier describing the UK nuclear project in an unguarded moment as \"Soviet\" in style. The financial support for EDF and its Chinese partners includes a £10bn loan guarantee plus an inflation-linked \"strike price\" of £92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years – twice the current price for electricity in Britain. Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, shrugged off the commission announcement, saying it was standard for large investment projects and was always part of the process for Hinkley. \"We will use this period to demonstrate how the project meets state aid rules and provides good value for consumers while cutting carbon in the energy sector.\" EDF, the French state-owned company that will operate Hinkley Point C, said it was looking forward to putting its case direct to Brussels. \"This investigation gives the government and others the opportunity to show that electricity market reform in the UK is essential to deliver the investment needed for the country's low carbon energy future at a price that is fair for customers,\" it said a statement. \"Without this reform, the investment will not take place. The Hinkley Point C agreement is proof that this reform works to attract the investment needed to secure Britain's future electricity supply.\" The Energy Act not only underpins the Hinkley strike price but also provides a range of incentives including support for wind power and biomass to attract £110bn needed to replace current generating capacity and upgrade the national grid. Critics have attacked it for being too complex and expensive to implement. The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, appointed Dermot Nolan as its next chief executive. Nolan will join Ofgem in March from the Commission for Energy Regulation in Ireland and comes at a time of unprecedented political heat around soaring bills and alleged power market malfunction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/15/65-canadian-scholars-draw-up-a-roadmap-to-curb-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-15T10:25:30Z","webTitle":"Price on carbon key to Canada tackling global warming, say researchers | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/15/65-canadian-scholars-draw-up-a-roadmap-to-curb-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/15/65-canadian-scholars-draw-up-a-roadmap-to-curb-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Price on carbon key to Canada tackling global warming, say researchers","bodyText":"65 researchers from provinces across Canada have published a report, Acting on Climate Change, that details how the country can successfully decarbonize its electric grid to slow global warming. The team unanimously endorsed putting a price on carbon pollution as a key strategy. Without a carbon fee, the price of electricity on the market doesn’t reflect its true costs to society. This is a market failure that economists call an “externality,” where the costs associated with a product (in this case, damages incurred via climate change) aren’t captured in its market price. Instead they’re paid by taxpayers in what could be considered a massive subsidy to the fossil fuel industry. Most economists support putting a price on carbon pollution in order to correct this market failure. Acting on Climate Change notes that this could be accomplished with either a carbon tax or cap and trade system. So far, the province of British Columbia has implemented a highly popular and successful revenue-neutral carbon tax, while the province of Québec has adopted a cap and trade system in coordination with California as part of the Western Climate Initiative, and Ontario has just announced that it will also implement a carbon cap and trade system. In addition to carbon pricing, some other key policies suggested in the report include, Integrate the oil and gas production sector in climate policies Include aggressive goals for low-carbon electricity production in federal and provincial climate action plans Adopt a multi-level energy policy with energy efficiency and cooperation in electrification at its core Throughout Canada, rapidly adopt low-carbon transportation strategies Support fisheries, forestry and agriculture practices offering opportunities to limit greenhouse gas emissions, enhance carbon sequestration, and protect biological diversity and water quality For example, the report notes that Canada has substantial renewable energy resources at its disposal. To date, 10.8% of its energy is supplied by hydroelectricity, 5.8% from renewables, and 9.1% from nuclear power. From the fossil fuel sector, 30.8% is supplied by natural gas, 36.4% from oil, and 7.1% from coal. It says: With vast, already installed hydropower capacity and rich potential in undeveloped renewable energy sources that could be harnessed to produce electricity, Canada could rapidly move away from fossil fuels in the electricity sector. This transformation, which would put Canada at the forefront of green electricity internationally, could also provide significant cost-savings and give leverage to a number of Canadian industrial sectors. However, by exploiting its renewable energy resources, Canada could shift to a more low-carbon energy mix relatively quickly. Along with the other policy suggestions made in Acting on Climate Change, Canada could keep up with the carbon pollution cuts and pledges made by its neighbor to the south. Because renewable energy resources are plentiful, we believe that Canada could reach 100% reliance on low carbon electricity by 2035. This makes it possible, in turn, to adopt a long-term target of at least 80% reduction in emissions by the middle of the century, consistent with Canada’s international climate mitigation responsibility. In the short-term, we think Canada, in keeping with its historical position of aligning with United States’ targets, could adopt a 2025 target of 26-28% GES reductions relative to our 2005 levels. Thus far Canada has been unsuccessful in meeting its pledges to cut carbon pollution. The country was on track to miss its target under the Kyoto Protocol before withdrawing from the pledge, and is now expected to miss its target under the Copenhagen Accords. Since the report focuses on the electricity grid, it doesn’t discuss the Alberta tar sands. Expanding crude oil production from the tar sands has seemed to be a higher priority to the Canadian government than slowing global warming, and in fact the two goals seem incompatible. By shifting its focus away from the tar sands and instead following the Acting on Climate Change roadmap, Canada could get back on track to meet its pledges to address the growing threats posed by global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/18/fukushima-nuclear-power-workers-spent-fuel-rod-removal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-18T11:40:55Z","webTitle":"Fukushima workers start removing spent fuel rods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/18/fukushima-nuclear-power-workers-spent-fuel-rod-removal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/18/fukushima-nuclear-power-workers-spent-fuel-rod-removal","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima workers start removing spent fuel rods","bodyText":"Workers have begun the delicate task of removing fuel rods from a storage pool at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, more than two and a half years after the facility suffered a triple meltdown after being hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami. The operation to remove more than 1,331 used fuel assemblies and 202 unused assemblies began on Monday and is expected to take just over a year. Decommissioning the entire site is expected to take at least 30 years. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], said the fuel removal was an important step in decommissioning the plant, which experienced multiple meltdowns and explosions after Japan's north-east coast was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Tepco brushed off fears that removing the rods from near the roof of reactor No 4 could cause a serious accident. Some experts have warned that a collision involving the fuel assemblies, a sudden loss of coolant water or another earthquake could cause a chain reaction and release huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. Reactor No4 was closed for routine maintenance at the time of the disaster and so did not suffer a meltdown. But a hydrogen explosion on 15 March 2011 blew the walls and roof off the reactor building, leaving it vulnerable to further damage from earthquakes. The utility has since reinforced the building with a huge steel canopy and insists the structure can withstand seismic events of the same intensity that shook the plant in March 2011. But it conceded that the fuel assemblies needed to be moved to a safer storage site as soon as possible. \"After the explosion, one big challenge was to deal with the spent fuel pool, because if the water evaporated it would cause a radioactive cloud stretching all the way to Tokyo, which would have to be evacuated,\" Yuichi Okamura, deputy manager of the water treatment department at Fukushima Daiichi, told the Guardian on Monday. \"It was a big challenge, so today is a big success for the cleanup teams.\" Yoshimi Hitosugi, a Tepco spokesman, said: \"This is an important moment. It is one big step towards decommissioning the reactor.\" He added that three fuel assemblies had been discovered that were damaged prior to the tsunami and measures were being taken to deal with them. Hitosugi said the firm was confident that the workers would be able to cope with any debris caused by the explosion that remained in the spent fuel pool, adding that it would not compromise the fuel removal operation. Tepco's president, Naomi Hirose, said the fuel extraction \"represents the beginning of a new and important chapter in our work\", and thanked plant workers for the \"ingenuity, diligence, and courage that made this achievement possible\". The utility believes that a specially chosen team of 36 men will need until late 2014 to remove all of the fuel assemblies from the pool, located 130 feet above ground, and place them in submerged protective casks. The casks will then be taken to ground level and transported to a more stable storage pool nearby. Each cask can hold up 22 assemblies comprising between 60 and 80 fuel rods. Workers will remove the fresh fuel assemblies first because they are easier to handle. \"The extraction work started at 3:18pm and the first fuel completed its extraction from the fuel rack to the cask placed inside the pool at 3:57pm as planned, following thorough safety preparations with the co-operation of many partner companies and individual workers,\" Tepco said in a statement. But antinuclear campaigners have voiced concern over Tepco's ability to complete the work without incident following revelations that up to 300 tonnes of radioactive water are leaking from the site into the sea every day. The utility also came under fire this summer for installing poorly designed tanks that leaked toxic water. \"We are concerned that Tepco may not be capable of conducting this risky operation safely, and that there are significant risks involved in this operation,\" said Kazue Suzuki, a nuclear campaigner with Greenpeace Japan. \"Tepco's inability to solve the problems with leaking tanks that store contaminated water, and the continued flow of contaminated water from the site to the ocean adds to our concerns about its ability to handle this dangerous operation to remove spent fuel. \"If Tepco makes mistakes again and can't handle this task, workers could be exposed to excessive levels of radiation and in a worst-case scenario there could be a massive new release of radiation to the atmosphere.\" The head of Japan's nuclear safety agency, Shunichi Tanaka, recently warned that removing the fuel involved huge risks, particularly if any attempt were made to force fuel assemblies that have become impeded by debris. \"The process involves a very large risk potential,\" he said. \"In a sense, it is more risky than the radioactive water crisis.\" According to Tepco, the specially designed handling equipment has inbuilt mechanisms to prevent the fuel from being accidentally dropped, and that even breakages in a small number of fuel assemblies would not pose a risk to areas around the plant. Local authorities in Fukushima will send emergency notifications to residents via mobile phones and other devices in the event of an accident. Even if the fuel removal ends without a hitch, Tepco faces the even more difficult task of locating and removing melted fuel from deep inside the three reactors that suffered meltdown. Radiation levels inside those reactors are still too high for humans to enter, and the technology has yet to be developed to carry out the unprecedented operation. As a result, Tepco says it will not be able to begin removing melted fuel from those reactors until 2020 at the earliest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/21/farce-hinckley-nuclear-reactor-haunt-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"The farce of the Hinkley C nuclear reactor will haunt Britain for decades | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/farce-hinckley-nuclear-reactor-haunt-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/farce-hinckley-nuclear-reactor-haunt-britain","fields":{"headline":"The farce of the Hinkley C nuclear reactor will haunt Britain for decades","bodyText":"Seven years ago, I collected all the available cost estimates for nuclear power. The US Nuclear Energy Institute suggested a penny a kilowatt hour. The Royal Academy of Engineering confidently predicted 2.3p. The British government announced that in 2020 the price would be between 3 and 4p. The New Economics Foundation guessed that it could be anywhere between 3.4 and 8.3p; 8.3 pence was so far beyond what anyone else forecast that I treated it as scarcely credible. It falls a penny short of the price now agreed by the British government. I still support nuclear power. I believe that to abandon our primary source of low carbon energy during a climate change crisis would be madness. It would mean replacing atomic plants with something much worse. We should, of course, cut our profligate demand for power as much as possible. But if transport and heating are to be powered by low-carbon electricity, total demand is likely to rise even with the most parsimonious use of energy. And we should make as much use as we can of renewables. But the biggest onshore wind schemes could supply only a fraction of the low-carbon power a nuclear plant can produce. For example, the controversial deployment in mid-Wales would generate just one 14th of the proposed output of Hinkley C. Offshore wind has greater potential, but using it to displace most of our fossil fuel generation is a tough call, even when it's balanced with a nuclear power baseload. Without that you would explore the limits of feasibility. If every square metre of south facing domestic roof and suitable wall in the UK were covered with solar panels, they would produce 9% of the energy currently provided by fossil fuels. The harsh reality is that less nuclear means more gas and coal. Coal burning produces, among other toxic emissions, heavy metals, acid sulphates and particulates, which cause a wide range of heart and lung diseases. Even before you take the impacts of climate change into account, coal is likely to kill more people every week than the Chernobyl disaster has killed since 1986. It astonishes me to see people fretting about continuing leaks at Fukushima, which present a tiny health risk even to the Japanese, while ignoring the carcinogenic pollutants being sprayed across our own country. But none of this means that we should accept nuclear power at any cost. And at Hinkley Point the cost is too high. Nils Pratley warned in the Guardian last week that \"if Hinkley Point's entire output is tied to the rate of inflation for 40 years, we could be staring at a truly astronomical cost by the end of the contract.\" The City analyst he consulted reassured him that \"the government surely can't be that dumb\". Oh yes? Payment to the operators, the government now tells us, will be \"fully indexed to the consumer prices index\". Guaranteed income for corporations, risk assumed by the taxpayer: this deal looks as bad as any private finance initiative contract. That's not the only respect in which the price is too high. A fundamental principle of all development is that we should know how the story ends. In this case no one has the faintest idea. Cumbria – the only local authority which seemed prepared to accept a dump for the nuclear waste from past and future schemes – rejected the proposal in January. No one should commission a mess without a plan for clearing it up. But this, above all, is a wasted opportunity. By the time a European pressurised reactor at Hinkley Point is halfway through its operating life, it will look about as hip as a traction engine. I understand that, with a project this big and timeframes this long, the government needs to pick a technology, but you would expect it to try to pick a winner. The clunky third-generation power station chosen for Hinkley C already looks outdated, beside the promise of integral fast reactors and liquid fluoride thorium reactors. While other power stations are consuming nuclear waste, Hinkley will be producing it. An estimate endorsed by the chief scientific adviser at the government's Energy Department suggests that, if integral fast reactors were deployed, the UK's stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low-carbon energy to meet all UK demand for 500 years. These reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained: solving three huge problems – energy supply, nuclear waste and climate change – at once. Thorium reactors use an element that's already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries. They recycle their own waste, leaving almost nothing behind. To build a plant at Hinkley Point which will still require uranium mining and still produce nuclear waste in 2063 is to commit to 20th-century technologies through most of the 21st. In 2011, GE Hitachi offered to build a fast reactor to start generating electricity from waste plutonium and (unlike the Hinkley developers) to carry the cost if the project failed. I phoned the government on Monday morning to ask what happened to this proposal. I'm still waiting for an answer. That global race the prime minister keeps talking about? He plainly intends to lose. • This article was amended on 29 October 2013 to clarify that if 'every square metre of roof and suitable wall in the UK were covered with solar panels, they would produce 9% of the energy currently provided by fossil fuels' is a reference to south facing roofs of domestic homes.

Now we know what the regime had in mind. The official North Korean news agency, KCNA, has claimed the country's scientists had successfully tested \"a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force\". The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO), which monitored the seismic shocks from the test, said it had indeed made a bigger bang that in 2006, and the Russian defence ministry believes the yield was over seven kilotons, above the top end of the estimates for the last test. For the sake of comparison, the Hiroshima bomb was estimated to have a yield of 13-18 kilotons and each of the permitted eight W88 warheads on a Trident II missile is 475 kilotons. However, the relatively small yield on the North Korea test is not necessarily a sign the test fizzled. If Pyongyang's claims are true, the regime has mastered the art of making a viable warhead that can sit atop of the medium- and long-range missiles it is developing. In that case, North Korea has made the last major technological leap to becoming a nuclear weapons power. Until now, it could only gets its rudimentary warheads to their targets by boat or lorry. Miniaturisation gives it a far more fearsome and immediate means of delivering a bomb. Seen from Pyongyang, this means the country has achieved under Kim Jong-un's young reign what eluded his father, a credible deterrent to safeguard the regime's survival. Seen from the region, the move will be profoundly destabilising, accelerating Japanese and South Korean efforts to build missile defences. That in turn will concern China, which is likely to see such defences as blunting the effectiveness of its own deterrence. It could consider increasing the size of its own relatively modest nuclear arsenal. The neighbouring states, the US and CTBTO will now be trying to \"sniff\" the air for any radioactive contamination. The big question will be whether the warhead tested was made of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium (HEU). The country is only thought to have produced enough plutonium to make a handful of bombs, one or two of which it had to use for testing, and its production facilities are in poor repair. However, in 2010, the regime surprised the world by showing an American academic, Siegfried Hecker, a tour of what appeared to be sophisticated uranium enrichment plant. The ability to make weapons-grade HEU gives Pyongyang the ability to build a much more substantial arsenal. HEU is not as convenient as plutonium for making warheads. You can't make them as small. But as Hecker wrote in a recent Foreign Policy article, the Pakistani nuclear smuggler, AQ Khan, is thought to have taught the North Koreans how to do the job adequately with HEU. If the new warhead is small and made of HEU, the North Korean headache just got exponentially bigger. In Chuck Hagel's Senate confirmation hearings the questions focused somewhat obsessively on Iran and Israel, as if North Korea was a contained threat. If that assumption was ever true, it is no longer after today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/2014/sep/18/2050-world-energy-calculator-carbon-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-18T09:06:45Z","webTitle":"My 2050 world: how would you cut carbon while meeting energy demand?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/2014/sep/18/2050-world-energy-calculator-carbon-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/2014/sep/18/2050-world-energy-calculator-carbon-demand","fields":{"headline":"My 2050 world: how would you cut carbon while meeting energy demand?","bodyText":"The UK government has created a digital game, My2050, which allows anyone to try their hand at meeting tough carbon reduction targets while finding enough energy to power our economy in the years ahead. From increasing solar power and cutting coal, to asking your citizens to simply turn down the central heating, what choices would you make for a sustainable future if you were in power? We asked four Guardian journalists to put the tool to the test. Louise Tickle, social affairs journalist Louise chose: • 200,000 onshore wind turbines • Decrease in average house temperature to 17 degrees • Manufacturing a third smaller than today Oooh, it’s fiddly, this balancing demand with supply while getting down to 20% of current carbon emissions. Ramping up solar, wind, marine and hydro sources to their max was my starting point, scattering turbines gaily across land and sea. No biofuels: I don’t believe in burning food. Then I started on slashing the demand. It’s surprising how little results you get for a lot of effort in some areas: insulating virtually every house only seemed to elicit a 1% cut in carbon emissions, so didn’t seem worth the money you’d have to invest to achieve it. Instead, I chose the lowest level of effort and left all the UK’s uninsulated building stock radiating heat while I looked for another sector where the gain might be more worthy of the pain. I found it in “business greenness”. Here, going from zero to hero meant a 5% reduction in carbon. I reckoned that big business could afford it, and small businesses could be subsidised by central government to green themselves. Decision made. Changing the type of heating fuel used also made a big difference to carbon emissions, so I pushed the slider to the max. This means 90% of heating is provided by electricity by 2015. Though my emissions were gradually approaching the 20% target, I was still using more energy than I was generating. Changing how we travelled wasn’t helping much: upping the number of journeys taken on public transport didn’t seem to make a vast difference to my total emissions, nor to my supply-side problem, all of which seemed a bit counter-intuitive. I decided to look at manufacturing to get my demand down, and dropped productivity by a third. Fine-tuning the balance was the trickiest part. I wanted all my renewables at top whack, but they simply weren’t producing enough energy. I swallowed hard and pushed the fossil fuels up one notch. But now I had too much energy for my needs. Reluctantly, I tried going a bit more hardcore on the demand side. But carbon emissions just started climbing. I couldn’t find a way of keeping at 20% and not producing too much power without losing some renewables capacity. Such is the life of an energy planner. I have more sympathy now. David Brindle, public services editor David chose: • No nuclear power in 2050 • Energy crops grown on an area twice the size of Wales • 60% of cars powered by electricity I guessed it would be difficult to get down to 20% CO2; I didn’t realise quite how difficult. If the object of this exercise is to make you appreciate just how tough are the choices facing us as individuals and communities, and as a society, it certainly succeeded in my case. My starting point was to plan only realistic changes, but that resolve went out of the window as I struggled to strike a demand/supply balance and cut CO2 below 20%. Some of the changes I have made do not look at all likely on the basis of our past behaviour as a nation and our present attitudes. For example, to achieve my plan we would have to make a huge commitment to biofuel production and switch half our homes to electric heating and 60% of our cars to electric transmission. Feeling instinctively uncomfortable about nuclear power, I was frustrated that there was no option between using none at all and using four times as much as we do now, building 13 large power stations. In the end, I elected to go for none. After all, if the Germans think they should and can manage without any nuclear, that’s good enough for me. Jane Dudman, editor, Guardian public leaders network Jane chose: • “Stellar” improvements in industry greenness • 8,000 onshore wind turbines • 80% of cars powered by electricity This year, I’ve been cycling in both Jordan and Scotland, contrasting experiences that have brought home the importance of using the most readily available energy resources like solar power and water. So it’s an easy decision to opt for more geothermal and hydroelectric power and more biomass fuel. But other decisions are harder. Wind turbines have become hugely divisive. And what about nuclear power? It’s clear that trying to balance our energy sources is complex and that ordinary people probably don’t yet have enough information. I’d like to know more about how DECC decided the figures for its energy calculator. I rapidly realised I don’t know enough about the efficiency compared to costs of wind turbines, nuclear or other energy sources. Having a go at this makes a good case for greater transparency and better communication about our country’s energy. Without that at our fingertips, we might – as I did – reluctanctly opt for more nuclear power because of the lack of a real alternative. As for turning down demand, let’s get people out of their cars and on to public transport – and on to their bikes, too. But getting people to do that will require much smarter, reliable and above all integrated public transport systems. We’ve all got used to warmer homes, but most of our houses are still leaking energy out of every orifice. We’ll need more input from government to help us insulate our homes. Changing shopping habits is harder. My mother used to shop every day for fresh food; no need for a huge, energy-consuming fridge-freezer. That’s not practical for families where everyone’s busy all week unless we have better-stocked and later opening local stores. But there are signs that more of us are shifting from driving to huge out-of-town stores and towards picking up supper from a railway station on the way home. David Walker, contributing editor David chose: • 50 large new nuclear power stations • All cars are electric or run on hydrogen • Large decrease in average room temperature to 16 degrees Before I set the calculator, I had been writing for other purposes about Swaffham in Norfolk. One of Swaffham’s two wind turbines has been turning for 15 years, the 66-metre diameter blades appearing and disappearing from view as you approach the town from the north. I think they make a fine sight, as does the huge London array off the Kent coast – for the sake of its serried ranks of turbines, well worth bagging a right-hand side window seat on any flight coming in from the east. So, carbon calculus aside, I suppose I approached this (like any discussion about energy futures) with a sort of aesthetic bias that extends to my appreciation of the slabs and rectangles and containment vessels of your typical nuclear plant. This doubtlessly convicts me of cultural abnormality. The exercise was valuable in forcing confrontation with demand as well as supply. The latter is easier to navigate. Selecting options on supply was straightforward enough. Nuclear generation is expensive: the “strike price” agreed by the Cameron government with EDF for Hinkley Point is high and will be carried on household bills for long years ahead. But nuclear technology is proven and associated risks are calculable and finite. Thinking about how to deal with nuclear waste forces us to contemplate generations and centuries – and that’s a valuable exercise when companies and ministers fixate on the short run. Much of today’s rural land use is industrial, so growing biomass would not necessarily alter the shape or feel of the countryside; another box ticked. So much for supply. Addressing demand was much more difficult. Public transport vs car use: that’s easy. Personally, to my partner’s chagrin, I would always turn down the thermostat and put on a jumper. But what about the older couple next door? Or the low-income family who can’t afford either better insulation or the higher energy prices that are a necessary part of tackling climate change? Demand reduction foregrounds questions of income and wealth distribution and affordability. Take the option on the 2050 calculator to cut back manufacturing: that’s not good news for the UK’s balance of payments, or jobs and income. Just as in recent times aggregate economic growth has not resulted in gains for many households, so restraint on growth could further increase inequality and favour those who already have. Cutting carbon never was, nor ever could, be just about assessing energy consumption or modes of generation and scaling back. The energy challenge can’t help but be about how we share things – and the role of government in enforcing a fair distribution of resources. Want to share your own 2050 world?

Austria has already promised to fight the decision in the courts but Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, said he might stand as an “interested party” in the European court of justice to block the planned subsidy scheme for the £24bn project in Somerset. “This is a mad decision by Brussels and a patriotic issue for us. The financial support agreed for Hinkley would be an enormous burden for the country and there is the costs of decommissioning on top of that. Where is the money going to come from?” said Vince, whose company builds windfarms as well as supplying gas and electricity. Jeremy Leggett, who founded Solarcentury, also voiced his dismay. “The days when the nuclear industry could impose whatever tilted playing field it wanted on renewables are gone,” he said. “They are dealing with huge global industries now that last year put more generation capacity online globally than all fossil fuels and nuclear combined. These are not likely to soak up nuclear nonsense without a fight any more.” Ecotricity builds windfarms and Solacentury installs solar panels. Both are worried that the government has capped the amount of money being made available for low-carbon generators. They fear that nuclear will suck up most of the available money. Paul Dorfman, a senior research associate at the Energy Institute at University College, London, said there was a groundswell of opinion among renewable energy companies and associations in Britain and Europe that something should be done: “We are profoundly disappointed that the outgoing European commission administration has decided to rush through this decision to approve state aid to Hinkley Point C without giving the new commission the opportunity to review and reflect on a decision which will set a significant precedent on energy and competition policy. That this decision has been taken in undue haste only strengthens the grounds for and likely success of a legal challenge.” The commission announced last Wednesday that it was convinced by arguments from the UK government that the “contracts for difference” aid scheme was justified to encourage EDF of France to construct the new atomic plant. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has agreed that EDF will be able to obtain £92 per megawatt hour – double the current cost of energy – over a 35-year period. The money will be recovered via energy customers’ bills but the length of the contract is much more generous than anything agreed for wind or solar power. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, described the Brussels decision as an important step on the road to Britain’s first new nuclear power station and insisted it was a good deal for consumers. “While there is much work still to do before a final contract can be signed, today’s announcement is a boost to our efforts to ensure Britain has secure, affordable low carbon electricity in the 2020s,” he said. DECC argues that rising gas and carbon prices will make nuclear power a future good bet for consumers at a time when old coal and atomic stations are coming off line owing to old age or other reasons. The decision to give the green light to Hinkley surprised many, as in January the European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, who retires on 1 November, had earlier overseen a heavily critical report on the subsidy arrangements proposed by DECC. But he said he had changed his minds after making some changes to the original proposal. EDF says it can build Hinkley Point for £16bn. But the European commission says the cost by the time it is meant to become operational in 2023 is more likely to be £24bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/dec/11/harry-lawton-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-11T15:58:59Z","webTitle":"Harry Lawton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/11/harry-lawton-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/11/harry-lawton-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Harry Lawton obituary","bodyText":"As head of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) Windscale nuclear research laboratories in Cumbria from 1976 until 1987, my father, Harry Lawton, who has died aged 91, was a major figure at an important stage in the development of nuclear power in the UK. Born and educated in Barrow-in-Furness, he graduated in natural sciences from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. During the second world war he worked in the naval shipyards where, as a young scientist, he developed X-ray techniques to check the quality of welds on submarines. He returned to Cambridge in 1946 to complete a PhD in ferromagnetism, before moving into nuclear research. From the Ministry of Supply he was transferred to the UKAEA when it was set up in 1954, and in 1961 became the deputy head of the research laboratories at Windscale. He had three years from 1963 to 1966 at the Dounreay nuclear site in Caithness, as assistant director responsible for advancing the technology of fast reactor fuel, before being promoted to head the labs at Windscale. Harry was of the view that a well-managed nuclear power programme had the potential to bring about a more equal distribution of energy across the world; and that this in turn would lead to more stability and fewer wars, particularly over oil. Former colleagues have described how he combined an outstanding intellect with great technical insight and a gift for leadership, inspiring a generation of scientists and engineers. \"Walking the floor\" was part of his style, talking to staff at all levels, discussing research in areas covering engineering, physics, chemistry and mathematics, getting to know the 500 staff and keeping in touch with many after retirement. Harry recognised at an early stage that decommissioning was a vital part of the overall nuclear programme. He went on to lead the pioneering research programme to decommission the Windscale reactor. His period in charge at Windscale was one of exciting technical development which he fostered with pride and great ability. He also played an active part in the local community, chairing the governors of Wyndham comprehensive school in Egremont (now the West Lakes Academy) for many years, using his influence to drive up the standards of education in west Cumbria. He had a fine sense of humour and loved words, correcting everyone's grammar; he was once seen reading a copy of Sir Ernest Gowers's Complete Plain Words in the stands at Brunton Park during half-time while watching Carlisle United. He always read the Guardian and enjoyed Araucaria's crosswords. Dorothy, Harry's wife of more than 60 years, died in June. They are survived by their five children, Mary, Philip, the twins Michael and Nancy, and me; and 10 grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-24T14:21:53Z","webTitle":"The nine green policies killed off by the Tory government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government","fields":{"headline":"The nine green policies killed off by the Tory government","bodyText":"Amber Rudd has been accused of “grotesque hypocrisy” today for claiming the government is leading on climate change while overseeing a string of attacks on green policies. Some environmentalists say it’s the worst period for environmental policy in three decades. We’ve rounded up the green measures that have been axed or find themselves in the firing line, to show the breadth and scale of the changes. Scrapping support for onshore wind Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary said she was halting new subsidies to onshore wind farms on the grounds that the technology should stand on its own feet and save bill payers money. In fact the writing had been on the wall for onshore wind farms since February 2012 when 101 backbench Conservative party MPs wrote to David Cameron demanding “dramatic cuts” in subsidies. A moratorium on more onshore wind was rejected by the Tories’ coalition partners, particularly the Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey. But the Conservatives went into the election promising to “halt the spread of onshore wind farms”. Ironically onshore wind has attracted a lot of investment and can be the most cost-efficient way of producing low carbon energy. Solar subsidies to be axed too Ministers have targeted larger solar installations of less than five megawatts – enough to power 2,500 homes – in a consultation on the early closure of the renewable obligation (RO) subsidy aimed at April 2016. But the government also announced a review of another subsidy, the feed-in tariff, to make further significant savings in a move that could threaten state support for solar panels on domestic roof tops. The solar power sector has grown dramatically over the past 18 months, leading ministers to panic about a forthcoming potential budget overspend on support schemes of £1.5bn by 2020. It later admitted the benefit of scrapping support for this nascent industry at this stage would only save energy consumers 50p a year. Biomass hit too The government also confirmed this week that it was removing the guaranteed level of RO subsidy for coal or other fossil fuelled-power stations which are converting to wood or another biomass fuel. Killing the flagship green homes scheme On Thursday, the government effectively killed off the green deal, its “transformational” way of helping homeowners bring down their energy bills through installing insulation, and fitting new boilers and draught-proofing. Few will mourn the scheme, which provided loans to homeowners to fund the measures – but as the Guardian reported many times, take-up was very low. But what’s striking is Rudd has nothing to replace it with. So, apart from poorer households, who get support through the separate ECO scheme, there is now no serious energy efficiency policy for homes, which account for around a third of UK carbon emissions. A review of all remaining energy efficiency schemes is currently underway with details expected in the autumn budget. Selling off the green investment bank Launched in 2012 to help green projects with an initial injection of £3.8bn of public money, the green investment bank is probably the example cited most often by George Osborne and David Cameron in their defence of the government’s environmental record. But last month the business secretary, Sajid Javid, said he would be selling off as much as 70% of the bank. Whether that harms the energy efficiency, waste and offshore wind power projects that the bank invests in remains to be seen. But even the influential Tory thinktank Bright Blue was unimpressed by the move, saying it was the “last thing we need”. Watering down the incentive to buy a greener car The summer budget ripped up the current system of taxation for new cars (vehicle excise duty, often erroneously referred to as road tax). Anyone who currently buys a new car pays a different rate for the first year based on how polluting the car is, a system which continues every year thereafter, ranging from free for electric cars to £505 for the dirtiest. But from 2017, after the first year, all cars will pay the same £140 annual fee, so a Porsche will be taxed the same as a Prius. The car industry says the change takes away the incentive to buy a low-emissions car, while Friends of the Earth says a greener car will now cost £1,000 more over seven years. Giving up on zero carbon homes A decade-long plan to force all new homes to be ‘zero carbon’ from 2016 was binned by the Treasury earlier this month, prompting the former Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey to say David Cameron “may as well hug a coal power station”. Major housing developers said the decision was “extremely disappointing”, a view that was echoed by planners, green groups and the designer of a new ‘carbon positive’ house that just opened in Wales. Fracking in Britain’s most important nature sites Rudd said in January that fracking wouldn’t be allowed in sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs). Last week she changed her mind, opening the door to fracking in thousands of SSSIs in England, Wales and Scotland, if the shale companies can get past planners. Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said the u-turn was outrageous. Goodbye green tax target A target set during the last government to keep increasing the proportion of revenue from environmental taxes was dropped in Osborne’s emergency budget. Tidal power in the firing line? There has already been speculation that one talismanic project, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, currently awaiting a subsidy offer from the Treasury, could be being lined up for the chop. This £1bn scheme is expensive but was name-checked positively by chancellor George Osborne in the spring budget. Its supporters have always argued it would trigger a whole new industry that could lead to 30 similar projects starting around an island country perfectly suited for this low carbon technology. What’s left – and safe? Nuclear power certainly. The government – like its predecessors of all political stripes seem mesmerised by atomic power and are willing to provide extremely generous financial support and other help to kickstart a renaissance. Britain’s first planned new nuclear plant for over 25 years at Hinkley Point in Somerset is backed by government but faces all sorts of other hurdles such as uncertain equity investors, legal challenges and ever-increasing costs and delays, which could scupper it yet. Offshore wind, much more expensive than onshore farms, has so far escaped the axe although there are plenty of Tory critics willing to decry the cost and claim it is a blot on the seascape. How long will this pioneering industry survive unscathed?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2014/dec/09/guardian-weekly-letters-12-december-2014","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-09T13:59:04Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 12 December 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/09/guardian-weekly-letters-12-december-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2014/dec/09/guardian-weekly-letters-12-december-2014","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 12 December 2014","bodyText":"End our nuclear love affair In your article US and China strike deal on carbon cuts (21 November), we read, “It will require China to deploy an additional 800-1000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero-emission generation capacity by 2030 – more than all the coal power plants that exist in China today”. There will be similar cuts for the US. While the general population is largely asleep about the dangers of decommissioning a nuclear power station, we are told only of the danger of reaching an increase of 2C in global temperature. Nothing we know of will dissipate the radioactivity from closed nuclear power stations. Meanwhile, climate temperatures for the future depend on computer predictions, based on particular assumptions about past increases, with carbon as the only possible cause. The way forward is to increase ecological sources of energy, using the money dedicated by the present UK government’s deals for restarting the nuclear power industry. Our goal should be a significant decrease in energy use. As we wean ourselves from energy-intensive computers and other gadgets, we will create a more natural lifestyle, which will solve many of our present human problems. The end of the UK’s love affair with Trident and nuclear defence would also release vast sums of money for a better future, including a reduction in the national debt. Can’t we learn from the years of “cleaning up the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant” that still continue (21 November)? Brian Dawes Montrose, UK Enough is enough I read with some dismay Will Hutton’s rabidly expansionist article (5 December) on the growth potential inherent in the collapse in the world oil price. Even if we ignore the widespread economic and social damage caused by the US fracking revolution, to hear him echoing the blinkered view of the majority of those attending the recent G20 that we must, first and foremost, promote economic growth, gives me little hope for any answer to the world’s most pressing problems: climate change and inequality. As George Monbiot has noted: “Economic growth is an artefact of the use of fossil fuels” (28 May). Economic expansion has almost always been achieved at the cost of the profligate use of highly polluting fossil-fuel reserves, accompanied by a widening rift between the haves and the have-nots. Our choices are not simply between stagnation and rapid, unrestrained economic expansion. There is a middle road, albeit one that will require restraint. The concept of a steady-state economy has been developed since the 1970s by such forward-thinking economists as E F Shumacher and Herman Daly, and has come to the attention of the current generation of economists and planners with the pioneering work of Rob Dietz and Dan O’Neill. Any exhortation to exploit the recent fall in the crude oil price to pursue the unsustainable path of more of the same is irresponsible. We can hope that Hutton’s piece does at least encourage further discussion on what constitute the real values and attainable goals of a sharing culture. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia This cold war is no surprise Thanks to Simon Tisdall for his analysis of the new cold war (28 November). The auguries of this second cold war should have been apparent almost immediately after the end of the first. Vladimir Putin is quite right when he points to the continued existence of Nato as the main cause of tension. Nato has been redundant since 1991. Those who had vested interests in its continued existence should have been confronted with this fact. It made impossible the extension of a rapprochement that seemed to be growing before Mikhail Gorbachev’s departure. The alliance that replaced the Warsaw Pact was not created until 1992. The failure to grasp the opportunity of making Nato redundant is one that the world will regret. Peter David Rees Lesmahagow, UK Burkeman got it wrong I am sorry, but Oliver Burkeman has got it wrong this time (November 28). After a neat introduction to Dunbar’s number, he makes the assumption that social networks are networks between equal friends. They are not, and thus his conclusion that “densely linked friends are better friends” is erroneous. The internet’s social networks should be renamed in popular jargon for what they mostly are: me networks. Most postings are examples of a person who is so alone that he or she believes that the words or video he or she offers are of interest to the world. “Listen to me”, the person screams. Naturally, there can be very small social networks, two to eight persons at most, who find it more convenient to chat online than to write a letter. They have to live with the fact that their social chit-chatting is open to a vast range of people, some of whom will try to take advantage of whatever is said or shown. This vast range doesn’t constitute a social network: it’s merely an audience. You might wonder where the number eight comes from as the upper limit of a group of interactive friends. It is the approximate number of people in a committee who can come to a decision, according to Parkinson’s law of triviality. Any more and the committee will split into subcommittees to do any work. I suspect that number works for the internet too. Dunbar’s number of 150 is merely the larger pool from which groupings of eight can be chosen for any particular subject. That said, Burkeman’s column is always worth reading. It makes you think. John Graham Hoogstraten, Belgium Our leaders are very selfish In Owen Jones’s article Inequality is not a human instinct (28 November), the researchers quoted are probably right in claiming that normal human beings are not dog-eat-dog selfish. However, I am not convinced that the same holds true of our leadership, who appear to rate strongly on checklists devised to identify the minority of individuals with narcissistic psychopathy. In all walks of life, whether self-appointed or elected, we find leaders who have superficial charm, a grandiose sense of self-worth, a lack of remorse, a shallow affect, a callous lack of empathy, who are cunning, manipulative, irresponsible, and pathologically untruthful. These traits almost come with the job, and the rest of us feel out of place among such people. Surely, with such people in charge, we are not likely to achieve a more just and equal world. Bernard Galton St-Nazaire-sur-Charente, France Kosovo is no success story It seems awfully strange to expect the failed state of Kosovo to function properly and thrive when it was constructed on illegal foundations after Nato’s savage war on the Serbian people (14 November). Whether or not the Hague war crimes tribunal agrees, many of Kosovo’s leaders operate without any understanding of law and order; rather, they use their advantage in society for personal benefit instead of serving the citizens who elected them – and kowtow to wealthy western businesses. If Kosovo is considered a “success” of western policy in the Balkans, I shudder to imagine what a failure would comprise. Michael Pravica Henderson, Nevada, US Briefly • Philip Ball writes that science has “an obligation to cultivate healthy systems for making ... forecasts” of processes such as weather, climate and earthquakes (21 November). Peer-reviewed science does a good job of quantifying probabilities. It is journalists who frequently fall short in their obligation to report scientific predictions correctly. David Cotter Woodbridge, UK • To suggest as Paul Mason does, that anti-war images designed to influence public opinion date back to 1924 – “a precise moment in history” – is misleading. His otherwise timely article (28 November) overlooks the efforts of earlier artists whose repugnance at the atrocities of war led them to produce horrific images. Who cannot be moved, for example, by Francisco Goya’s horrific 19th-century series of prints depicting battlefield mutilationsr? Mason’s premise that graphic records of war’s savagery have never deterred humankind is greatly strengthened by similar records made centuries before the dawn of photography. Jack Benlow Heathfield, South Australia • As research into the benefits of nostalgia continues apace (28 November), I add this bit from biologist Edward O Wilson’s chapter on Free Will from his new book The Meaning of Human Existence: “we summon stories of past events for contrast and meaning”. Our “human necessity” for what Wilson calls “confabulation” helps us to make decisions based on “multiple competing scenarios”. Thus, “Memories of past episodes are repeated [not only] for pleasure”, as confirmed in your article, but also “for rehearsal, for planning, or for various combinations of all three”. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada • It was not only the lads who were delivering the mail at Christmas (28 November). As an impecunious student at LSE in the 40s, I remember finding the sorting room of the Royal Mail a bit boring. The professional postmen, with whom I would chat in their van, were very matey and amused by my company; when I told them my lecture hours they thought I could easily combine a student’s life with a full-time postman’s job.

The invitation came in May’s first conversation with the president-elect. Trump reportedly spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to May, but Number 10 sources have said there was no urgent need for a conversation. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has announced plans to strengthen links between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. He was speaking at a press conference with the Chinese vice premier, Ma Kai. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has denounced Trump as a “a racist, misogynistic self-confessed groper” but also set out three lessons progressive parties can learn from his election victory. (See 2.33pm.) That’s all from me for today. I have to get to a school parents’ “evening” - which is late afternoon. Thanks for the comments. This is from the Sun’s Harry Cole. This is from the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy. Theresa May has spoken to Donald Trump. This is from ITV’s Chris Ship. It is worth noting that of the three lessons that Ed Miliband thinks progressives need to learn from Donald Trump (see 2.33pm), two are ones that Jeremy Corbyn has already embraced. Corbyn’s policy agenda is ambitious, not incremental, and he can credibly pose as an outsider. But he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, was on the World at One talking about Donald Trump. He expressed horror at Trump’s politics but, like Jeremy Corbyn yesterday, and Emily Thornberry this morning, he accepted that Trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status quo. Miliband said that he thought he had a “good analysis” of this problem when he was leader of the Labour party but that his solutions were obviously “not sufficiently convincing” (because he lost the general election). However since then Miliband appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges. It was one of the most interesting interventions I’ve heard from any British politician since Trump’s election. Here are the key points. Miliband identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of Donald Trump. Parties like Labour needed to offer big solutions, stop defending the system like insiders and embrace patriotism, he said. I think there are deep lessons [from Brexit and Trump]. What are the lessons? First of all the economic lessons, because whatever you say about Trump and Brexit, they offer big solutions. I think they are false solutions, and we should not invent false gods of our own. But our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we see. Secondly, being political insiders is a massive problem. Trump was the consumate outsider and I do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard. And I think we have to think very hard about how we don’t defend the existing, broken politics that people perceive, but actually want to change it. Then, thirdly, this issue of nationhood and patriotism. And the truth is that Trump has invented a xenophobic, anti-immigrant, nasty view of nationhood, but we don’t yet have a convincing one of our own. Simply defending globalisation, openness on its own, without fairness, has been proved to be deeply insufficient. He said neoliberalism had failed. We should certainly be saying neoliberalism has failed ... The current economic system does not work. It has accrued the gains to the top 1% and people have got squeezed and left out. He said that, following the Brexit vote, he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of EU citizens into the UK. Politicians had to understand people’s concerns, he said. Having seen the referendum we have got, if at all possible, to see some change in relation to free movement. He said that he still believed in openness, and the advantages of the single market, but that this needed to be combined with fairness too. He described Trump as “a racist, misogynistic self-confessed groper” and said people should be “deeply worried” about his election. The idea that we have shared values with a racist, misogynistic self-confessed groper beggars belief. I think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care about: tackling climate change, he says it’s invented by the Chinese and it’s a hoax; dealing with problems in the Middle East, he says he’s going to recognise Jerusalem almost immediately [as the capital of Israel] with all kinds of implications that has for the Middle East peace process; his attitude to Russia. And then this fantasy about trade. This guy is anti trade; he’s an odd combination of protectionism plus the old trickle-down tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first place. He said Trump’s election was symptomatic of a “sickness” in America. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has suggested that Donald Trump’s protectionsim could damage global prosperity. (See 10.42am.) Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has said some of Trump’s views are “deeply abhorrent”. (See 1.28pm.) The UK’s hopes for a continuation of the much-vaunted special relationship with the US under Trump have suffered an early setback after the new president-elect spoke to nine world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without Theresa May getting a call. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary has compared the wave of popular support for Trump’s anti-establishment message to the similarly unexpected rise ofJeremy Corbyn, energised for similar reasons. Theresa May said Britain’s relationship with China remains “golden” as she opened talks aimed at bringing billions of Chinese investment to the north of England. The number of patients in England who were medically fit to leave hospital but unable to be safely discharged has reached a new high for the sixth month in a row, increasing pressure on the government to tackle the social care shortage. Liz Truss, the lord chancellor, has said she takes her oath to defend the judiciary seriously but will not criticise the press for the reporting of the high court Brexit case, in which three judges were called “enemies of the people”. Nicola Sturgeon has warned that legitimate concerns about economic alienation must never be allowed to give a veneer of respect to racism, misogyny and intolerance, in a strongly worded response to the election of Donald Trump. Addressing the Holyrood chamber at FMQs, Sturgeon went further than her initial statement on Trump’s shock victory yesterday – in which she urged the president elect to prove that he can act for all US citizens regardless of race or background – declaring: “I’m not prepared to be a politician that maintains a diplomatic silence in the face of racism, misogyny or hatred of any kind.” Describing some of the views expressed by Trump during his campaign as “deeply abhorrent”, she said that there was more of an obligation than ever “for people of progressive opinion the world over to stand up and be counted”. She added: There is no doubt whatsoever that many people feel economically alienated, but we must never allow those legitimate concerns to give a veneer of respectability to racism, misogyny and intolerance. Responding to a series of questions from Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who herself travelled to the United States last week to campaign for Hillary Clinton, she said that the Democratic candidate’s defeat ‘tells us we are not as far down road to gender equality as we hoped we were’. Dugdale warned that Donald Trump’s behaviour towards women sent “a dangerous signal across the world”. But Sturgeon also insisted that, whilst she regretted the result, she respected the decision of the American people and wanted to engage “positively and constructively” with the next US administration. Sturgeon has previously stripped Trump of his honorary role as a Scottish business ambassador last year, after his attack on Mexicans and Muslims, describing his rhetoric as “obnoxious and offensive”. It has been a bumper autumn for political publishing. I am still ploughing through the EU referendum books, but here are three memoirs that have landed on my desk in recent weeks that are worth reading. Speaking Out by Ed Balls: This is Ed Balls’ memoir of his time in politics. It is not an account of everything he did, and anyone hoping for an insider account of the Blair/Brown rivalry will be disappointed. Instead it is structured thematically and all the chapters focus on lessons learnt from his time as an adviser and a minister. Occasionally the anecdotes are a bit cheesy, but the book is exceptionally readable and anyone interested in learning about the craft of politics will find it riveting. Surprisingly, with his strong plea for a politics combining social justice with faith in the markets, Balls also emerges from the book sounding like the very last survivor of New Labour. Sample extracts: One of the important lessons I’ve learnt in politics over two decades is that it’s not only common for people to hold two seemingly contradictory opinions at the same time, but it also makes a good deal of sense. So when I think of the conversations I’ve had with voters in recent years, I recall people ranting about the bankers and what they had done to the economy and how angry they were about it. But when asked, the same people would agree that banks are important for our economy and just want them to work better in the future, not to be permanently weakened. They know they matter for their savings and mortgages, and for small-business lending, and more widely for jobs and wealth creation in the economy. From before 1997, it was my job to organise the annual Christmas party for Gordon [Brown] and his inner circle of political advisers in a Westminster restaurant or later in the Downing Street flat, sometimes the only time in the whole year where he’d stop and thank all of us collectively for the punishing and occasionally painful hours we put in. As well as dinner and secret santa, and the handing out of presents from Gordon and Sarah, and from Sue Nye - usually lurid but fashionable ties - there were also certain customs that became established over the years, most sacred of all the singing of ‘Jerusalem’ (twice) complete with the elaborate acting-out of the lyrics - shooting arrows, wielding spears, and so on. If that sounds awful, it at least served as the best possible induction into the team for relative newcomers. Hinterland by Chris Mullin: Mullin has already written three superb volumes of diaries covering his life as a Labour minister and an MP, and this is an autobiography that fills in the gaps, mostly focusing on his career as a writer and campaigner before he entered parliament. Andy Beckett was probably right in his Guardian review when he said this was too incidental to Mullin’s other writing to be a classic political memoir, but Mullin is such a good observer that he could make even a dull life seem interesting, and his has been anything but. I enjoyed it very much. Sample extract: What have I learnt in my (almost) seventy years on this planet? That life is short and one should make the most of it (although I expect most people my age have reached the same conclusion). That it is stupid to waste time on feuds and vendettas. That happiness comes from doing stuff, not buying stuff, and that the greatest happiness comes from helping others. That in any walk of life it is better to go while people are asking ‘Why?’ rather than ‘When?’ That the art of good government (and the key to success in many other professions) is an ability to compromise, though not necessarily at the lowest common denominator. That no religion, ideology or political party has a monopoly of wisdom. That anyone who claims to have discovered a perfect formula for human happiness is deluded. That although there are admirable people in all walks of life, put not thy faith in heroes; they often have feet of clay. That one should never overlook the possibility, however remote, that one is mistaken; or that one’s critics - or political opponents - are right. That, as I have learnt from the experience of my wife and her family in Vietnam, state control of the means of production, distribution and exchange does not result in greater happiness. And neither does rule by corporations. In short, big is not necessarily beautiful. Our best bet is the regulated market. That taxation, fairly raised and efficiently used, is the subscription we pay to live in civilisation. That an economy built on shopping does not have long to live. That the human race must adapt to survive: if human beings continue to use the resources of the planet as if there is no tomorrow, then there will be no tomorrow. That the great strength of capitalism is its ability to adapt to changed circumstances: its greatest (and potentially fatal) weakness is its voracious appetite for resources. One way or another the future is green ... or black. Politics: Between the Extremes by Nick Clegg: This is in part a book about Clegg’s time as the Lib Dem deputy prime minister in the coalition, but it does not set out to be a full account of that government and Clegg’s main aim is to defend liberalism and explain how the politics of reason can survive and flourish in the age of Brexit/Trump-style populism. It would be wrong to pretend he has all the answers, but his book is well-written, clear-headed, refreshingly free of self-pity and upbeat. In fact, very upbeat. Clegg suggests he has not given up hope of the Lib Dems returning to power in a national government - or even of Brexit being reversed. Sample extract: If that were to happen [Brexit leading to economic turmoil] the political consequences would be brutal. The millions of British voters who were lured by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and others to vote for a sunny Brexit future will be enraged that their personal economic well-being has been damaged, and will demand different leadership in Westminster and possibly even a rethink of the decision to quit the EU in the first place ... For a start, there should be an early general election, once Theresa May has published a full, detailed plan for the Brexit negotiations, so that voters are given an opportunity to express their approval, or otherwise, of what life outside the EU may actually look like. If the British people decide that they do not wish to grant the Conservative party a majority in that election, it will be up to other parties to try to form a government - possibly a government of national unity - whose sole purpose will be to steer the country through this unprecedented period of constitutional and economic turmoil by striking a better deal for Britain with the EU. Nigel Farage has claimed to be “the catalyst” for the rise of Donald Trump, referred to Barack Obama as a “creature”, and joked about Trump’s alleged sexual assaults on women, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has launched a very strong attack on Donald Trump in the Scottish parliament this afternoon. My colleague Libby Brooks will be filing more on this soon, but this is what she has tweeted. The women working for the Green party earn on average 1.45% more than the men. To mark equal pay day, the party has published its own gender pay gap figure. It is considerably better than the national average, which sees women earning on average 18.1% less than men. The party has 42 people working for it, either full-time or part-time. Sarah Cope, the Greens’ spokesperson for women, said: From this day until the end of the year women in the UK are effectively working for free because of the ongoing and unacceptable gap in pay between men and women. It is up to political parties to lead by example. That’s why today the Green Party are releasing figures to show our gender pay ratio, making the pay that we give to men and women open for all. We call on other political parties to do the same and ensure that they are doing what they can to end the unequal treatment of women in work. Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, has told Radio 5 Live that Donald Trump is a racist. Suzanne Evans, the former Ukip deputy chairman and a candidate in the leadership contest, has announced that she has withdrawn her application to be Ukip’s candidate in the Sleaford and North Hykeham byelection. In a Facebook post she says she is doing this because she has been told that, if she were selected as the byelection candidate, she would have to withdraw from the leadership contest. The byelection is being held on Thursday 8 December. It was triggered by the resignation of the Conservative MP Stephen Phillips. Ukip’s chances of winning in Sleaford are slight. The party came third in the seat in the general election, and Phillips had a majority of more than 24,000. Ukip’s trade spokesman, William Dartmouth MEP, is calling for Nigel Farage to be made the next ambassador to Washington. Farage, the outgoing Ukip leader, spoke at a Trump rally during the election campaign and has a cordial relationship with the president-elect. Dartmouth said: Nigel Farage already has good ties and a relationship with the US President-elect Donald Trump - much better than any one else in British public life. His appointment would materially assist the UK in getting a UK-USA trade agreement for the first time. We in the UK would then be “at the front of the queue”. Nigel Farage’s appointment is clearly in the national interest. The alternative is some establishment Foreign Office “high flyer” with neither empathy nor understanding for the next US president and administration. Nigel Farage is the best choice for UK ambassador in Washington and the only rational one. The UK’s national interest should come first. Farage himself has joked about wanting to be Trump’s ambassador to the EU. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has given a brief interview to the BBC this morning about Donald Trump. He said that he was sure that Britain would have “a very constructive dialogue with the new American administration”. But he also signalled that he did not support Trump’s protectionist policies. Asked if he agreed with Trump’s plans to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 45%, he replied: Britain has always believed that the best way long-term to protect jobs and promote prosperity is free markets and free trade. And, when asked if he thought free trade deals needed to be fundamentally rethought, as Trump suggests, he suggested he didn’t. He replied: We believe that free trade and open markets are good for prosperity, good for the protection of jobs in this economy. But we do also recognise the concerns that there are around dumping and unfair practices, and it’s about getting the right balance in the global trading system so that we can have the benefits of open markets, while being properly and appropriately protected from unfair practices. This is from the BBC’s diplomatic correspondent, James Landale. The government should phase out level 2 apprenticeships for 16 to 18-year-olds, the IPPR thinktank says in report today. There are 90,000 people doing these apprenticeships and the IPPR report says they are of limited use. There is a particular problem with level 2 apprenticeships, which are not currently well designed to meet the needs of 16–18-year-olds: they are often very job specific, they do not include much off-the-job training, they only last one year, and – from next year – they will not be required to include a recognised qualification. It recommends replacing them with a pre-apprenticeship programme. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning talking about Donald Trump. She was asked about the statement that Jeremy Corbyn put out yesterday about Trump’s election and she said the vote showed that Americans recognised the need to change the system. But that did not mean she welcomed it, she said. Here are two points that stood out. Thornberry said there were “some similarities” between Trump’s supporters and Corbyn’s supporters. Asked if Trump was tapping into the same anger that led to Corbyn being elected Labour leader, she paused for what seemed quite a long time before she replied. She told the programme: Well - yes and no. I think it is right to say that there are too many people who feel that the political system doesn’t work on behalf of everyone. I think it’s right that there are hundreds of thousands of people who have now been energised in Britain by Jeremy Corbyn being leader of the Labour party. So I think that there are some similarities. But she went on: I think that it is quite clear that the values and principles that Jeremy Corbyn espouses are very different to those espoused by Trump. Thornberry suggested that Trump’s “simplistic solutions” would not work. She was asked about his policy on immigration, and she replied: I wonder what will happen in the next four or five years in the United States when you’ve had a presidential candidate who gets elected on the back of very simplistic promises, and whether he’s going to be able to put those policies into fruition and what the effect of that will be, because I suspect that it will show that simplistic solutions do not work. But she said that some of Trump’s other ideas were sound. What you need to be doing is things like investing in skills and jobs. And - to give him credit, I never thought I would hear myself say that - Donald Trump was talking about the importance of investing in jobs, investing in infrastructure, getting the economy going in all parts of the country, not just the main cities, and that’s right. AT the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue Philip Hammond will be trying to persuade Chinese investors to invest in 13 projects in what’s called the northern powerhouse investment portfolio. Collectively they are worth more than £5bn. The details are set out here, in a Treasury news release. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, says this shows the UK is open for business. Attracting trade and investment is the foundation of our strong economy, helping to create local jobs, build local businesses and contribute to our national wealth. These real-time and market-ready projects will build on the successes of the northern owerhouse region, which has for centuries been a global hub of commerce, science, technology and innovation. Setting out opportunities like these show to Chinese investors, and to the world, that the UK remains open for business. Parliament is in recess, there is very little UK politics in the diary, and most MPs are probably spending the day trying to work out what the election of Donald Trump as president means for America, for Britain and for the entire world. Their best starting point may well be the Guardian’s US elections 2016 live blog. If there is more UK reaction I will be posting it here, but otherwise I will be focusing on what is happening at Westminster and the highlight seems to be - Philip Hammond, the chancellor, holding talks with the Chinese vice premier Ma Kai in London. They are due to hold a press conference at 2.30pm. Ma also met Theresa May and Hammond last night. This is what the Press Association has filed ahead of today’s meeting. Theresa May has reaffirmed her commitment to maintaining the “golden era” in Britain’s relations with China as the government hosts talks aimed at boosting Beijing’s investment in the UK’s infrastructure. Chancellor Philip Hammond is meeting a Chinese delegation headed by vice premier Ma Kai in London for the eighth UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue as ministers seek to underline that Britain remains “open for business” following the vote for Brexit. The move will be seen as a fresh attempt to reassure the Chinese after a rocky start to relations under May. One of her first acts on becoming prime minister last July was to order a review of the project to build the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant - part-financed by the Chinese - to the intense annoyance of Beijing. But having finally given the green light to the plant last September, May has again echoed the deal’s architect, former chancellor George Osborne, in speaking of a “golden era” in Sino-UK relations. In a statement ahead of the UK-China dialogue May said: I’m determined that as we leave the European Union, we build a truly global Britain that is open for business. As we take the next step in this golden era of relations between the UK and China, I am excited about the opportunities for expanding trade and investment between our two countries. Hammond also said UK/Chinese relations were in a “golden era”. He said: The golden era in UK China relations continue to deepen. With our complementary bilateral trade ties, China and the UK remain natural partners and building on this relationship will form the cornerstone of this year’s dialogue.

The EU competition commissioner said Brussels was likely to investigate the deal, which guarantees a minimum power price for 35 years, to make sure it conformed with state aid rules. The commission frowns on national governments offering deals to companies that stifle competition and distort the market. Joaquín Almunia said: \"We are starting to analyse what is in the British proposal. Probably we will open a formal investigation because many people are asking the same question [whether the UK's agreement was too long].\" Energy secretary Ed Davey gave the go-ahead in October for a consortium led by France's EDF Energy to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Its two reactors will cost £8bn each and will provide enough power to supply 7% of Britain's homes for 60 years. Davey agreed a minimum price of £92.50 for every megawatt hour (MWh) of energy that Hinkley Point generates – almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. The deal with EDF was unprecedented and made the UK the first European country to offer a set price over 35 years for a new nuclear project. EDF laid off workers at Hinkley Point in April to cut costs when talks with the government were making slow progress. The company was said to be spending £1m a day on the project. The government has said it is confident the deal will stand up to EU scrutiny but a formal probe could take years and cast prolonged doubt over the plan. The government has said the new plant is vital to make Britain more self-sufficient and to cut use of fossil fuels. The UK notified the commission about the deal at the end of October. A decision on whether to investigate would normally be expected within two months but that time period could be extended. Almunia gave no indication of how long an investigation might take but the commission sees the government's deal with EDF, Areva and China's General Nuclear Power as complex and highly novel. An investigation is therefore likely to be in-depth to investigate all aspects of the proposals. Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said: \"I have no reason to believe the commission will block it.\" An investigation would look at whether the government's decision was proportionate and whether there were alternatives to offering guarantees to EDF. An inquiry is also likely to seek the views of other interested parties. Reports in the French press said the government in Paris was monitoring the machinations around the deal closely and was worried that delays could threaten France's nuclear industry. The government's proposals were always likely to receive attention from the commission but Almunia's comments suggest they will be subjected to intense scrutiny. The UK wants the EU to accept that nuclear power should be given special status like renewable energy but Germany and Austria oppose such a move and Hinkley Point is likely to be considered like any other state aid case. Moves by the commission to block or radically alter the nuclear deal could spark a major dispute between London and Brussels. Many Conservative MPs and constituency parties are virulently opposed to Europe's influence over UK policy and David Cameron has pledged a referendum on UK membership of the EU if the Tories win the 2015 election. The commission is revising its guidelines on state aid and aims to finalise them next year to run for the rest of this decade. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"We have always been clear that EDF will only be offered an investment contract if it is fair, affordable, value for money and consistent with state aid rules. \"The UK government continues to work closely with the commission on state aid. It would not be appropriate for the UK government to comment on an ongoing process or on the timescales for approval.\" The government's case was dealt a blow a month ago when analysts at Liberum Capital argued that the guarantees offered to EDF could prove to be \"economically insane\". They said by agreeing an inflation-linked price Davey had made a huge bet the cost of fossil fuels would rocket by the time Hinkley Point starts operating in 2023. The House of Commons' environmental audit committee has also criticised the government for refusing to admit that the Hinkley Point deal had subsidised EDF and its consortium partners. \"The government cannot escape that clear fact by talking about 'support mechanisms' and 'insurance policies' instead of 'subsidies',\" the committee said in a report. EDF declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/feb/22/birdwatch-kingfisher-somerset","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-22T21:30:08Z","webTitle":"Birdwatch: Kingfisher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/22/birdwatch-kingfisher-somerset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/feb/22/birdwatch-kingfisher-somerset","fields":{"headline":"Birdwatch: Kingfisher","bodyText":"If there’s one bird that brightens up even the dullest winter’s day, it’s the kingfisher. But you have to be quick to appreciate it: once you hear that high-pitched, metallic call, you only have a moment before a blue-and-orange flash shoots away from you and out of sight. I’ve seen a lot of kingfishers lately. Partly this is because I’m on a New Year fitness kick, so I’ve been cycling and running (well, jogging) around the lanes behind my Somerset home. Kingfishers sit unseen in the rhynes (the narrow ditches that drain water off the land) and then fly rapidly away as I approach. As always, I’m struck as much by their tiny size – barely bigger than a sparrow – as by their undeniably dazzling colours. Other birds I’m encountering on my dawn and dusk outings are rather more cooperative: the buzzard that sits tight even as I cycle past, the stonechats that pop up on top of the hedgerows and, best of all, a barn owl – the first I have seen so close to home – that hunts for voles among the hay-bales still sitting in the fields. I’ve also seen kingfishers on both my local patches: the new one on the coast, where they fly up and down the River Brue as it reaches its mouth; and my original, inland one. You’d think I’d know better by now, but I’m always surprised when I inadvertently flush the kingfisher that perches on the edge of the drain at the southern end of my inland patch. Little egrets feed here too, just below the banks, so that sometimes I can get really close to them before they notice me and fly away on their snow-white wings. Otherwise, it’s been a fairly quiet year so far, probably because it’s been such a mild winter. At the coast, I’ve been getting used to the wide-open spaces and sheer numbers of birds. On one visit a flock of at least two thousand dunlins twisted and turned in the late afternoon sun, flashing alternately dark and light as they searched for somewhere safe to roost at high tide. There have been a few surprises, too: a lone brent goose by the Huntspill Sluice; a flock of 50 or so avocets feeding on the opposite side of the river, against the incongruous backdrop of Hinkley Point nuclear power station; and a rock pipit feeding among a dozen of the commoner meadow variety. Inland, I’ve enjoyed fabulous close-up views of bearded tits, one of which has joined forces with a winter flock of blue, great and long-tailed tits. There are also goldcrests and treecreepers foraging for tiny insects in the wet wood, and a singing coal tit, whose joyous, explosive sound really did make me imagine for a moment that spring was just around the corner. But the best sighting of all was not a bird, but one of our most elusive mammals. Visiting with a friend, as we reached the drain at the southwest corner of the patch we saw the kingfisher shooting away upstream. My companion and I were just congratulating ourselves on seeing this dazzling bird, when a long, slender figure lolloped across the path: an otter. Like most otter sightings, it lasted barely two seconds before the animal disappeared into the reeds; but like all of them, it will linger long in the memory.

That's because one crucial piece of the jigsaw – the price at which government will guarantee to buy electricity from new nuclear plants – is still to appear. In practice, one can't blame Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, for deciding he's seen enough to conclude he doesn't want to take part. After the Fukushima disaster in Japan, the costs of new nuclear have risen and the construction timetable in the UK has slipped into the middle distance. Once upon a time, the first plant was meant to be operational in 2017; now it's 2020 and counting. Meanwhile, a shale gas revolution may or may not be taking place. Either way, the government's ability to offer generous guarantees to new nuclear financiers is under pressure. In this environment, Laidlaw risked being shot by his shareholders if he went ahead with an adventure where the uncertainties only ever seem to become greater. A share buyback, this one amounting to £500m, was always going to be better received by investors. The calculation for EdF, the 80% partner, may be different. Nuclear is a core business for the French state-controlled company and, outside China, it would be left with few opportunities if it joined Centrica in pulling out of new nuclear in the UK. Clearly, EdF will be at the negotiating table with the government until the final hour. But a vote of no confidence from Centrica is not going to help those negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/18/uk-energy-infrastructure-risk-cyber-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-18T18:50:44Z","webTitle":"UK energy infrastructure 'at risk of shutdown from cyber-attacks'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/18/uk-energy-infrastructure-risk-cyber-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/18/uk-energy-infrastructure-risk-cyber-attacks","fields":{"headline":"UK energy infrastructure 'at risk of shutdown from cyber-attacks'","bodyText":"A leading security expert whose company holds contracts with the Ministry of Defence has warned that Britain's energy infrastructure is at risk of shutdown from cyber-attacks and the actions of foreign owners. The warning from Chris McIntosh, a former lieutenant colonel in the Royal Signals and current chief executive of ViaSat UK, follows an invitation from George Osborne to Chinese companies to run UK nuclear reactors. \"What we have done in Britain is to have identified parts of our infrastructure as critical but not invested in them … Outsourcing to someone else not just makes them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks but allows the new owners to either invest or switch systems off. Would we consider outsourcing the army to China, or Germany or France?\" McIntosh said it was \"ridiculous\" to spend billions of pounds on building up an arsenal of frigates and fighter aircraft only for Britain to neglect an equally vital job of keeping the lights on in the home ports. He believed that ministers should look at different funding models for ensuring the UK had enough nuclear or other power stations under local control. McIntosh, whose ViaSat group is stock-listed in the US, also raised serious concerns about the threat of cybercrime from abroad, saying some foreign countries had seen their power systems damaged or temporarily shutdown. The planned introduction of smart meters would potentially allow a power company to turn off the lights in any home at any time. \"We need to have new regulations that dictate that energy companies introduce security systems that protect operational networks from attack. It is not strong enough to have guidelines suggesting the way … Utilities have taken action to protect their IT systems, but this work needs to be extended. It is not cheap to do it and the government needs to commit to an extensive cost benefit analysis.\" Announcing the agreement with Beijing that Chinese firms could take a minority stake in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset alongside EDF, Osborne said a majority stake might also be allowed in future. But a Treasury statement added: \"Any investment from any country has to comply with rigorous regulatory standards for safety and security.\" Awareness of the power of computer bugs or malware to cripple facilities was heightened after revelations in 2010 that a destructive system called Stuxnet had been developed in the US and inserted into the Iranian nuclear fuel factory at Natanz to contaminate uranium fuel supplies and slow the project. Meanwhile a report published by the Zpryme Research &amp; Consulting group earlier this year included a poll in which 63% of energy companies said they were \"very concerned\" about the prospects of cyber or network attacks. A further 33% said they were moderately concerned and 5% slightly concerned. Almost half of the respondents said they were most worried about the possibilities of a full power outage. Nick Butler, a former Number 10 energy policy adviser, has raised concerns about China and its links with cybercrime. In a blog last year he said: \"They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology.\" The unease inside the industry was reflected this week in a comment piece from Stuart Nathan, an editor on The Engineer trade magazine. He wrote: \"With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
